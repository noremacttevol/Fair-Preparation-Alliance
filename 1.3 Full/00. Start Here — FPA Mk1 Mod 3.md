Welcome to the **FPA Mk1Mod3** Knowledge Base. This is the primary navigation and orientation page for Fair Preparation Alliance members. The vault is organized into key categories (Governance, Operations, Membership, Communication, AI, Innovation, Knowledge/Gear), each containing focused notes. Browse the sections below to find the specific guidance or reference you need. _This index reflects the latest Phase 3 updates, including new distinctions like the internal **Realnet** versus external **Outernet** communication layers._ Use the links and descriptions to quickly jump to any document in the system.

## Governance

_Alliance purpose, strategy, and guiding principles for oversight and trust._

- [[1.1 - Mk1Mod3 Strategic Overview]] – High-level blueprint of FPA’s mission, phased growth plan, and overall strategy under the Mk1Mod3 model. (Provides context for current objectives and Phase 3 initiatives.)
    
- [[1.3 - FPA Trust Doctrine]] – The Alliance’s core philosophy on trust and security. Defines how trust is established, maintained, and protected among members to prevent threats or infiltration.
    
    - [[1.3.1 - Trust Firewall Mechanics]] – Technical and procedural details of the “trust firewall” system. Explains how FPA implements barriers and checks according to the Trust Doctrine, ensuring only vetted, trusted interactions and information flow.
        

## Ops (Operations)

_Day-to-day operations, protocols, and readiness planning for the Alliance._

- **2.1 Operations & Training:** _(Guides for executing tasks and building preparedness)_
    
    - [[2.1.1 - FPA Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)]] – Core procedures for daily operations and coordination. Covers routine workflows, chain-of-command in action, and standard protocols for consistent performance.
        
    - [[2.1.2 - Operational Readiness Progression (ORP) Plan]] – Roadmap for member training and capability-building. Outlines stages of preparedness (from basic to fully mission-ready) and the training milestones required at each level.
        
    - [[2.1.3 - “Test My Plan” Readiness Exercise]] – Self-evaluation questionnaire technique for stress-testing personal or team preparedness plans. Enables members to identify gaps in their plans by simulating crisis scenarios through guided Q&A.
        

## Membership

_Member roles, hierarchy, and internal structure of FPA’s team._

- [[3.1 - FPA Rank Structure]] – Outline of member ranks and roles within the Alliance. Details the hierarchy from new recruit up to leadership, including responsibilities at each level and how authority and decision-making are distributed (the chain of command).
    

## Communication

_Internal networks and external outreach channels for FPA._

- [[4.1 - Realnet (Internal P2P Communications)]] – The Alliance’s peer-to-peer communication network connecting members. Describes how members stay in contact directly through radios, messengers, and offline channels – the **active internal comms layer** that remains operational even in grid-down situations.
    
- [[4.2 - Outernet (External Media Outreach)]] – FPA’s outward-facing media layer for public communications. Covers how the Alliance broadcasts information to the outside world (e.g. social media, newsletters, or emergency broadcasts). **Outernet** is a Phase 3 initiative focused on outreach and influence beyond the core membership, distinguishing it from the internal Realnet.
    

## AI

_Integration of artificial intelligence and oversight within FPA operations._

- [[5.1 - AI Reliability & Human Oversight]] – Protocols ensuring that AI tools are used safely and effectively. Describes how the Alliance mitigates AI risks (like errors or bias) through human oversight, verification steps, and fail-safes, so that autonomous systems augment rather than endanger FPA decisions.
    
- [[5.2 - Core AI Demands Built into FPA]] – Fundamental requirements and constraints designed into FPA’s AI systems. Lists the non-negotiable principles (e.g. transparency, alignment with FPA values, data security, explainability) that any AI or algorithm must comply with to be trusted for Alliance use.
    
- [[5.3 - FPAi Tone and Voice Guidelines]] – Profile and communication style guide for FPA’s AI assistant (often referred to as **“FPAi”**). Defines the AI’s persona, tone, and language – ensuring it speaks with an appropriate, consistent voice when interacting with members or the public (e.g. calm, informative, and aligned with FPA’s operational realism).
    

## Innovation

_New projects, tools, and initiatives under development to advance FPA’s mission._

- [[6.1 - FPA Mobile App White Paper]] – Concept and design overview for the proposed FPA mobile application. Summarizes the app’s envisioned features (such as member directories, alert systems, skill trackers), its use cases, and the development roadmap to bring this digital tool to life.
    
- [[6.2 - SHTF-Ready Notebook Design]] – Comprehensive design document for the **“SHTF-Ready” Notebook**, a personal preparedness journal and reference tool. Covers the notebook’s layout, content (checklists, logs, the so-called “SHTF Bible” of survival info), and how it will help members track readiness and training progress in a tangible, offline format.
    

## Knowledge/Gear

_Reference systems, training materials, and resilient infrastructure for information._

- [[7.1 - FPA Dictionary System Overview]] – Explanation of FPA’s internal lexicon and terminology system. Ensures everyone uses consistent definitions for key terms, acronyms, and concepts. (This “dictionary” is a quick reference for all unique FPA jargon and operational terms.)
    
- [[7.2 - FPA Q&A Knowledge Base]] – Central repository of questions and answers for common scenarios and challenges. Collects hard-earned lessons and FAQs from members, so that proven solutions and guidance are easily searchable. (A living knowledge base capturing the Alliance’s collective wisdom.)
    
- [[7.3 - Offline-First Resilience System]] – Design of FPA’s information and communication systems to work with little or no internet connectivity. Details how data, comms, and coordination tools are made resilient (through local servers, mesh networks, radio, etc.), ensuring continuity in **grid-down** or remote situations.
    
- [[7.4 - “SHTF Bible” & Skills Training System]] – Concept for a comprehensive survival manual (the **“SHTF Bible”**) coupled with a structured skills training program for members. Describes the content and usage of the SHTF Bible (a vault of survival knowledge and checklists) and how it integrates with hands-on training modules to build member competencies over time.
