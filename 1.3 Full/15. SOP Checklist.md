...# Personal SOP Checklist

**Your FPA Personal SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) Checklist** is a step-by-step guide to becoming a reliable and active member of the Fair Preparation Alliance. This isn’t abstract advice – it’s a blunt list of what you need to _do_. By following this checklist, you ensure you meet FPA’s Phase 1 expectations for individual readiness and set yourself up for greater responsibilities in Phase 2 and 3. Think of it as your prepper “to-do list” with the Alliance: it covers training, gear, personal readiness, and squad participation. Complete these items, and you won’t just call yourself an FPA member – you’ll **prove** it. _(If any terms or tools are unfamiliar, refer to the **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]**. If you want to understand the philosophy behind these tasks, see the **[[Compass Guide]]**.)_

## Getting Started

**Before you dive in:** This checklist is written in actionable terms. Many items are ongoing duties rather than one-time tasks – preparedness is never “one and done.” Phase 1 is our grassroots stage, meaning resources are limited and _your personal effort matters immensely_. There’s no high-tech substitute or big bureaucracy to pick up your slack. The tone here is intentionally direct: each point tells you exactly what FPA expects you to do. It might feel like a lot – take it one step at a time. As you check off items, you’ll gain competence and confidence, and you’ll be contributing to your squad and community in real ways. Let’s get to it.

## Personal Checklist – Phase 1 Essentials

1. **Sign the pledge and commit:** Complete your FPA membership application, including signing the member agreement and **paying your first $5** dues. This nominal fee activates your membership. More importantly, you’re pledging to uphold FPA’s values (fairness, integrity, teamwork, etc.) and to put in work, not just words. _(If you haven’t done this yet, do not pass Go – the FPA is for committed members only.)_
    
2. **Run “Test My Plan” for a reality check:** Use the **[[Test My Plan]]** AI tool (or the paper equivalent questionnaire) to evaluate your current emergency plan. Input details about how you’d handle a disaster _right now_. The tool will spit out an assessment of your strengths and weaknesses​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. Pay attention to the weaknesses! This is your starting baseline. Print or save the suggestions it gives – you’ll be addressing them as you work through the rest of this checklist. (If you don’t have a personal plan at all, the tool will guide you to create one. Either way, do this first to identify your gaps.)
    
3. **Share a useful tip or resource:** Post at least one actionable preparedness tip, gear review, or useful find to the FPA community (on the app’s forum or at a meeting). For example, maybe you recently tested a cheap water filter – share how it went. Or you found a good deal on bulk first aid supplies – tell others. This isn’t about getting likes; it’s about contributing knowledge from day one. FPA thrives on information sharing, and every member is expected to add to the pool. _(In Phase 1, this could be as simple as bringing up your tip in your squad’s group chat or meeting.)_ By speaking up early, you also signal to everyone that you’re here to participate, not lurk in the shadows.
    
4. **Secure your basic gear (“Day Zero” kit):** Assemble your personal **go-bag / Bug-Out Bag (BOB)** if you haven’t already​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. This is fundamental. At minimum, pack a 72-hour supply of essentials: water (and/or filter), non-perishable food, first aid kit, flashlight, multi-tool, fire starter, extra clothes, and important personal items (medications, copies of IDs). Refer to the FPA-approved gear list and the SHTF Bible’s checklist for guidance on what your bag should have. Then **actually show your squad leader or a buddy** that you have it ready – accountability matters. No one expects you to have top-of-the-line gear on day one; use what you have and can afford. But do the best you can to cover the basics immediately. (If you literally have nothing yet, even gathering a few water bottles, canned food, and a flashlight in a backpack is a start.) _Tip:_ Also prepare a small Everyday Carry kit – a few items you keep on you (knife, lighter, etc.) for daily preparedness​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag.
    
5. **Complete “Day Zero Basics” training:** Every new member must go through the FPA “Day Zero Basics” orientation. This is a short training module (online video or in-person workshop) that covers the absolute fundamentals: how to respond in the first 24 hours of a crisis. It includes: emergency communications 101, the Rule of 3’s (air, shelter, water, food priorities), basic OPSEC dos and don’ts, and immediate first aid (like how to stop bleeding). **Complete this training and pass the quick quiz.** It ensures that if something bad happened _tomorrow_, you wouldn’t be totally lost. If you’re unsure how to access this training, ask your squad lead – they might even run a quick group session. This step is required to advance beyond the newbie rank (E-1). It’s literally the knowledge to get you through “Day Zero” of any event, hence the name.
    
6. **Get on the comms net (at least as a listener):** Communication is life in an emergency. The FPA expects every member to have at least one way to get information off-grid. Easiest: buy an FRS/GMRS walkie-talkie or a basic **HAM radio** receiver. Even if you’re not licensed to transmit yet, you can **listen** to the FPA’s emergency channel (your local chapter will tell you which frequency to monitor, often part of our “Outernet” radio network). Do a radio check with your squad – e.g. at a scheduled time, ensure you can hear them or they can hear you on the radio. If you have a HAM license already, great, start joining the weekly **Pulse Test** nets (radio check-ins) to practice​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. If not, consider this step your impetus to study for at least the entry-level HAM license (Technician in the US)​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. _Phase 1 reality:_ not everyone will transmit on HAM, but everyone **must** have a means to receive critical info. If you’re truly broke and can’t get a radio yet, coordinate with your squad – maybe you can be the designated runner to someone who has one. One way or another, get plugged into the communication loop beyond just cell phones.
    
7. **Attend your first squad meeting or drill:** Don’t be a stranger. FPA is not an armchair forum – it’s people doing things together. If there’s an in-person meeting, _show up_. If it’s online for now, log in and participate. Introduce yourself, and more importantly **listen** and learn from others. Volunteer for at least one task or role, even if it’s small. For example, offer to help organize the next meet-up, or to bring a needed item for a drill (like “I’ll bring printouts of the evacuation route map”). Early involvement earns trust. Also, completing this step is typically required to move from Probationary status to full Active member. We’ve had folks join on paper but never engage – those people don’t last. By making sure you attend something within your first month, you cement your place in the team and get that much more comfortable working with the group. _FPA expects members to prioritize squad activities._ We all have busy lives, but if you consistently can’t make time for even a monthly meeting, that’s a red flag – address it.
    
8. **Practice a personal emergency drill:** Plan and execute a simple drill at home. For instance, one evening simulate a **power outage**: turn off your mains power and see how you cope for 8-12 hours. Use your flashlight, cook a meal with your backup stove or eat stored food, test your generator or battery bank if you have one, and practice communication (call or radio a fellow member to report your status). Alternatively, do a **bug-out drill**: pick a scenario (chemical spill, etc.), actually grab your family and bug-out bags, and drive to your designated bug-out location, or at least go through the motions of packing the car and discussing the route. The goal is to reveal holes in your plan. After the drill, make note of any problems (e.g. “my flashlight batteries were dead,” “we took too long to gather things,” “I realized I had no plan for the dog”). Share these findings with your squad so others learn too. This kind of personal drill is _expected within your first 2-3 months_ of joining. It proves that you’re not just accumulating gear – you’re training yourself to use it. Plus, it often motivates you to fix shortcomings immediately (nothing like sitting in the dark to remind you to buy extra batteries).
    
9. **Earn a basic certification or skill badge:** The FPA offers (or recognizes) several basic skills certifications – and every member should earn at least one in their early tenure. Examples: complete a **certified First Aid/CPR course**, or get your HAM radio license, or take an online FEMA ICS (Incident Command System) introductory course, or attend a firearms safety class (if appropriate in your context). These are tangible milestones that improve your usefulness to the group. Pick one path that interests you and commit to achieving it. The alliance might award you a badge or patch for it (for instance, an FPA First Aid patch if you show proof of Red Cross first aid certification). This isn’t about the patch itself; it’s about building real capability. By Phase 2, we anticipate every member will have multiple such qualifications so that squads have a diverse skill set. In Phase 1, we’re just getting started – so plant those seeds now. Choose a weekend within the next two months to get at least one cert under your belt. When disaster strikes, those with training step forward – be one of those people.
    
10. **Contribute to a group project or drill:** Beyond your personal drills and meetings, try to add value to a larger FPA initiative. For example, if your region is organizing a community workshop (say, teaching neighbors how to purify water), volunteer to help out – even if just handing out flyers or setting up chairs. Or if the alliance is developing a new SOP and asks for member input, give yours. Or maybe your squad decides to collectively build a “gear pool” of extra supplies – chip in an item. The idea is to _go beyond just taking care of yourself_ and actively support the FPA’s broader mission. In Phase 1, resources are limited, so these projects rely on member enthusiasm. Your extra effort could mean the difference between an initiative happening or fizzling. And from the perspective of FPA leadership, members who step up like this are the ones marked for future promotion. This is how you earn **Alliance Points** in a big way – doing things that benefit the whole community, not just you or your immediate circle.
    
11. **Log your progress and stay accountable:** Keep a simple log of what you’ve done – dates you completed each of these checklist items, and any quantifiable details (e.g. “Sep 10: power-outage drill 10 hours, learned need more water storage”). This isn’t busywork; it helps you and your leaders track your development. Many squads do quick readiness audits where each member reports on their status. If you can say, “I’ve done X, Y, Z since joining,” that builds confidence in the group that you’re reliable. Conversely, if months go by and you haven’t checked off certain basics, expect your squadmates to call you out (in a constructive way). The FPA culture is supportive but frank: we hold each other to standards because it may literally be life-saving. By Phase 2, we’ll have better tools for tracking training and points automatically, but Phase 1 relies on personal honor and manual reporting. So hold yourself accountable. Review this checklist periodically – if something’s not done, make a plan to do it. Preparedness is a habit as much as a task list.
    

That covers the essentials. If you’ve completed all the above, congratulations – you’re functioning at 100% of Phase 1 expectations! You’ve proven you’re not just another sign-up; you’re an active asset to the Alliance. Your reward will be apparent the day something bad happens – you’ll be ready and you’ll have a team of equally prepared people with you. But in the meantime, there’s also a more immediate reward: **Alliance Points (AP)** and rank advancement.

### Alliance Points (AP) and Earning Your Rank

**Alliance Points (AP)** are the lifeblood of FPA’s member recognition system. Think of AP like experience points in a game – you earn them for every constructive action you take, and as you accumulate them, you level up (advance in rank). Why do we use AP? To instill a culture of _action and merit_. In the FPA, rank isn’t given based on who you know or how long you’ve been around; it’s earned by doing what helps the alliance.

Here’s how it works in practice: Each checklist item above, and many other activities, have AP values assigned. For example, when you completed the “Day Zero Basics” training, that might automatically award, say, 10 AP. Attending a squad drill could be 5 AP. Getting your First Aid certification might give 20 AP, and so on. Your squad leader or the app (if you log it) updates your AP tally. Accumulate a certain amount, and provided you’ve met any skill prerequisites, you get promoted to the next rank (E-2, E-3, etc.). Early ranks are easy to achieve – an active new member can reach **E-2** within a couple of months. Higher ranks naturally require more points and demonstration of leadership skills (for instance, to make E-4 you might need to have mentored a newer member in addition to points).

AP isn’t just about individuals – it’s motivating the _whole community_. We celebrate top contributors. There may be a leaderboard (perhaps by alias if privacy is a concern) showing who’s putting in work – not to foster unhealthy competition, but to give credit and inspire others. The FPA may even offer small rewards: e.g. a special patch for the person with the most training hours in a quarter, or priority in receiving new gear prototypes to test.

**Quality control:** To keep the system fair, most AP-earning activities require verification. You can’t just claim “I did a 24-hour solo survival trip” and get points unless someone can vouch for it or you provide some proof. Many tasks are group-observed by design, so this isn’t as hard as it sounds – e.g. your squad saw you at the drill, or your course certificate is your proof. Cheating the system would only hurt you and everyone else, and any blatant dishonesty is grounds for disciplinary action (we take integrity seriously). Plus, points or badges earned without real skill behind them will become obvious in the next emergency or challenge, and that embarrassment is on you. So do it right.

**Using AP for promotion opportunities:** Your rank in the FPA structure (E-1 through E-9) determines what roles you can take. As a newcomer (E-1) you’re in learning mode. Hitting E-2 and E-3 shows you’re proficient in basics and reliable – at that point you might be trusted to lead a small team for a task or manage a specific resource. By E-4 or E-5, you’re in chapter leadership territory (maybe becoming an assistant squad leader or training coordinator). So climbing ranks opens doors to more influence and responsibility. The Alliance Points system is the ladder. Community benefit and personal growth go hand-in-hand here: the more you do for the FPA, the more authority the FPA gives you to do even more good.

One cool aspect: AP resets _never_. Your points accumulate across your entire FPA career. Even when you hit a new rank, the excess points carry over. And if we ever need to implement something like commendations or awards, those can translate into bonus AP. Long-term, Phase 3 might bring in AI analysis to ensure AP corresponds tightly with actual impact (to refine point values, etc.), but Phase 1 is straightforward – humans tracking human contributions.

In summary, **Alliance Points are your motivator and measurement.** Treat them as a fun challenge: “How many points can I rack up this month by doing things that genuinely make me and my community more prepared?” Before you know it, you’ll look back and realize how far you’ve come – not because of some arbitrary score, but because each point represented a real step forward.

_(Curious what tasks give what points? Check the FPA member portal or ask a leader for the AP allocation chart. It lists common activities and their values. But generally, if you’re doing what’s on this checklist and then some, the points will follow.)_

### Looking Ahead: Phase 2 and 3 Responsibilities

The checklist above is geared to Phase 1 – our current situation of relatively small, local-focused groups. As the FPA grows into Phase 2 and Phase 3, your responsibilities as a member will evolve. It’s important to know what’s on the horizon, **because we want Phase-1 members to be the ones who lead the charge in later phases.** By knocking out your basics now, you’ll be first in line for advanced opportunities later.

Here’s a taste of what comes next (so you can start preparing for it now in small ways):

- **Phase 2 (Growth) – Training Others:** In Phase 2, with thousands of new members pouring in, one of the biggest needs will be _experienced members to train recruits_. If you’ve mastered your skills and know the FPA way, you might be tapped to run workshops or lead drills for newcomers. Start thinking about what you excel at or enjoy – could you become your squad’s go-to radio instructor? Or maybe you’re passionate about medical skills and could mentor a first aid squad. Phase 2 will likely introduce formal “Trainer” roles (for example, rank E-8 in our plan is a Trainer position for those who specialize in teaching​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag). Pay attention to how your leaders train you now; it’ll inform how you train others later. Also, Phase 2 means more squads forming – you might be split off to help form a new squad if your current one grows too large, essentially becoming a squad leader. So absorb leadership lessons from your current leaders. The better you handle your Phase-1 checklist, the sooner you’ll be ready to guide others in Phase 2.
    
- **Phase 2 – Specialized Teams and Projects:** With greater numbers comes the ability to form specialized teams. For example, the FPA might establish a **Comms Team** in each region (manning the Outernet frequency and maintaining radio equipment), a **Medical Team**, a **Security Team**, etc. Regular members might choose a track to focus on. Begin considering where you’d fit best. Do you see yourself as part of a rapid response unit traveling to aid neighboring towns? Or maybe contributing to the development of improved SOPs with the AI team? Start deepening the skills that interest you. By Phase 2, we’ll also roll out more advanced **drills** – multi-squad exercises, perhaps regional “mock disasters.” Expect your participation requirements to go up a notch in both complexity and frequency. It won’t be just “have a go-bag” but maybe “help coordinate a community relief event.” Use Phase 1 to build stamina and breadth so Phase 2 doesn’t overwhelm you.
    
- **Phase 3 (Expansion) – Leadership & Automation:** In Phase 3, the alliance becomes a large network possibly integrated with AI-run systems. The good news: many routine tasks might get easier (the AI might handle scheduling, resource tracking, maybe even generate training scenarios for you). The flip side: human oversight is critical to ensure the AI outputs make sense and align with our ethics. As a Phase-1 vetted member, you may find yourself on an **oversight committee** or advisory board, shaping how those AI tools are used. Phase 3 could also see members being mobilized on a national scale – e.g., if there’s a huge disaster in one region, members from across the country might coordinate to send aid or even physically travel to assist (like volunteer deployments). By then you should be adept at your roles so you can plug into a larger operation seamlessly. We envision a time when an FPA member in California can radio an FPA member in New York for help on something and it’s just like talking to a squadmate. That unity comes from the common framework you’re learning now. Additionally, Phase 3 may involve working closely with government or NGOs in disaster response. Members will have to uphold the highest standards of conduct to represent the Alliance well. The leadership opportunities are immense: roles like regional director, training program manager, tech platform curator – these will be filled mostly by those who have been with FPA since Phase 1 or 2 and proved themselves. Stick with it and that could be you.
    

In short, **Phase 1 is about making yourself solid.** Phase 2 will be about multiplying that knowledge to others and strengthening your local chapter as we scale. Phase 3 will be about integrating into a nationwide resilient fabric and possibly stepping onto an even bigger stage as part of FPA’s leadership or specialized forces.

So, as you dutifully check off the Phase-1 items, keep an eye on your interests and emerging strengths. Discuss with your squad what Phase-2 growth might mean – maybe you collectively prepare by identifying who could take what role when membership doubles. The Alliance will guide these transitions, but bottom-up readiness is just as important.

## Final Notes

This checklist might look intimidating at first glance, but remember: **every current FPA leader started with these very same steps.** They just kept at them and then went beyond. If you tackle one item at a time, you’ll be surprised how quickly momentum builds. The aim isn’t perfection; it’s consistent progress and participation.

Phase 1 is the toughest phase because we’re building from scratch. There’s minimal AI assistance, limited funds, and few precedents. That means _you_ – your hands, your brain, your heart – are the primary engine moving the Alliance forward. The Personal SOP Checklist is essentially the maintenance schedule for that engine. Follow it, and you won’t stall out.

Also, never forget _why_ you’re doing this. Yes, it’s a checklist of tasks, but behind each task is the vision of a prepared, resilient community. When you secure your go-bag, that means when disaster hits, you won’t be the one needing rescue – you’ll be able to help others. When you attend training, you could gain the skill that saves a life one day. When you check in on the radio, you reinforce a lifeline that might be the only link across a region in crisis. Each individual effort ties into the bigger safety net we’re weaving together.

Lastly, use your fellow FPA members as resources. If you’re struggling with a particular item (say, you can’t find a good deal on a generator or you’re unsure how to bury a cache), ask around – someone likely has advice or a spare item to help you. We succeed as a team or fail alone; FPA chooses to succeed together.

**Stay accountable, stay active, and keep pushing forward.** This checklist will evolve as we enter new phases, but the fundamentals won’t. And neither will the expectation that an FPA member is someone who _gets things done_. Be that member. Your community and the entire Alliance are counting on it.

_Now, check your gear, charge your radio, and let’s get to work._ ✔️
