# FPA Rank Structure and Progression System

## Introduction

The FPA (Alliance) rank structure is a comprehensive progression system that recognizes members’ contributions and skills in emergency preparedness. It is designed to be fair, transparent, and tied directly to **contribution rather than privilege**. All members begin at the entry-level and advance through **enlisted ranks (E-1 through E-10)** by completing required preparedness tasks and earning **Alliance Points (AP)**. No one can skip ranks – each level builds on core skills and must be earned in sequence. After achieving the highest enlisted rank (E-10), members can branch into either an **Officer Track (O-1 through O-10)** for elected leadership roles or a **Prestige Track** for expert contributors who prefer a creative/support role instead of command. In all cases, higher rank brings **greater responsibility and recognition** – **not special perks or access**. Every member, regardless of rank, has the same tools and information available; rank simply reflects one’s experience, trust, and contributions to the Alliance’s mission.

This document outlines the **full FPA rank structure from E-1 to O-10**, including rank titles, requirements for advancement, AP thresholds, and validation processes. It also describes the **Alliance Points system** (how members earn points via various activities), the **two post-Enlisted paths (Officer and Prestige)**, and the **principles of fairness** underlying the system. This structured approach ensures that as members advance, they develop critical survival skills (like planning, communication, and leadership) in a logical order, strengthening both the individual and the Alliance as a whole.

## Alliance Points (AP) System and Rank Advancement

**Alliance Points (AP)** are the core metric for measuring member activity and contributions. Members earn AP by participating in or leading approved activities that further preparedness and the Alliance’s goals. To advance in rank, a member must meet or exceed the required AP threshold (AP floor) **and** complete specific milestone tasks for that rank. AP provides flexibility – members can accumulate points through a variety of activities – but **completing the required milestone tasks (“rank gates”) is mandatory** for each rank. In other words, you can’t bypass a critical skill milestone just by grinding points; both elements are needed for promotion.

**AP-Earning Categories:** The FPA defines **10 categories of activities** through which members can earn Alliance Points. This ensures a well-rounded contribution system and allows members to play to their strengths while still covering all bases over time. The categories include a mix of training, leadership, technical skills, and community involvement:

1. **Training & Knowledge Assessments:** Points for completing educational modules, passing preparedness quizzes/tests, and obtaining certifications (e.g. first aid, CERT, NIMS, etc.).
    
2. **Personal Preparedness Tasks:** Points for developing personal/family emergency plans, assembling survival kits, and maintaining personal readiness (e.g. updating your plan annually).
    
3. **Communication Operations:** Points for communication-related activities, such as acquiring and learning to use radios, checking into emergency nets, making contact with other members via HAM/GMRS, etc.
    
4. **Drill Participation:** Points for taking part in organized drills and simulations (blackout drills, evacuation exercises, etc.) as a team member.
    
5. **Drill & Mission Leadership:** Additional points for planning or leading drills and missions. Leading a neighborhood exercise or coordinating an operation earns more AP than just participating.
    
6. **Field Exercises & Scenarios:** Points for completing scenario challenges (e.g. 24-hour off-grid “blackout” challenge, wilderness survival weekend, EMP simulation). These test field readiness in realistic conditions.
    
7. **Gear Preparedness & Validation:** Points for acquiring recommended gear and demonstrating its use or hardening gear against threats. For example, building an EMP-proof case for electronics, or testing backup power generators earns AP.
    
8. **Mentorship & Peer Support:** Points for mentoring other members (e.g. guiding a new member through making their plan, or helping someone study for their HAM exam). Also includes reviewing/vetting peers’ emergency plans or setups and providing constructive feedback.
    
9. **Community Outreach & Training:** Points for activities that spread preparedness beyond the Alliance – such as hosting public workshops, giving preparedness presentations, recruiting new members, or organizing public-facing drills and community events.
    
10. **Mission & Project Contributions:** Points for contributing to official missions or projects of the Alliance. This can range from staff work on a regional mission, assisting in logistics for an event, to creating educational content or tools for the group. Significant innovation (like developing a new training course or a custom piece of gear adopted Alliance-wide) also falls here.
    

Members can earn AP in any combination of these categories, encouraging a diverse skill set. However, **major rank milestones have specific tasks that must be done to advance** – you can’t substitute one category for another when it comes to those required tasks. For example, no matter how many points you earn from attending drills, you _must_ still pass the radio license exam to reach the rank that requires it. The AP system is meant to reward ongoing engagement and allow some personalization, while the required rank tasks ensure every member has the critical skills and experiences appropriate to their level.

**AP Progression and Slope:** Each rank has an increasing AP requirement. Generally, **each successive rank demands more AP than the last**, reflecting the greater effort and contribution needed as one rises. The table later in this document details the AP “floor” for each rank and an “AP slope” value indicating how much more AP is needed compared to the previous rank. In early ranks the increases are modest, but by higher ranks the AP gaps grow larger – ensuring that senior ranks represent significantly greater cumulative contribution. This progression can be visualized as a slope that gets steeper at higher levels (meaning it takes more effort to climb from one rank to the next as you ascend).

**Validation Process:** In addition to AP and task completion, rank promotions require validation – a check that the member indeed met the requirements and is ready for the next level of trust. The validation level becomes more rigorous at higher ranks. Lower ranks might be automatically granted by the system or a mentor once tasks are done (basic validation), while higher ranks require peer review or even a vote. The FPA uses several levels of validation: an **automatic check (no human approval needed)**, **mentor or senior member approval**, **peer/squad vote**, **Board review/approval** (by a committee or leadership board), and finally **full membership vote** for the most important transitions. Each rank has an assigned “validation type” and a corresponding numeric index (0 for auto, 1 for mentor sign-off, 2 for peer vote, 3 for board sign-off, 4 for full member vote). As you progress, the validation moves from an individual mentor’s approval up to the collective approval of the whole Alliance for the highest positions. This ensures **trust and transparency** – when someone reaches a high rank, many others have had a say in confirming that achievement.

In summary, **to advance a rank you need**: (1) to complete all required tasks for that rank, (2) to accumulate at least the minimum AP required, and (3) to pass the specified validation process. The following sections describe the ranks in detail and how members progress through them.

## Enlisted Core Path (E-1 to E-10)

All members begin in the **Core Enlisted Path**, progressing through ranks E-1 to E-10. These ten ranks cover the fundamental and advanced skills every member must acquire. This path ensures everyone has a solid baseline of personal preparedness before taking on leadership or specialized roles. **No skipping is allowed** – every member, regardless of background, goes through these stages to build common ground and core competency.

### E-1 to E-5: Foundational Preparedness Milestones

**Ranks E-1 through E-5 focus on personal preparedness and basic operational skills.** New members learn to prepare themselves and get introduced to the Alliance’s communication network and knowledge base. The first five ranks and their key milestones are:

- **E-1 (Novice):** Create a **personal emergency plan** for yourself/your family and assemble a basic emergency kit. This foundational plan covers how you’d handle common disasters, evacuation routes, contacts, etc. Completing this plan (and sharing it with a mentor for feedback) earns you the first rank, Novice. _(AP earned along the way: initial points for making the plan and starting your preparedness journey.)_
    
- **E-2 (Apprentice):** Build your knowledge through formal learning. At this stage, you **pass basic preparedness quizzes** covering disaster awareness, safety procedures, and Alliance guidelines. This confirms you’ve absorbed essential preparedness concepts. _(AP: points from completing training modules and quizzes.)_
    
- **E-3 (Communicator):** Acquire your first field gear with a focus on communication. Typically, you **obtain a reliable radio** (for example, an FRS/GMRS handheld or an entry-level HAM radio) and demonstrate basic operating skills with it. You learn how to power it via backup battery, how to tune to the Alliance’s channels, etc. _(AP: points for gear acquisition and a successful radio check with a mentor.)_
    
- **E-4 (Operator):** Put your comms gear to use in a practical way – **establish direct communication with another member** in an emergency-communication context. For instance, you coordinate a scheduled radio check or exchange a prepared message with a fellow member using your equipment (or an alternate emergency channel). This proves you can actually get a message through to your network when needed. _(AP: points for completing a two-way comms test and logging it in the system.)_
    
- **E-5 (Technician):** Earn an **FCC Amateur Radio license** (Technician class or equivalent) by studying and passing the HAM radio exam. This certifies your commitment to communication readiness and legally empowers you to use a wide range of radio frequencies during emergencies. Reaching E-5 means you have both the knowledge and credentials to be an effective radio operator for the Alliance. _(AP: significant points for achieving a public certification; you likely also participate in a group radio net as practice.)_
    

By the end of E-5, an FPA member has a solid personal preparedness plan, basic supplies, a working knowledge of emergency protocols, and effective communication capability (with proper licensing). These core skills lay the groundwork for more advanced, field-oriented challenges in the next tier of ranks.

### E-6 to E-10: Advanced Field and Leadership Milestones

**Ranks E-6 through E-10 are the advanced stage of the core path, emphasizing field readiness, technical proficiency, and leadership.** In these ranks, members prove they can operate under adverse conditions, lead others, and contribute back to the Alliance’s collective knowledge. Key milestones for E-6 to E-10 include:

- **E-6 (Specialist):** Prove your ability to function during a crisis by **passing a “blackout” field scenario.** You must successfully complete a **24-hour off-grid simulation** – essentially, live through a full day (and night) with no external power, simulating a widespread blackout or EMP event. During this period, you demonstrate use of backup power or off-grid skills, and crucially, **maintain communications in the dark** (using your radio on battery/solar power through the night). This shows you can apply your skills in a realistic disaster scenario. _(AP: points for completing the scenario and documenting your experience; extra points if you assist others or coordinate with a team during the drill.)_
    
- **E-7 (Leader):** Step into a leadership role on a small scale. At E-7, you **plan and lead a team drill** under challenging conditions. For example, you might organize a neighborhood emergency response exercise or lead your local FPA squad in a night-time communications drill. You’ll be responsible for coordinating the participants, running the scenario (such as a simulated storm or evacuation), and debriefing lessons learned. Successfully running this drill – with peers attesting to your effective leadership – earns you the Leader rank. _(AP: points for drill leadership, scenario planning, and after-action reporting.)_
    
- **E-8 (Mentor):** Begin formally **mentoring others and sharing your expertise.** At this rank, you take on at least one junior member (or a small group) and coach them through their early ranks – helping them improve their emergency plans, giving them tips to pass their tests, and validating their progress. You also **vet others’ preparedness plans** as a peer reviewer, providing constructive feedback and helping to improve those plans. This develops your teaching skills and strengthens the whole group. _(AP: points for each member mentored or plan reviewed; this also builds peer respect which is crucial for validation.)_
    
- **E-9 (Instructor):** Take your mentorship to a broader audience and demonstrate technical ingenuity. To reach E-9, you must **run an advanced training course or workshop for multiple members** _and_ complete a significant technical project. For instance, you might design and lead a multi-session course on wilderness survival or advanced first aid for fellow members. Additionally, you **build and demonstrate an EMP-proof gear solution** – such as constructing a Faraday cage or hardened communication device – showcasing an expert level of technical preparedness. By teaching others and innovating new solutions, you solidify your status as an Instructor. _(AP: points for course development, number of members trained, and successful testing of the EMP-hardened gear.)_
    
- **E-10 (Master):** Achieve the capstone of the core path by orchestrating a large-scale event and demonstrating complete mastery. E-10 requires you to **organize and lead a major emergency preparedness exercise** that involves either the public or multiple regional teams. For example, you might coordinate a city-wide blackout drill in cooperation with local CERT teams or host a public disaster-preparedness fair and simulation. This event tests your ability to plan logistics, manage large groups, liaise with external organizations, and showcase the Alliance’s capabilities openly. Reaching E-10 “Master” means you have earned the full confidence of the Alliance: you’ve mastered personal and technical skills and have proven leadership and outreach abilities. _(AP: points for scale of event, number of participants, and impact; validation for Master typically involves Alliance leadership confirming you have met all criteria.)_
    

By the end of the Enlisted core path, an FPA member is a well-rounded **preparedness expert**. They have not only prepared themselves and their family, but have also led teams, mentored others, engineered solutions to problems (like EMP protection), and run community-level initiatives. An E-10 Master is respected as a veteran member who can be trusted in any emergency and who actively lifts others up. This is the launching point for either taking on higher leadership responsibilities or pursuing specialized contributions through the post-enlisted forks described next.

## Officer Track (O-1 to O-10)

The **Officer Track** is an optional path available **after completing E-10**, for those who want to take on formal leadership roles within the Alliance. Officer ranks **O-1 through O-10** correspond to positions of authority overseeing larger groups and missions, from local squad leader up to the national Alliance commander. Unlike the enlisted ranks, which are permanent achievements, officer positions are typically **time-limited appointments or terms** – they are roles one holds while actively leading, often achieved through an election or selection process by one’s peers.

**Entry into the Officer Track:** To become an officer (O-1), a member must be an E-10 Master and then be **voted into a leadership position**. Usually this means your local group or a committee elects you as a Team or Unit leader. This election by peers serves as validation (a full-member or peer vote) that others trust you to lead. There is no skipping: even the most capable person must first go through all enlisted ranks and prove themselves as a Master before they are eligible to hold an officer post.

**Progression through Officer Ranks:** Advancing from O-1 up to O-10 is tied to taking on **larger scopes of leadership** and successfully fulfilling those duties. While enlisted ranks were about skill-building, officer ranks are about **command and organizational responsibility**:

- **O-1 to O-3 (Local/Section Leadership):** At O-1 (Team Leader), you might command a small squad or chapter. By O-2 (Unit Leader), you could oversee multiple teams in your area. O-3 (Section Officer) might have you coordinating several units or an entire district operation. Promotions at this level might involve being re-elected or selected to lead at a slightly bigger scale (often still by peer votes of the members in those groups). Your AP will continue to grow through leadership activities (drills led, missions accomplished) and you’ll need to demonstrate success for each step – e.g. a track record of effective team performance to move from O-1 to O-2.
    
- **O-4 to O-6 (Regional Leadership):** These ranks represent leadership of broader areas. An O-4 (District Officer) might be responsible for all Alliance teams in a city or county. An O-5 (Regional Officer) could lead an entire state or multi-county region’s membership. By O-6 (Regional Director), you may be supervising multiple region leaders or serving on the Alliance’s executive council. Advancements here typically require a **Board or council approval** in addition to any regional member votes – i.e. the Alliance’s leadership board must sign off that you have the experience and support to take on such a major role. Each promotion likely coincides with either election by a larger body of members (e.g., all members in the region) or appointment by the national leadership after consultation.
    
- **O-7 to O-10 (National Leadership):** These are the top leadership echelons of FPA. O-7 and O-8 are **National Staff Officers/Directors** who hold significant nationwide responsibilities (for example, one might be the National Communications Officer, another the Training Director, etc.). They implement strategy across all regions and often lead nationwide missions or programs. These positions might be appointed by the Alliance Commander and board, based on expertise, or elected by a congress of members – the validation at this level is high (board signoff or full membership vote). O-9 is the **Deputy Alliance Commander** (or equivalent title such as Vice-Commander) – effectively second-in-command of the entire organization, usually elected by the full membership or appointed as a running mate to the Alliance Commander. O-10 is the **Alliance Commander**, the top leader who sets the vision and leads the Alliance nationally; this role is definitely elected by a full-membership ballot (all members vote) given its importance. Terms may be limited (for example, a 1 or 2-year term after which a new election is held).
    

Throughout the officer track, **Alliance Points continue to accumulate** from leadership activities, but promotions are more heavily dependent on **validation (votes/approvals)** and the successful completion of mission objectives, rather than predefined “tasks” like in enlisted ranks. An officer must demonstrate results: e.g., a Regional Officer (O-5) should have run multiple successful regional exercises, increased membership in their region, or improved readiness metrics, before moving up to Regional Director (O-6).

**Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Option:** The officer track also **includes a “Chief Warrant Officer” fork** for specialized leadership at the national level without line command. This is designed for members who are technical experts and whose contributions are needed in national leadership, but who may not be in a standard command hierarchy. For example, an individual who is a communications or engineering genius might be appointed as a **CWO** to advise the Alliance on technology and lead specific programs, without having to command troops/units. In practice, a CWO in FPA would be a _national-level specialist_ – equivalent in prestige to a senior officer – who reports directly to the top leadership on their specialty. CWOs are typically appointed by the Alliance Commander and confirmed by the Board (validation level similar to other national officers). They hold an officer rank (often aligned with O-7/O-8 level in status) but their role is advisory/technical rather than commanding field teams. This allows the Alliance to benefit from top talent in strategy and innovation even if those individuals prefer not to manage large groups.

**Time-Limited Roles and Returning to Enlisted:** Officer roles are not permanent promotions – they are positions of service. Many officer roles have term limits or mission-specific durations. After fulfilling an officer term, a member might either be re-elected/appointed to continue, move to a higher office, or step back. If they step back, typically they retain their E-10 Master status (and of course the experience gained). In this way, **rank = contribution, not privilege** – holding an officer rank is about serving the Alliance, not gaining personal perks. Officers are expected to meet higher standards of conduct and transparency since they are entrusted with leading peers.

## Prestige Track (E-10 Custom “Prestige” Role)

Not every veteran member wants to take on a command or administrative role, yet many still have a drive to contribute creatively or in specialized ways. The **Prestige Track** offers an alternative path for **E-10 Masters who do not wish to become officers** but who have ideas or projects that can benefit the Alliance. This track does **not have multiple numbered ranks**; it is essentially a **prestige status at the E-10 level**, earned by designing a unique contribution.

A member pursuing the Prestige Track will remain an enlisted Master in terms of hierarchy, but can earn a **custom title and role** reflecting their specialized contribution. To do this, the member must propose and complete a **Prestige Project** that goes above and beyond normal activities. Examples of prestige projects include:

- **Designing a new mission or program** for the Alliance. (For instance, creating a Wilderness Search and Rescue training module from scratch, or establishing a Community Outreach initiative that becomes an official Alliance program.)
    
- **Creating a specialized badge or certification**. (For example, developing a “Cyber Preparedness” badge with its own curriculum and requirements, which other members can then earn.)
    
- **Inventing or building advanced gear** that significantly aids preparedness. (For instance, constructing a novel solar-powered HAM radio repeater network for your region, or an open-source emergency planning app for all members.)
    
- **Achieving a notable feat** that brings credit to the Alliance. (For example, publishing a guidebook on disaster prep under FPA’s banner, or leading a major humanitarian relief effort as an FPA representative.)
    

The process to attain a prestige title usually involves first getting the project approved (often by the Board or a committee) and then, upon completion, having the **membership vote to confer the prestige status**. This ensures the project has broad support and recognition. Validation is typically at the highest level (full member ballot or leadership council vote) because a prestige title is a unique honor – in effect, the Alliance is saying “we endorse this member’s custom contribution and allow them to carry a title reflecting it.”

A successful candidate on the prestige track might receive a title like **“Master Instructor – Medical Response”** or **“Alliance Engineer (CWO)”** or any appropriate designation that suits the project. They might also receive a unique badge or emblem signifying their achievement. It’s important to note that prestige titles do **not grant any special authority over others or secret privileges** – they are purely honorary and functional in context of the project. A prestige member is still an E-10 in hierarchy (and would still defer to officers for chain-of-command issues), but is respected as an _acknowledged expert or creative leader_ in their domain.

The Prestige Track is subject to the same transparency as other paths. The project details and progress are usually visible to the community, and the final vote ensures everyone agrees the member earned their prestige. If a prestige project requires ongoing involvement (say running the program they created), the member effectively takes on that responsibility similar to an appointed officer, but focused on their specialized area without going into general command.

In summary, the Prestige Track allows the Alliance to benefit from **innovative and specialized contributions** by its top members who choose not to pursue traditional leadership. It adds flexibility and recognizes that leadership can take many forms – whether it’s leading people (Officer track) or leading ideas and innovation (Prestige track).

## Fairness and Transparency Principles

The FPA rank system is built on fairness and equal access. **No rank, whether Enlisted, Officer, or Prestige, grants special perks or exclusive access to information.** All members, regardless of rank, use the same communication tools, attend the same general training (with advanced options open to all who qualify), and have visibility into the same network resources. Higher rank is viewed as _more responsibility_, not more privilege:

- **No Secret Knowledge or Tools:** There are no secret manuals or exclusive gear reserved for higher ranks. For example, an E-2 has access to the same emergency plan templates and radio frequencies as an E-10. The difference is that an E-10 has more experience using them. All official documents, standard operating procedures, and training materials are open to all members.
    
- **Contribution is Rewarded, Not Power:** Ranks primarily indicate how much a member has contributed to their own preparedness and to the group. For officers, rank indicates the size of the group they’re currently responsible for – not any inherent power over others outside that scope. An officer’s decisions are accountable to those who elected them and to the Alliance’s guidelines.
    
- **Transparent Validation:** The use of peer votes, board reviews, and full-member ballots for validation means the community actively verifies each promotion. This peer oversight prevents any “old boys’ club” or favoritism from unfairly advancing someone. Every member can see _why_ a person was promoted (they can look at the tasks completed and points earned, which are logged) and often had a voice in approving it.
    
- **No Tiered Benefits:** There are no material benefits (like special equipment, monetary rewards, or privileges) that come with rank. Alliance Points and ranks are a form of gamified recognition and a way to qualify members for certain duties (for instance, only someone who reached E-5 and has a radio license can serve as a net control operator in a drill, etc.), but they don’t entitle anyone to things like priority in actual disaster aid or anything of that sort.
    
- **Collaboration Across Ranks:** The Alliance encourages higher and lower ranks to work together. Mentorship is built into the system to avoid cliques – E-8 Mentors work closely with new members, officers rely on enlisted experts in drills, etc. Every member’s input is valued in after-action reviews and planning, regardless of rank. A good idea from an E-1 can be adopted just as readily as one from an E-10.
    
- **Accountability:** With greater rank (especially for officers) comes greater accountability. Officers have term limits or regular re-validation (through elections or reviews). If an officer fails to perform or violates trust, they can be removed by the same mechanism they were appointed. Prestige members proposing projects must deliver results to maintain their status. In essence, the structure prevents anyone from resting on their rank – one must continue contributing to retain the community’s respect.
    

These principles ensure the FPA remains an **alliance of equals working toward a common goal**, with the rank structure serving as a motivator and organizer, not a divider. The ultimate aim is that every member, at whatever rank or role, feels empowered to contribute and improve, and sees the path to do so clearly.

## Rank Structure Summary Table

Below is a summary table of all **20 standard ranks** in the FPA system (Enlisted E-1 to E-10 and Officer O-1 to O-10), along with the **Prestige option** at the E-10 level. For each rank, the table lists the title, the key required tasks/milestones for promotion, the AP floor (minimum cumulative Alliance Points needed), the validation type required, the path/fork, and the two quantitative metrics – AP slope (additional AP required compared to the previous rank) and validation index (level of validation rigor):

|**Rank & Title**|**Required Tasks / Milestones**|**AP Floor**|**Validation Type**|**Path**|**AP Slope**|**Val. Index**|

|**E-10: Master**|- Organize and lead a large-scale/public preparedness drill or event (multi-team or community level)|4500|Board signoff (leadership approval)|Core|+900|3|
|_E-10 Prestige: Custom__“Prestige Member”_|- **Prestige Project:** Design and execute a unique mission, program, badge or gear innovation benefiting the Alliance (requires proposal & completion)- **Custom Title** awarded upon success (e.g. “Master Medic” or “Chief Engineer”)|5000|Full membership vote (to confer prestige title)|Prestige|+500|4|
|**O-1: Team Leader**|- Serve as leader of a local team/squad; coordinate team missions & training|5000|Full vote (peers elect)|Officer|+500|4|
|**O-2: Unit Leader**|- Oversee multiple teams (unit); coordinate joint operations between squads|6000|Peer vote (unit members)|Officer|+1000|2|

|**O-4: District Officer**|- Lead a district (all teams in an area); organize district-wide events|8000|Board signoff (regional board)|Officer|+1000|3|
|**O-5: Regional Officer**|- Command a region’s operations (multi-district); run major regional mission|10000|Board signoff (national board)|Officer|+2000|3|
|**O-6: Regional Director**|- Supervise multiple regions or a very large region; implement national programs locally|12000|Board signoff (national board)|Officer|+2000|3|
|**O-7: National Officer**|- Take national staff role (lead a nationwide program or special mission)|14500|Board signoff (exec board)|Officer|+2500|3|
|**O-8: National Director**|- Oversee multiple national programs/departments; senior national staff|17000|Board signoff (exec board)|Officer|+2500|3|
|**O-9: Deputy Alliance Cmdr**|- Serve as second-in-command of the entire Alliance; lead in absence of Commander|20000|Full membership vote|Officer|+3000|4|
|**O-10: Alliance Commander**|- Serve as overall Alliance leader; set vision, command national missions|23000|Full membership vote|Officer|+3000|4|

**Notes on the Table:** Enlisted ranks (E-1 to E-10) are on the “Core” path required for everyone. After E-10, a member can either remain in core (as a Master, potentially pursuing a Prestige project) or branch into the Officer path if elected. The Prestige track is shown as an _alternative E-10_ achievement – it’s not a numbered rank beyond E-10, but rather a special designation at the Master level for a unique contribution (hence the “E-10 Prestige” row). Officer ranks (O-1 to O-10) are only attained via election/appointment and involve leadership roles of increasing scope.

The **AP Floor** column shows cumulative points needed; the **AP Slope** indicates how much more AP is required compared to the previous rank. You can see the slope increases in general as ranks go up (meaning you need to put in more effort between high ranks than between low ranks). The **Validation Type** and **Validation Index** columns indicate the rigor of approval needed: early ranks are mentor-verified or automatic, while top ranks need board or full membership approval. For example, E-2 Apprentice has validation “Automatic” with index 0 (you pass the quiz, you’re promoted), whereas O-10 Alliance Commander requires a full member vote (index 4).

Finally, **Path** simply denotes whether the rank is part of the Core Enlisted path, the Officer track, or the Prestige option. This makes it clear that Prestige is separate (and only at the E-10 level), and that Officers are on a different fork after the core path. Regardless of path, all members work within the same Alliance and towards the same goals – the pathways just allow for different forms of contribution and leadership.

## Conclusion

The FPA rank structure is both an **achievement roadmap** and a **functional hierarchy** for the Alliance. It motivates members to steadily build their preparedness skills (through the Enlisted ranks), provides opportunities for leadership and greater responsibility (through the Officer ranks), and encourages innovation and personal initiative (through the Prestige track). Every promotion represents real growth – in knowledge, capability, or service – verified by peers and leaders. By design, this system avoids elitism: it ensures that rank is earned through dedication and that those who advance remain accountable to the whole Alliance. With this structure, FPA members can clearly see how to progress and contribute more, all while keeping the playing field level and mission-focused. Together, following this framework, the Alliance cultivates highly skilled individuals and strong leaders who can unite to face any emergency with confidence and cooperation.

Each enlisted rank milestone is explicitly supported and validated through FPA’s core readiness scaffolding tools: [[TERM:OpCheck]], [[TERM:Skill Delta]], [[TERM:Gear Pool]], and the [[TERM:Squad Wheel]]. These tools are embedded across the E-1 to E-10 progression and function as both developmental benchmarks and evaluation instruments.

- **OpCheck** becomes mandatory from **E-3 onward**, providing structured review and validation of readiness, especially in comms (E-3–E-5) and scenario execution (E-6+).
- **Skill Delta** tracking is continuous across all ranks, highlighting member-to-role alignment gaps. Progression through higher E-levels requires not only task completion but also a low Delta relative to peer averages.
- **Gear Pool** thresholds gate rank-specific field scenarios; for instance, **E-6 blackout simulation** requires validated backup gear from the shared pool.
- **Squad Wheel** helps align team formation and leadership drills, becoming central at **E-7 and beyond** where small-team leadership is validated.

Every promotion checkpoint is cross-referenced on the Sync Dashboard under TMP protocols, ensuring version-locked integrity. Readiness reports auto-sync with Squad Leads for members E-5 and higher. This system-wide coupling guarantees that ranks are not symbolic—they reflect lived, demonstrated capability.

> Note: All matrix modifications must route through patch-class edits, retaining structural stability across the FPA Mk1Mod3 governance model.

#### Tool-Based Progression Calibration

FPA Elevation Levels (E1–E10) are not linear promotions, but calibrated transformations. Each rank is anchored in tool-based diagnostics that confirm alignment, capacity, and readiness:

- [[TERM:OpCheck]]: Verifies situational fluency and role-specific action capacity before elevation.
- [[TERM:Skill Delta]]: Surfaces learning gaps and compression thresholds; delta closure is required before tier shift.
- [[TERM:Gear Pool]]: Acts as an unlock map; elevation expands the domain-specific kits and protocols available.
- [[TERM:Squad Wheel]]: Assesses inter-relational roles and team synchronicity, critical for E4+ movements.

These tools are indexed at each tier to avoid premature ascension and prevent static promotion models.

```markdown
| Level | Readiness Signal       | Skill Delta Role         | Gear Pool Access Pattern | Squad Wheel Expectation   |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| E1    | Initial OpCheck pass   | Entry delta                | Seed gear access           | Pair bond only             |
| E3    | Sustained diagnostics  | Multi-skill intro          | Tiered basics              | Light team interaction     |
| E5    | Tactical complexity    | Sub-domain convergence     | Mid-tier unlocks           | Core Squad rotation        |
| E7    | Strategic coherence    | Field-to-org synthesis     | Specialist tools + filters | Full Wheel requirements    |
| E10   | Systemic autonomy      | Cross-org closure          | Full protocol suite        | Squad-to-org resonance     |
```

The Rank Matrix uses these tools not only to measure capacity but to **certify trajectory resilience**. A user must demonstrate upward congruence via instrumented diagnostics before advancement.
