INSTRUCTION FOR GPT REWRITE · FPA Mk1Mod3 · 20. FPA Alignment & Trust Protocols.md

This note is part of a coordinated 21-file rewrite. The system has accumulated inconsistencies in terminology, outdated references, and fragmented logic. Your task is to:

✅ Standardize terminology across the Mk1Mod3 system.
✅ Flag and fix misalignments between sections and related files.
✅ Deeply interlink this note with all other Mk1Mod3 documents using [[Note Name]] format.
✅ Maintain original meaning — but clarify, consolidate, and format for coherence.
✅ DO NOT create new ideas or models — restructure only based on what exists.

Known systemic issues to watch for:
- Terms, role names, or procedures that differ between files and need unification.
- Notes that refer to concepts covered elsewhere without linking or quoting.
- Updates to frameworks or protocols that aren't reflected consistently.
- Lack of clear flow between orientation → training → execution → governance → feedback.

Your rewrite goal:
Lay out methods for maintaining alignment. Fix link fragmentation between trust-building and system execution documents.

Audience:

## FPA Alignment & Trust Protocols

> [[TERM:Trust Doctrine]], [[TERM:Trust Firewall Protocol]], [[TERM:Trust_Firewall]] — This trio defines how values translate to enforcement during operational or interpersonal stress.

The FPA operates on a tiered trust enforcement system:

1. **Trust Doctrine** — Value-based baseline
2. **Trust Firewall** — Quantified or qualified trigger
3. **Trust Firewall Protocol** — Isolates risk, redirects comms, initiates dispute handling

All alignment protocols embed references to the core Canonical Dictionary.

# 20. FPA Alignment & Trust Protocols 🔧

## 🔍 Mission

To codify how trust is earned, protected, and enforced inside the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA). This document defines cultural alignment practices, trust-building procedures, permission transparency, and conflict escalation protocols—from onboarding to leadership audits. It explains how trust is operationalized at every step of the FPA experience so that no ambiguity exists.

## 🔐 Core Doctrine (Why Trust Must Be Engineered)

Trust in FPA is not a feeling—it’s a system. We don’t blindly “believe in the good” of individuals. We verify. Every squad member, leader, and AI output is subject to a chain of checks, documented actions, and transparent reviews. Trust must:

- **Survive blackouts** (continue working with no digital access)
    
- **Scale with growth** (hold up with 5 people or 50,000)
    
- **Repair after failure** (self-audit, fix, and continue under pressure)
    

We treat trust like infrastructure: if it fails, everything collapses. So we build it to military-grade durability.

## 🧭 Alignment Pillars (How We Build Cultural Cohesion)

### 1. Cultural Onboarding (Day 1)

To prevent future problems, we begin with alignment. Every new member completes:

- **Cultural Alignment Form** — Confirms they've read:
    
    - The ethical principles in the [[Compass Guide]]
        
    - The enforcement protocols in the [[Trust Doctrine]]
        
    - Their expected conduct in drills, squads, and communication
        
- **Values Reflection Quiz** — Optional tool that presents real-world scenarios and evaluates how well their instincts match FPA’s values. Scores under 60% flag the member for mentorship, not punishment.
    

### 2. Trust Milestones by Rank (When Trust Becomes Verified)

This table defines how trust is formally “earned” at different levels:

|Milestone|When It Happens|What You Must Do|
|---|---|---|
|**E-1 Trust Confirmed**|When a member first joins|Complete the alignment form and optionally take the Values Quiz|
|**E-3 Field Trust**|After participating in a drill|Submit a gear review + pass a HAM radio check-in with squad|
|**E-5 Strategic Trust**|Before becoming a leader|Pass the Conflict SOP test and hold a Trust Score of 85% or higher|
|**E-7 Legacy Trust**|Squad creator or mentor tier|Must be publicly vetted by at least 3 squad members + show audit logs|

These are not fluff badges. Each stage unlocks new permissions and responsibilities.

## ⚠️ Conflict Resolution Escalation Tree (When Trust Breaks Down)

Conflicts are expected. This tree shows how they are resolved clearly and fairly:

1. **1-on-1 Discussion** – Encourage both members to resolve privately. Use a peer mediator if needed.
    
2. **Squad Review** – Squad votes on the issue. Anonymous comments are allowed. Vote is logged.
    
3. **Regional Panel** – At least one outside squad lead must sit on this panel to prevent bias.
    
4. **National Ethics Call** – For violations involving doctrine, high-level corruption, or system sabotage.
    

**Failsafe:** If any stage fails to take action within **7 days**, any member may activate the [[Trust Firewall System]] — a decentralized auto-audit that forces the issue to be reviewed by a wider oversight group.

---

## 🔎 Trust Metrics & Tracking (How We Know It’s Working)

All trust interactions are logged and tracked through visible metrics:

- **Transparency Index** – Measures what % of leadership roles have visible logs and audits
    
- **Responsiveness Score** – Tracks how quickly squads and leaders respond to reported incidents
    
- **Patch Log Volume** – Records all violations and how fast they were resolved. More is not bad—slow responses are.
    

These scores are viewable to all members ranked E-2 or higher on the [[Trust Dashboard]] in the app and in squad reports.

## 🧾 Role Transparency & Permissions Map (What Each Rank Can See & Do)

|Role|Can View|Can Submit/Edit|Can Override|
|---|---|---|---|
|Guest|Public-facing FPA documents|None|None|
|E-1 to E-2|App data, Squad logs|Activity logs, comments|None|
|E-3 to E-5|Gear logs, peer votes|Gear reviews, squad notes|Peer-based overrides via squad vote|
|E-6 to E-9|Audit trails, leader dashboards|SOP edits (local only)|Regional overrides + flag triggers|
|O-Rank/Coordinator|Full trust/audit interface|SOP + App settings + Training tools|Can trigger Trust Pings + patch rollouts|

> Every override is timestamped and sent to the public Trust Feed within 24 hours. No secret vetoes allowed.

## 🚪 Trust Onboarding Walkthrough (Step-by-Step)

1. **User joins FPA** → Gets alignment form immediately
    
2. **AI evaluates values quiz** → If score <60%, auto-flags for “mentorship watch”
    
3. **User reads Conflict SOP guide** → Signs acknowledgment
    
4. **User joins a squad or is placed in an onboarding pool**
    
5. **After 1 drill** → Peer scores + field test sent to dashboard
    
6. **After 30 days** → Trust Score calculated + member gains visibility into Trust Metrics
    

This isn’t just for admins—members can view their score and challenge any part of it.

## 🧱 Integration Map

- [[Trust Doctrine]] → All audits, safeguards, triggers
    
- [[Compass Guide]] → Values, alignment expectations
    
- [[Conflict Handling & Cultural Resilience]] → Situational breakdowns and response logic
    
- [[FPA App White Paper]] → Where metrics and override flows are seen

## 📌 Final Line:

FPA does not run on vibes. It runs on trust you can verify, challenge, and rebuild. We don’t shame people—we stress-test them. Alignment is a system, and trust is not soft. It’s engineered to survive collapse.

### 🔧 Version Stamp
Version: Mk1Mod3-2025-05-01-1148

> Trust stack ready for consolidation. Apply Trust Doctrine ⇄ Firewall Protocol ⇄ Threshold micro-footer after this point.

### PATCH 2025-05-02 2e5c90

#### Trust Stack Footer (Canonical Addendum)

The Trust Stack Footer defines the immutable baseline for task delegation and elevation verification within FPA operational tiers. This patch inserts it as a codified closing to all trust-calibrated workflows.

```markdown
## 🔒 Trust Stack Footer (Canonical Logic)

- **T0 – Assertion**: Any claim must be grounded in verifiable signal, timestamped, and witnessed (OpCheck).
- **T1 – Reflection**: Squad Wheel check confirms interpersonal load and trust feedback loop.
- **T2 – Validation**: Task routing must pass a Skill Delta fit-check for assigned role. Deviations flagged.
- **T3 – Authorization**: Gear Pool inventory and elevation flags must be synced. Role lock if out-of-bounds.
- **T4 – Confirmation**: TMP or scenario result sync required. Mission clock starts only after confirmation.
- **T5 – Audit Trail**: Sync Dashboard must contain all elevation triggers + witness trail for retro-check.
```

This footer binds TMP-confirmed flows to [[TERM:Trust Doctrine]] and provides a checksum for squad and ops lead validation cycles.
