_The FPA‚Äôs Operational Readiness Doctrine is a dynamic system that ties together individual preparedness, squad coordination, and alliance-wide protocols. It defines clear activation phases, role expectations, and fallback procedures so that when a crisis hits, every member (and even our AI tools) knows exactly what to do. Through regular routines and drills, readiness becomes a measurable habit ‚Äì feeding into trust scores, squad reliability metrics, and leadership decisions ‚Äì ensuring our alliance stays ready for anything._

## 1. Purpose

Readiness isn‚Äôt just a mindset‚Äîit‚Äôs a coordinated **system**. This doctrine outlines how the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) shifts from day-to-day calm into full emergency response during disasters, blackouts, or total grid collapse. The Mk1Mod3 version builds on earlier practices (Mk1Mod2) by hardening our offline-first infrastructure, formalizing a trust-based leadership chain, and cementing squad-synchronized fallback protocols. The goal is that every team knows **what to do, when to do it, and who to follow**‚Äîwithout waiting for orders from above.

## 2. Readiness Framework Overview

FPA‚Äôs operational readiness operates on three integrated components:

- **Operational Readiness Progression (ORP):** A four-phase activation model (Passive, Prepared, Active, System Override) with a scoring engine that tracks each unit‚Äôs status (SOP compliance, communication performance, skill proficiency). The ORP phases are monitored via the FPA app/AI to trigger escalations as conditions worsen (see Section 3).
    
- **Three-Tier Readiness Levels:** Parallel readiness checkpoints at the **Personal**, **Squad**, and **Community/Regional** levels. For example, individual members must maintain personal gear (e.g. go-bag checklists and family plans), squads must verify team readiness (e.g. every member‚Äôs gear and deployment status, comms rehearsals), and communities/regions must secure broader preparedness (e.g. functioning radio networks and fallback rally plans). Each tier‚Äôs readiness contributes to the next ‚Äì if one layer is weak, the whole system is weaker.
    
- **OpCheck (Operational Check):** A final pre-deployment confirmation step. An **OpCheck** is essentially a go/no-go checklist every member or squad must pass before mobilizing for a mission. It confirms all critical readiness items are green-lit (gear packed, comms tested, objectives clear, permissions granted) so that deployments happen only when teams are truly ready.
    

All FPA drills, forms, and protocols use standardized terminology defined in the **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]**, ensuring everyone shares a common language for readiness.

## 3. Operational Readiness Progression (ORP)

**Readiness is defined by phase, not mood.** FPA uses escalating phases of activation to ramp up our posture in a controlled way as a situation deteriorates:

|**Phase**|**Description**|**Trigger Conditions**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Passive Mode**|Ongoing skill-building, routine audits, and low-stakes drills. _Normal preparedness state._|Default day-to-day operations (no active threats).|
|**2. Prepared Mode**|Regular app check-ins, local squad sync-ups, and gear/supply confirmation. _Teams heighten alertness._|Early warning signs (severe weather alerts, fuel shortages, rising tension).|
|**3. Active Readiness**|Field kits staged and ready, radio networks active, rally points reviewed and prepped. _Teams poised to respond._|Imminent crisis in area (disaster within ~100 miles or direct regional threat forecast).|
|**4. System Override**|Full offline SOP stack engaged, AI/app functions paused, and the fallback chain-of-command takes effect. _Teams operate autonomously under pre-set emergency protocols._|Major failure conditions (grid blackout >48 hours, complete communications outage, AI system failure, or widespread civil unrest).|

Each phase comes with specific member expectations, clear escalation paths, and predetermined command fallbacks (e.g. designated backup leaders for when normal leadership is cut off). As the situation moves from Phase¬†1 to¬†4, authority shifts more locally and procedures become more urgent and robust.

**Linked Systems:** The ORP phases tie into many other FPA frameworks. For instance, the [[Compass Guide]] provides ethical and tactical SOPs that teams follow at each phase, the [[Trust Doctrine]] governs how leadership handoffs occur under strain, the _[[SHTF Bible]]_ offers scenario-specific guidance for Phase¬†3/4 situations, and tools like [[Test My Plan]] help members evaluate their readiness during Passive/Prepared phases. All these components reinforce the ORP, creating a holistic readiness ecosystem.

## 4. Emergency Trigger Protocols

Certain events **trigger an immediate shift** into higher readiness modes or even System Override. In Mk1Mod3, our emergency trigger logic is well-defined:

**Triggers:**

- **Grid down** (power outage) for 48+ hours.
    
- **Leadership comms dark** ‚Äì no contact with national or regional leadership (assume top of chain is offline).
    
- **AI failure or lockout** ‚Äì FPA AI systems go unresponsive or their outputs fail trust validation (e.g. trip the Trust Firewall).
    

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Activate Offline SOPs:** Switch to printed emergency protocols (e.g. break out the Compass Guide and local drill manuals).
    
2. **Radio Network Up:** Initiate radio communications nets. Use 7.200¬†MHz HF as the primary ‚Äúall-call‚Äù frequency, with regional VHF channels as fallback.
    
3. **Paper Trust Chain:** Implement the backup leadership chain. Squads confirm their fallback leader using a paper log or signed roster (at least 3 member signatures to validate the new point person).
    
4. **Analog Coordination:** Move all critical logging and coordination to offline methods ‚Äì e.g. switch to paper logs for resource tracking and issue pre-printed task cards for urgent roles.
    

In essence, when these triggers hit, **local squads take charge.** No member waits for permission to protect their area. Coordination continues through alternative means:

- Printed manuals and SOP binders (for guidance when digital tools are down).
    
- Field radios and community bulletin boards (for communication).
    
- Known rally points and pre-planned meetups (for physical coordination).
    

These protocols are decentralized by design ‚Äì they ensure that even if higher command or AI assistance is cut off, each squad knows how to continue operations and can escalate issues through the circle structure as needed (e.g. reaching out to any adjacent regional hub that still has comms).

## 5. Offline Survival Architecture (Resilience Stack)

The FPA is not a digital-only alliance; **every critical system is mirrored offline** to ensure resilience:

|**Core System**|**Offline Mirror**|
|---|---|
|FPA App Dashboard|Wall charts and squad ‚Äútrust booklets‚Äù (printed ledgers of roles/contacts).|
|Test My Plan (AI tool)|Printed skill and gear checklists; _SHTF_ scenario drill maps.|
|Gear Audit (equipment tracking)|Binder inserts and visual inventory cards for physical gear checks.|
|Member Logs (profiles, ranks)|Pen-and-paper rank tracker and trust score logs.|

Each squad maintains an ‚Äú**Offline Activation Kit**‚Äù with essential items to operate in a no-power situation:

- **Printed Compass Guide** (updated quarterly with the latest SOPs and ethical guidelines).
    
- **Hand-crank or solar-powered radio** (or a shielded HAM unit) for communication.
    
- **USB drive with SOP and knowledge base** ‚Äì contains digital copies of all SOPs, the FPA Dictionary, the _SHTF Bible_, and other references, in case a computer is available offline.
    
- **Regional map set** with pre-marked rally points and frequencies (so teams know where to regroup and what channels to use if all else fails).
    

All of these offline tools are kept current. Fallback materials are refreshed during drills and especially in **Prepared Mode (Phase¬†2)** before a crisis hits. This approach is part of FPA‚Äôs broader **[[Offline-First Resilience System]]**, ensuring that even if power and internet fail, every squad can continue to coordinate and access critical information. In short, the alliance can operate in the dark.

## 6. Tiered Operational Kits

Every member is expected to have a field-ready kit appropriate to their role and rank. Kits are standardized in three tiers:

|**Tier**|**Key Contents**|**Member Fit**|
|---|---|---|
|**Tier I (Basic)**|Notebook & pencil, ‚Äúpulse‚Äù schedule card (comm check timetable), basic VHF handheld radio.|Entry-level members (ranks E-1 to E-2).|
|**Tier II (Standard)**|_All Tier I items, plus:_ printed SOP quick sheets, local maps, whistle, multi-tool/knife, and a squad signal plan card.|Core squad members (ranks E-3 to E-5).|
|**Tier III (Advanced)**|_All Tier II items, plus:_ long-range HF radio, encrypted USB with full data backup, full printed Compass Guide, and a solar charger.|Squad leads, senior members (E-6+), and dedicated comm nodes.|

Every squad should have **at least one Tier¬†II or III kit** in good working order at all times. Quarterly drills include a gear inspection to verify these kits are complete and functional. This ensures that when an emergency strikes, the tools needed for communication and coordination are immediately on hand.

## 7. System Override SOP

**When digital goes dark, analog takes over.** The System Override SOP is a step-by-step procedure that squads execute when Phase¬†4 is activated:

1. **Initiate Comm Pulse Check:** The local squad lead kicks off a radio check-in at the designated times (07:00 and 19:00 local) to establish contact with any reachable units.
    
2. **Post Emergency Info:** The squad posts an emergency status chart and any critical SOP pages in a common area (e.g. a community bulletin board, squad safehouse wall, etc.) so that all members can physically see the game plan.
    
3. **Activate Backup Leader:** If the primary leader is out of contact, the pre-designated backup (fallback lead) takes charge, verified via the paper trust chain (e.g. at least 3 squad members sign off on the leadership handover).
    
4. **Deploy Task Cards:** Switch to a manual task assignment system. Hand out printed ‚Äútask cards‚Äù to members, which outline specific duties (patrol area X, check on resource Y, etc.), replacing app-based tasking.
    
5. **Maintain Radio Logs:** Keep a handwritten log of all radio communications (timestamp, call signs, messages sent/received). This creates a record of decisions and intel while systems are down.
    
6. **Daily Data Backup:** Collect all paper logs and reports at end of day for safekeeping. Once systems come back online, these will be entered into the app for archival and analysis.
    

**Radio Network Protocols:** During an override scenario, squads adhere to strict radio habits:

- Use **7.200¬†MHz HF** as the primary ‚Äúpulse‚Äù frequency for wide-area updates (national/regional net).
    
- Use designated **VHF regional channels** as local fallback (each region has a pre-assigned frequency posted on the squad‚Äôs map).
    
- Conduct radio check-ins **hourly on the hour** during total communications blackout (more frequently if needed) to relay any urgent information.
    

Fallback kits include tools to **verify trust and identity** offline. For example, members carry rank booklets or challenge-phrase lists so they can authenticate each other over radio or in person (to prevent impersonation or confusion in the absence of digital verification). By following the System Override steps, squads ensure continuity of command and communication until normal operations can resume.

## 8. Signal & Power Resilience Layers

Even in worst-case failures, FPA has redundancies at every layer. The table below outlines common failure modes and our countermeasures:

|**Failure Scenario**|**FPA Countermeasure**|
|---|---|
|**Power Outage**|Battery backups: hand-crank generators, solar chargers, vehicle inverters to power gear.|
|**Internet Down**|Radio networks fill the gap: HAM and VHF communication, plus printed SOPs for guidance (offline workflow).|
|**App/System Failure**|Pre-printed materials: every team has offline kits and task cards to continue operations without the app.|
|**AI Corruption**|Human override: local squad councils assume decision-making, and any AI guidance is halted until verified (following the [[Trust Doctrine]] protocols).|

In short, for each critical dependency, there‚Äôs a fallback. If one link breaks, another mechanism (human or analog) is in place to keep operations moving safely.

## 9. Required Drills for Rank Validation

All members of rank **E-3 and above** must regularly complete a set of drills to validate their readiness. These are not one-time trainings, but ongoing requirements that ensure skills don‚Äôt atrophy:

- **Dark Drill:** At least 12‚Äì24 hours of operating **using radio-only comms** (no phones or internet). This drill tests everyone‚Äôs ability to coordinate when the grid is down and builds confidence in HAM/VHF usage.
    
- **Print Drill:** A full refresh of offline materials ‚Äì printing out the latest SOPs, checklists, contact lists, etc., and distributing them to the team. This ensures all printed backups are up-to-date and that members practice relying on paper.
    
- **Task Drill:** A simulation where the digital tasking system is turned off. Leaders issue physical task cards and possibly simulate a ‚Äúnode failure‚Äù (e.g. assume the squad lead is unavailable) to practice distributed leadership and adaptability.
    

Drill participation is logged in both the FPA app (when online) and in the squad‚Äôs paper binder. Completing these drills is **mandatory** for maintaining rank status. Members who miss a required drill will be flagged ‚Äì they must complete a makeup drill or undergo re-certification at the squad level before their rank is considered in good standing again. These drills serve as a continuous feedback loop: consistent participation boosts a member‚Äôs trust and competency rating, while lapses prompt corrective training and can hinder one‚Äôs progression.

## 10. Role Simulations

Beyond general drills, every key **role** in the alliance has specific scenario responsibilities. We require periodic simulation of these duties so that individuals can perform their role under stress. Typical role-play scenarios include:

|**Role**|**Must Simulate (Scenario)**|
|---|---|
|**Family Anchor** (household lead)|Use a printed SOP packet to coordinate a small group (e.g. family members), delegating tasks like water storage or first aid to untrained helpers.|
|**Scout** (mobile recon)|Operate with a Tier¬†II kit in the field ‚Äì navigate to a checkpoint, gather intel, and report back via radio (testing endurance and comms under pressure).|
|**Hub Lead** (squad command)|Run scheduled comm pulse checks, manage incoming reports, and assign fallback duties to squad members when normal comms/leadership are disrupted.|

These role simulations are typically carried out quarterly. **Drills are not optional** ‚Äì they are built into our rank advancement criteria. If a member in one of these roles fails to participate in their simulation drills, it will halt their progression and trigger a review. Missed or poorly executed simulations require that the person re-train and be re-evaluated by their squad before their leadership role or rank is fully upheld. This way, titles and trust have to be continuously earned through practice.

## 11. Squad Resilience Scorecard

Each squad maintains a **quarterly readiness scorecard** that is visible to regional leadership. This scorecard provides a snapshot of that squad‚Äôs overall preparedness:

|**Metric**|**Goal**|
|---|---|
|Tier¬†II Kits Functional|100% (all members have necessary gear)|
|Last 3 Drills Completed|Yes (no mandatory drill missed)|
|SOP Wall Updated|Yes (physical SOP/info board is current)|
|90-Day Radio Check (comms)|Yes (at least one radio contact made in last 90 days)|

These scores are more than just stats ‚Äì they directly feed into decision-making:

- They help **prioritize regional resources** and support. For example, a squad that is lagging in any area might receive extra training sessions or equipment from regional coordinators. High-performing squads might be given priority in new pilot programs, etc.
    
- They **influence leadership opportunities.** A consistently high squad readiness score reflects well on that squad‚Äôs lead and members, marking them as reliable and potentially eligible for greater responsibilities. (Conversely, chronic low scores might bar a squad leader from promotion until issues are fixed.)
    
- They **trigger audits if lagging.** If a squad‚Äôs scorecard shows problems (e.g. missing drills, low equipment readiness), the ops council will initiate a squad audit or intervention. This could mean sending a training team to assist, or in serious cases, temporarily rotating in experienced members to help the squad get back on track.
    

In short, the scorecard is both a **health check** and an **accountability tool**. It creates a feedback loop between squads and the broader alliance: squads are motivated to keep their metrics green, and regional leaders (circle leads) can quickly spot where to focus attention.

## 12. Interlinked Infrastructure

The Operational Readiness Doctrine does not stand alone ‚Äì it‚Äôs woven into the FPA‚Äôs broader ecosystem of guides and systems. Key linkages include:

- **[[Compass Guide]]** ‚Äì The FPA‚Äôs ethical and decision-making framework. It defines what actions are acceptable and prioritized at each readiness phase (especially important when squads must make independent calls under pressure). _It provides the moral and tactical ‚Äúcompass‚Äù during operations._
    
- **_[[SHTF Bible]]_** ‚Äì A compendium of scenario plans and survival knowledge. It offers print-ready pages and checklists per region, which squads use during drills and emergencies (e.g. wildfire-specific guidance for West Coast squads). This ensures regional context is factored into readiness.
    
- **[[Trust Doctrine]]** ‚Äì Our alliance‚Äôs trust and governance framework. It ensures that any **fallback leaders** or autonomous squad actions under System Override are backed by a history of trust and vetting. (For example, the doctrine might specify that the person stepping up as backup lead has a certain trust rank or endorsements on record.) It connects readiness with our accountability systems.
    
- **[[Offline-First Resilience System]]** ‚Äì The overarching strategy that underpins all offline mirrors and backups. The readiness drills and offline kit practices in this doctrine are a direct application of the offline-first principles, validating that we can function without cloud support. This system double-checks that our ‚Äúplan B‚Äù (and C) actually works in practice.
    
- **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]** ‚Äì The central glossary of FPA terminology and protocols. All the terms like ORP phases, Comm Pulse Check, OpCheck, etc., are defined consistently in the dictionary. This ensures that when different squads or AI tools refer to a term, everyone interprets it the same way. It‚Äôs a subtle but crucial part of keeping the whole system aligned.
    

By design, improvements or changes in one document (say, the Compass Guide or Trust Doctrine) propagate into the Operational Readiness Doctrine through these links, keeping everything synchronized and up-to-date in the Mk1Mod3 ecosystem.

## 13. Final Word

Readiness is a test we quietly take every day, without knowing when the real exam will come. The FPA doesn‚Äôt build **theoretical** strength‚Äîwe relentlessly train for failure so that we can **function under fire**.

If power dies, _you don‚Äôt wait._

**You activate.**

If leadership is silent, _you don‚Äôt stall._

**You rotate.**

We simulate system collapse because that‚Äôs the price of real preparedness. The Operational Readiness Doctrine ensures that when the signal drops, your training rises to the occasion.
