--># Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) Phased Development Plan – Strategic Roadmap (Mk1Mod3)

## Introduction

The Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) Phased Development Plan (Mk1Mod3) is a strategic roadmap outlining **three critical phases** of growth for our grassroots emergency preparedness network. It serves as a **“living document,”** meant to be updated as we learn from real events and member feedback. This roadmap doesn’t replace the _FPA Dictionary_ or _Compass Guide_ – instead, it complements them by translating FPA’s principles into an actionable timeline. (For definitions of FPA-specific terms, see the FPA Dictionary rather than duplicating those explanations here.) The focus is on blunt, **practical action steps** rather than abstract theory. Members will find clear goals, measurable milestones, and no-nonsense guidance in an “honest coach” tone – expect direct instructions and realistic assessments, not motivational fluff.

**Roadmap Structure:** The plan is divided into **Phase 1: Individual Preparedness**, **Phase 2: Local Squad Formation**, and **Phase 3: National/Global Network**. Each phase builds on the previous, scaling from personal readiness to community teams to a federated network that can operate nationally (and eventually globally). In each phase overview, we summarize goals, then list specific milestones (with numbering like _Phase X.Y_ for easy reference). For each milestone, we provide real-world examples or plausible scenarios illustrating it in action, **lessons learned** from past drills or disasters, a checklist of **Action Steps** (with low-cost options highlighted), and a **Contingency Plan** addressing what to do if things go wrong. This structure ensures that at every level – from a single parent preparing their home, to a neighborhood volunteer squad, to the entire alliance – we maintain aggressive realism, decentralization over central control, transparency over bureaucracy, and member empowerment over admin control.

**Accessibility and Fairness:** A core tenet of FPA is that preparedness shouldn’t be a luxury. This roadmap emphasizes **low-cost or free solutions** so that low-income members can participate fully. (Research shows cost is a major barrier – lower-income households take fewer high-cost preparedness actions but will take just as many low/no-cost steps if given the chance ([Are Americans Prepared for Disasters? FEMA’s Survey Reveals Key Findings - Risk and Resilience Hub](https://www.riskandresiliencehub.com/are-americans-prepared-for-disasters-femas-survey-reveals-key-findings/#:~:text=5,disadvantaged)).) Throughout the plan, wherever expensive gear or training might be mentioned, we include cheaper alternatives or free resources. For example, we point members to free Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) courses or DIY projects instead of pushing fancy equipment. The goal is to close the preparedness gap by **democratizing survival skills**. No member should feel excluded due to finances; resourcefulness and commitment matter more than money in FPA’s approach.

**Living Document:** “Mk1Mod3” indicates this is the Mark 1, Module 3 version – in plain terms, the third major update to our first edition. We will continue to update this roadmap as new technologies emerge (for instance, improvements in off-grid communication or AI planning tools) and as we gather results from pilot programs and drills. It’s a living document that will evolve with input from the community. Members are encouraged to provide feedback via the FPA app or at annual meet-ups. All updates will maintain the roadmap’s blunt, **pragmatic tone** – if something isn’t working, we’ll say so and adjust. Transparency is paramount: all members will know what the plan is, what changes are made, and why.

**Relationship to Other FPA Guides:** Think of the _Compass Guide_ as teaching you **how to navigate** daily preparedness decisions and the _FPA Dictionary_ as defining our **common language**. This Strategic Roadmap is the **action plan** – it tells us **what to do, by when**, to build out the FPA vision in stages. For example, the Compass Guide might explain _why_ HAM radio is important and how to use one, but the Roadmap will set a milestone like “Phase 1.1: Train 100 members in HAM radio by Q2 2025” to ensure we actually achieve radio coverage. The Roadmap won’t repeat definitions or philosophical discussions found elsewhere; instead, it focuses on measurable progress and coordination. Use the Dictionary to look up terms (like “Outernet” or “Trust Doctrine”) and the Compass for general best practices – use this Roadmap to **get things done** step by step.

Finally, a note to all members: This plan is ambitious – roughly 15,000 words of frank instructions – because the stakes are high. Natural disasters, grid failures, and societal crises don’t wait for us to get ready. FPA’s community is growing because we acknowledge a hard truth: **help is not guaranteed** in the first critical days of an emergency. We must help ourselves and each other. By following this phased plan, starting with your own household and scaling up to a nationwide alliance, you are taking ownership of that reality. The tone may be blunt at times, but it’s rooted in respect – we believe every member, regardless of income or background, can contribute meaningfully. **Practical preparedness is the great equalizer.** Whether you’re a tech-savvy urban dweller or a single parent in a rural town, this roadmap provides a clear path for you to build resilience without breaking the bank. Let’s get to work.

## Phase 1: Individual Preparedness

**Overview:** Phase 1 focuses on fortifying each member’s personal preparedness. The goal is **to turn every individual into a reliable first responder for themselves and their family.** In blunt terms, before you can help anyone else, you need your own oxygen mask on. This phase establishes the foundation: emergency plans, basic supplies, personal skills (like first aid and communications), and familiarity with FPA tools. We emphasize **self-reliance** _and_ smart use of technology – for example, using the FPA’s AI planning tools to refine your emergency plan, but also having analog backups in case the power is out. By the end of Phase 1, an FPA member should be **capable of surviving at least two weeks completely off-grid** and communicating with the outside world without the internet or cell network. Phase 1 is also about mindset: brutally honest self-assessment and improvement. Members will learn to identify their own plan’s weak points (through “Test My Plan” drills) and fix them proactively. This phase instills the habit of **continuous preparedness improvement**, which will carry into Phases 2 and 3.

Each milestone in Phase 1 is concrete and measurable – no vague “be better prepared” statements. We’re talking numbers and deadlines, like a target count of members completing a training by a certain date. This creates accountability. We include real examples (e.g., a ham radio saving a family during a hurricane) to drive home _why_ each milestone matters. And since many individuals tend to overestimate their preparedness (FEMA’s 2023 survey found over half of Americans feel prepared, yet only 12% have ever practiced plans with neighbors ([Are Americans Prepared for Disasters? FEMA’s Survey Reveals Key Findings - Risk and Resilience Hub](https://www.riskandresiliencehub.com/are-americans-prepared-for-disasters-femas-survey-reveals-key-findings/#:~:text=three%20or%20more%20actions%20to,disaster%20within%20the%20last%20year))), we’ll share lessons learned from actual disasters that expose common blind spots. **Action Steps** at this phase are mostly things you can do with little or no money: knowledge, training, networking, and low-cost gear hacks. By design, these steps are accessible to someone on a tight budget or with limited time. Finally, we end Phase 1 with a **Contingency Plan** section addressing what to do if personal preparedness efforts hit obstacles – for example, if you can’t afford a piece of gear or if FPA’s app is temporarily down, we have a workaround. In short, Phase 1 builds resilient individuals who form the bedrock of the Alliance. Here are the key milestones:

### Milestones

**Phase 1.1: Train 100 members in HAM radio licensing by Q2 2025.**  
_Real-world example:_ In the aftermath of a hurricane, when phone lines and cell towers are dead, a licensed amateur radio operator in our network can be the lifeline. During the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, CA, emergency warnings failed to reach many residents because **cell towers and power lines were knocked out** – tragically over 80 people died, in part due to lack of timely evacuation alerts ([Ham Radio Operators Help Save Lives | West Sacramento News-Ledger](https://www.westsacramentonewsledger.com/2022/07/06/459716/ham-radio-operators-help-save-lives#:~:text=Merritt%20says%20wildfires%20that%20have,killed%20more%20than%2080%20people)). A HAM radio operator with a simple battery-powered transmitter could have bridged that gap. For instance, one FPA member in Florida used her HAM radio to relay an evacuation order to neighbors during a sudden wildfire when nothing else worked (a scenario we encourage members to emulate). These examples show that **radio skills save lives** when modern tech goes dark.

_Lessons learned:_ Simply having a radio isn’t enough; **training and practice** are crucial. Many people buy a cheap radio and never learn to properly use it or get licensed. Past drills revealed that about half of new members with radios hadn’t even figured out how to tune to local emergency frequencies – a potentially fatal oversight. Lesson: we must train and test. Another lesson from volunteer responders is to coordinate with officials _ahead of time_. Some HAM volunteers who self-deployed during Hurricane Katrina were initially turned away by authorities ([Reality check on emergency communications : r/amateurradio - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/wdwevp/reality_check_on_emergency_communications/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,a%20ham%20for%2028)) because they weren’t integrated into the response network. The fix is to get licensed, join local amateur radio emergency groups (like ARES/RACES), and practice in nets regularly so when a crisis hits, you’re a known quantity. FPA’s approach is to produce operators who are **competent and credentialed** – no loose cannons with radios. We also emphasize **EMP-proofing** your comms (see Phase 1.5) so your gear survives solar flares or worse.

**Action Steps:**

- **Study and get licensed:** Use free resources to prepare for the FCC Amateur Radio Technician exam. (For example, HamStudy.org offers free practice tests, and many local radio clubs host free classes.) Book your exam – often $15 or less – and aim to pass within the next 3-6 months. _Low-cost tip:_ ARRL offers free study guides online, and libraries often have license manuals.
    
- **Acquire a basic HAM radio:** Start with an inexpensive but functional handheld transceiver (e.g. the Baofeng UV-5R, often <$30). These can hit local repeaters and NOAA weather frequencies. _Note:_ Owning one without a license is legal, but transmitting isn’t – so get that license. Meanwhile, you can listen in.
    
- **Join a local net:** After licensing, join a weekly local HAM net (often run by HAM clubs or emergency comm groups). This gets you comfortable with on-air protocol. Many areas have emergency nets you can join at no cost beyond your time. Check into at least one net per week to build skill.
    
- **Set aside time for Field Day:** Attend the annual ARRL Field Day or similar exercises in your area. It’s free and open to the public. You’ll get hands-on experience operating in simulated emergency conditions and meet experienced operators. (_Bonus:_ You might make contacts who can help in real emergencies.)
    
- **Coordinate with FPA comms team:** Register your call sign with FPA’s internal directory (via the app or offline form) so we know who can operate radios. If you don’t want to share your name, just share call sign and general location. This helps in Phase 3 when establishing a national communications tree.
    
- **Practice emergency scenarios:** Don’t just chat about hobby topics – practice using your radio for specific tasks. For example, on your next solo drill weekend, simulate that phones are down and use your HAM radio to call into a preparedness net or another FPA member to report your status. This builds real confidence under pressure.
    

**Phase 1.2: Ensure 100% of members complete a Personal Emergency Plan review (“Test My Plan”) by Q4 2024.**  
_Real-world example:_ Imagine a family who thought they were prepared: they had some food, a generator, and an evacuation plan to drive to Aunt Sue’s house. Then a real flood hit. In the chaos, they discovered the generator was out of fuel, their evacuation route was underwater, and they had never arranged a backup place to stay. Such failures are common when plans aren’t stress-tested. To prevent this, FPA created the **“Test My Plan”** initiative – essentially a guided dry-run of your personal emergency plan. One member in Oregon did a 48-hour off-grid test during a winter storm; he found that his backup heat source wasn’t sufficient below freezing. Thanks to the test, he rectified that (got extra propane and blankets) _before_ a real blizzard hit. The goal is for every member to uncover and fix weaknesses in their plan now, rather than during an actual disaster.

_Lessons learned:_ A consistent lesson from both drills and disasters is **“your plan is only as good as the last time you drilled it.”** People often overestimate what they can do under stress. For instance, during a 2022 FPA-wide “Grid Down Weekend” drill, we learned that **60% of participants ran out of either water or food by day 3** (despite many thinking they had a week’s supply). Plans also tend to overlook contingencies: what if your primary evacuation road is impassable, or what if an injury or illness strikes in the middle of a crisis? The Test My Plan tool – supported by our FPAi Chatbot – systematically throws common failure points at you (e.g., “What if your car won’t start? What if the emergency happens at night when your family is separated?”). **Lesson:** Taking this seriously saves lives. As blunt truth, **a plan untested is barely a plan.** We’ve also learned to incorporate neighbors or family into these tests: one member discovered his family had very different ideas of what to do in a fire. That hard conversation only happened because the structured review forced it. Going forward, every member needs to treat their personal plan as a living document too – updating it annually or after any major life change.

**Action Steps:**

- **Draft your emergency plan:** If you haven’t already, write down your plan covering key scenarios (fire, flood, blackout, etc.). Include: evacuation routes (multiple), emergency contacts, meeting points, and resource inventory (what supplies you have and need). Use the _Compass Guide_ templates or Ready.gov checklists as a starting point. This doesn’t need to be fancy – even bullet points on one page is fine – but it must be written.
    
- **Run “Test My Plan” via FPAi:** Access the _Test My Plan_ feature on the FPA app or website (or via the FPAi Chatbot). It will ask you detailed questions about your plan. Answer honestly. The AI will then simulate a disaster (“Let’s say a 7.0 earthquake hits at 2 AM…”) and walk you through your response step by step, pointing out failures or gaps. Take notes on any weaknesses it finds. If you lack internet or the app, use the printed questionnaire from the _Offline System_ manual – same idea, on paper.
    
- **Plug the holes:** For each gap identified, create a task to address it. If the simulation revealed you don’t have a backup water source, put “buy water storage containers” or “learn water purification (free methods)” on your to-do list. If it found you have no communications plan when separated, establish an out-of-state contact or meeting point. Treat this like a checklist to fix.
    
- **Do a physical drill:** Don’t stop at the Q&A. Physically simulate at least one scenario a year. For example, one weekend, turn off your power and water for 48 hours. Practice using your supplies, and see what breaks first. (Does your family know how to deploy the generator? Can you actually cook on that camp stove?) Use our FPA Drill Guide for a step-by-step script if needed. This will reveal things the Q&A might miss (like the fact that your flashlight batteries are all dead – a common surprise).
    
- **Update your plan & share key points:** Incorporate all improvements into your written plan. Then, **communicate your plan** to those who need to know – family members, a trusted friend, or your FPA mentor (see Phase 1.6). At minimum, someone outside your household should have a copy of your emergency contact list and know your general plan (in case you go missing, they can inform rescuers).
    
- **Leverage FPAi for what-ifs:** Use the FPAi Chatbot to ask “what if” questions anytime you’re unsure. For example, “What if my primary evacuation is blocked?” Our AI is trained on the FPA knowledge base and can suggest alternatives (with the caveat that tech might be down in a real event, so use it now while you can). Always double-check critical advice with a human expert or trusted source if possible.
    

**Phase 1.3: Achieve basic survival provisioning for all members – at least a 14-day supply of essentials by Q4 2025.**  
_Real-world example:_ In numerous disasters (from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to the Texas deep freeze of 2021), it’s clear that outside help might not arrive for **days or even weeks**. In Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, entire communities were on their own for over two weeks with no power and scant supplies. Every FPA member must be able to sustain themselves and their household for a minimum of 14 days without resupply. A tangible example: during the 2017 California wildfires, one FPA member’s home was cut off by road closures. Thanks to her **2-week stockpile** of food, water, and medicine, her family was safe and even helped a neighbor who hadn’t prepared. In contrast, we saw what happened to thousands of unprepared families in the COVID-19 lockdowns – panic buying, empty shelves – those with a pre-stocked pantry avoided that chaos entirely. The aim is that when crisis hits, _no FPA member is standing in FEMA’s food line on day 3; we take care of our own needs and can even assist others._

_Lessons learned:_ It’s not just about having stuff, it’s about having the _right stuff and knowing how to use it_. A common mistake is focusing on flashy gear while neglecting basics like water and medications. After a regional blackout drill, we found many members had multiple tactical flashlights but **not enough drinking water** stored. Lesson: prioritize ruthlessly – water, food, warmth, and medicine come first. Another lesson: **rotation and maintenance.** Stockpiles aren’t “set and forget.” People have opened their bug-out bags in a real emergency only to find spoiled food or leaky batteries. We emphasize low-cost approaches to maintenance: for example, calendar reminders to rotate water every 6 months (it’s free, just labor) or using up stored pantry food in normal times before expiration and replacing it. Also, _skills_ are part of provisioning – knowing how to purify water or cook off-grid can extend limited supplies. A past FPA drill revealed that few members knew how to safely run a generator or even a charcoal grill indoors (which you should **never** do due to carbon monoxide). So, we learned to pair supplies with training (e.g., having a camp stove + practicing using it outdoors). Lastly, feedback from low-income members taught us that building a 14-day supply is doable on a budget by gradually **incremental prepping** – e.g., each grocery trip buy a couple of extra cans. The lesson: consistency beats splurging. Five dollars a week towards your kit adds up.

**Action Steps:**

- **Secure water supply (2 weeks/person):** Store at least 14 gallons _per person_ (1 gal per day for drinking and minimal sanitation). This can be as simple as cleaned repurposed soda bottles filled with tap water (practically free). If you have space, consider a 55-gallon drum (~~$80) or a couple of the 7-gallon BPA-free jugs (~~$15 each). _Low-cost option:_ If money is tight, focus on water purification: acquire unscented bleach or water purification tablets (just a few dollars) and know how to use them. And don’t forget a cheap water filter (even a $20 Sawyer Mini) to refill from natural sources if available. Mark your calendar to rotate stored water every 6-12 months (set a phone reminder or sticker on the container).
    
- **Stockpile non-perishable food (2 weeks/person):** Aim for at least 1,500–2,000 calories per person per day. Prioritize foods that don’t require refrigeration or much cooking: rice, beans, pasta, canned vegetables and meats, peanut butter, oats, etc. _Budget tip:_ You can achieve this gradually – each supermarket visit, grab a couple of extra canned goods or a bag of rice. Dollar stores can be surprisingly good for canned food deals. Store what you eat and eat what you store: cycle through these in daily use to keep it fresh. Ensure you have a manual can opener (cost ~$5) accessible.
    
- **Medicine and first aid:** If you or family members rely on prescription meds, try to maintain a small emergency reserve (even 3-7 days extra can be lifesaving – ask your doctor for a 90-day prescription or use mail-order which often gives a buffer). Keep a stocked first aid kit and include common OTC meds (pain relievers, anti-diarrheals, etc.). Many items can be acquired cheaply at generic brands. Check kits every 6 months for expired items.
    
- **Emergency power & light:** At minimum, have a way to light your home and charge basic devices. Flashlights and headlamps with spare batteries are non-negotiable. You can get decent LED flashlights for $5; get a few. Store batteries in a cool, dry place (and consider a small solar charger or hand-crank flashlight/radio to reduce dependency on batteries). If you can afford, a small solar panel and battery bank (many kits under $100) can keep phones, radios, or medical devices running; otherwise, focus on battery-operated solutions. Candles and kerosene lamps are old-school options but come with fire risk – use with caution and never leave unattended.
    
- **Shelter and warmth:** Evaluate your region and season. Do you need a way to keep warm if heating fails? For cold climates, store extra blankets, sleeping bags (rated for freezing temps if possible), and safe indoor heating options (e.g., a Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater, ~$80, with proper ventilation). In hot climates, focus on cooling and hydration – have a battery-operated fan, and knowledge of cooling techniques (like hanging wet sheets). If your home might become uninhabitable, have basic shelter in your go-bag (tents, tarps, etc., which can be inexpensive or even thrifted).
    
- **Hygiene and sanitation:** Don’t overlook sanitation. Store extra toiletries: toilet paper, feminine products, soap, trash bags (can double as toilet liners or rain ponchos), and bleach for disinfecting. A five-gallon bucket with a lid can serve as an emergency toilet (line with garbage bag and use a bit of cat litter if available to reduce smell). These items are cheap now, priceless later.
    
- **Personalize your kit:** Add items based on personal needs – baby formula, pet food, eyeglasses, hearing aid batteries, etc. Use the FPAi Chatbot or Compass Guide’s checklist to brainstorm items you might forget. Make a checklist and slowly acquire these as means allow. Many things can be sourced second-hand or via community swaps (the FPA app has a section where members give away extra gear locally – take advantage).
    
- **Store safely and accessibly:** Once you have your 14-day cache, store it smartly. Water in durable containers (avoid flimsy plastic that can leak), food in rodent-proof bins if in garage, etc. Spread out the cache if possible (some in pantry, some hidden) in case part of your home is destroyed. Most importantly, ensure everyone in the household knows where these supplies are. It’s useless if only mom knows and she’s not home when disaster hits.
    
- **Maintain and refresh:** Schedule regular maintenance days (at least twice a year, say every daylight savings change or every April and October) to check on your supplies. Rotate any food nearing expiration into your regular meals (replace it on next store trip). Test flashlights and generators. This discipline separates the truly prepared from the hoarder who discovers too late that half his stock is spoiled.
    

**Phase 1.4: Train at least 50 members in basic first aid and CERT by Q4 2025.**  
_Real-world example:_ When disaster strikes, the first person to aid an injured family member or neighbor will likely be _you_, not a paramedic. In a major crisis, 911 may be overloaded or unreachable. For instance, in the minutes after a tornado hit a community in Oklahoma, an FPA member with recent CERT training triaged and treated three injured neighbors before ambulances arrived 45 minutes later. Those neighbors later credited that immediate help with preventing worse outcomes. Community Emergency Response Team (_CERT_) training is a national program (often free) that teaches regular people how to perform light search and rescue, basic medical care, and safety assessment in disasters. Another case: during a local drill, an FPA member learned how to properly use a tourniquet and then used that knowledge in a real car accident scene months later, likely saving a life. The milestone isn’t just about certificates; it’s about **practical lifesaving skills** in the hands of our members. We target 50 members as a start, focusing on regions prone to disasters, but ultimately want every member to have at least basic first aid competence.

_Lessons learned:_ Many folks assume that calling for help is a plan – it isn’t if help can’t come. We learned from events like Hurricane Katrina and recent earthquakes that **ordinary citizens are the true “first responders” in the golden hour**. Thus, a key lesson: **every member should be at least a little bit of a medic.** Also, from past training sessions, we’ve learned that hands-on practice is critical. Reading about CPR is not the same as doing CPR on a dummy. We strongly push members to get in-person training (through CERT, Red Cross, etc.) where possible. Another lesson: leverage free training opportunities. We found that many communities offer free CERT training (20-hour course) and even throw in a free response kit (hard hat, vest, basic tools) ([Be a part of your local Community Emergency Response Team ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1ay2srt/be_a_part_of_your_local_community_emergency/#:~:text=,few%20hundred%20dollars%20of%20gear)). One member in Texas reported: _“They gave me free training on CPR, Stop-the-Bleed, and more. I even got a free CERT backpack with gear.”_ ([Be a part of your local Community Emergency Response Team ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1ay2srt/be_a_part_of_your_local_community_emergency/#:~:text=,few%20hundred%20dollars%20of%20gear)). We should take full advantage of these – it’s a huge boost especially for those who can’t afford expensive private courses. Additionally, our early FPA workshops revealed that people are squeamish or anxious about medical tasks. The frank lesson: **Get over it now.** It’s better to be uncomfortable in a class than frozen in fear when someone’s bleeding in front of you. Post-drill surveys also taught us the value of cross-training: not just one “medic” in the family or squad, but everyone knowing the basics, because the medic could be the one hurt. We carry that forward: no bystanders in training – everyone participates.

**Action Steps:**

- **Enroll in a CERT course:** Find your local CERT program (start at FEMA’s website or ask local fire department). CERT Basic Training is usually ~20 hours total, often spread over a few evenings or a weekend, and **typically free**. Sign up and complete the course. It covers disaster medical ops, fire suppression, search & rescue, and team organization. If CERT isn’t available, at least take a Red Cross First Aid/CPR class (many Red Cross chapters do low-cost or free training days).
    
- **Practice “Stop the Bleed” and CPR:** These are two critical skills for trauma. Many areas offer _Stop the Bleed_ classes (often free at hospitals) where you learn to apply tourniquets and pack wounds. CPR classes might cost a bit (~$50 for certification) but check for community-sponsored sessions (sometimes free for volunteers or students). At minimum, watch free instructional videos from reputable sources and practice on a pillow or dummy if you can. The goal is that you can handle heavy bleeding and cardiac arrest – top killers in disasters.
    
- **Build a first aid kit (budget-friendly):** Assemble a personal first aid kit if you haven’t. It doesn’t need to be a $200 pre-made bag. Use a tackle box or Tupperware and include basics: bandages, gauze, adhesive tape, antiseptic, scissors, tweezers, gloves, pain relievers, etc. Many items can be bought at dollar stores or in bulk and split. Reference the FPA Compass Guide or Red Cross checklist for contents. After training, add advanced items you’re trained to use (e.g., tourniquet, chest seal) – and label them if others might use your kit.
    
- **Home emergency drill with first aid:** Incorporate first aid into your home drills. Example: during a family drill, pretend someone sprains an ankle while evacuating or gets a “bleeding” cut (use moulage or red marker for effect). Practice the treatment steps: cleaning a wound, wrapping a sprain, etc. This not only reinforces your skills but also normalizes taking action despite a little chaos.
    
- **Leverage FPA mentorship:** If you’ve completed training, volunteer to share that knowledge. Host a short skill-share at an FPA meet-up or in the app forums. Conversely, if you can’t attend formal training, link up with a fellow member who did – maybe they can show you some basics one-on-one. Peer training is better than none.
    
- **Keep training materials offline:** Download or print key reference sheets (FPA’s “quick first aid tips,” FEMA’s medical ops cheat-sheet, etc.) and include in your emergency binder. When an emergency happens, stress is high; having a reference to jog your memory is invaluable, especially for procedures you don’t do often. (Example: the CERT cribbing technique for lifting debris might be hard to recall cold – a diagram in your go-bag helps.)
    
- **Update certifications as needed:** Mark your calendar for refreshers (CPR certs often expire in 2 years). Also, stay alert for advanced training opportunities: if a free weekend wilderness first aid course pops up and you have time, take it. Phase 1 is about basics, but nothing stops you from exceeding the milestone.
    

**Phase 1.5: Establish personal emergency communications and backups (Outernet/Radio) for all members by Q2 2025.**  
_Real-world example:_ When the power grid fails and internet and phone networks collapse, information becomes as vital as food and water. A classic example is after Hurricane Maria (2017) in Puerto Rico: residents were cut off from news for days. In one town, an amateur radio operator with a battery-powered setup became the sole source of outside info, relaying messages to and from San Juan. Today, technology offers new options: devices like **Outernet** receivers can pull down data from satellites without needing ground internet. Picture this: a member in a remote area has an Outernet mini-receiver (about the size of a book) – after a cyber-attack takes out the grid, she still receives essential news and FPA updates broadcast via satellite, all on a small battery-powered device. Meanwhile, her neighbor who didn’t invest in such backup is completely in the dark. Another example: during a regional blackout, one FPA family used a hand-crank radio to get NOAA weather alerts about an incoming storm, buying them critical preparation time. The milestone here is to ensure every member has **two-way or one-way emergency communication means beyond standard internet/phone**: at least one method to **receive information** (like a NOAA radio or Outernet feed) and one method to **send out a distress call** (like HAM radio or even a whistle/signal mirror as last resort). And for high-priority members in the network, we aim to pilot advanced tech like satellite messengers or blockchain-based messaging that can work offline.

_Lessons learned:_ Information starvation can be deadly. One lesson from multiple disasters is that rumors and lack of info cause panic. During the 2003 Northeast blackout, people without radios were flying blind with no idea how long it would last or how widespread it was. FPA’s lesson: **every member should never be completely cut off.** We must have redundant communication. We’ve learned to categorize comms into tiers: (1) **Local alerts:** like smoke detectors, local weather radio – immediate life threats; (2) **Outside news:** regional/national info via radio or satellite; (3) **Personal outbound:** ability to call for help or at least send a message to someone. Depending on budget, solutions vary. We learned from members that cheap options exist: a $20 NOAA weather radio can literally save your life with a timely tornado warning. On the high end, some members use satellite communicators (e.g., Garmin InReach) to text when absolutely everything else is down. Not everyone can afford that, so we focus on the basics first. Another key lesson: **EMP protection.** An electromagnetic pulse (from a solar flare or nuke) could fry electronics. It’s rare but possible. We take it seriously because it aligns with worst-case prepping. The lesson: keep at least some gear in a Faraday cage or buy devices with minimal electronics. For example, a simple analog crank radio or old-school CB might survive an EMP better than a modern smartphone. We also ran tests: one member built a DIY Faraday box from foil and cardboard and managed to shield a handheld radio successfully (verified by signal tests) ([EMP Protection for the Radio Amateur, an Encore. - Off Grid Ham](https://offgridham.com/2018/02/emp-encore/#:~:text=Charles%E2%80%99%20testing%20demonstrates%20that%20the,as%20one%20of%20the%20layers)) ([EMP Protection for the Radio Amateur, an Encore. - Off Grid Ham](https://offgridham.com/2018/02/emp-encore/#:~:text=Charles%E2%80%99%20home,HAM%20READER%20SUBMITTED%20PHOTO%20%C2%A92016)). So we propagate that knowledge – EMP-proofing doesn’t have to be expensive (just meticulous). Finally, through drills we saw that people forget to plan for power for their comm devices. Lesson: all the radios in the world won’t help if your batteries are dead and you can’t recharge. So part of this milestone is ensuring off-grid power for comms (even if just a stash of extra batteries or a small solar panel).

**Action Steps:**

- **Obtain a NOAA weather radio:** This is perhaps the simplest, most vital one-way info source for local emergencies. These radios broadcast 24/7 weather and emergency alerts (NWS). Many models are under $30, some with hand-crank and solar charging. Get one and keep it in your home. Program it for your county’s alerts (instructions included usually). Keep it powered (fresh batteries or plugged in with battery backup). This will alert you to things like tornadoes, chemical spills, etc., even if your phone is off or networks are down.
    
- **Set up Outernet (satellite data) if feasible:** FPA is piloting the use of **Othernet/Outernet** receivers. These small devices can receive news, weather, and even curated web content (like Wikipedia snippets or FPA updates) via satellite broadcast, no internet needed ( [Othernet](https://othernet.is/#:~:text=Othernet%20delivers%20a%20multi,communication%20platform%20accessible%20to%20all) ) ( [Othernet](https://othernet.is/#:~:text=Emergency%20Management%20and%20Disaster%20Relief) ). They require an initial hardware cost (~$100 for a basic kit) but no subscription after. If you have the technical interest and funds, consider joining the pilot. We aim to have at least a few members per region with these by Phase 3. Even if you personally can’t get one, be aware of who in your squad or area has one (so you know who might have intel post-disaster).
    
- **Maintain an “old school” comms method:** In addition to HAM (from Phase 1.1), consider easier two-way options for short range: FRS/GMRS walkie-talkies (no license needed for FRS, cheap at big-box stores) so you can talk to family or neighbors within a mile or two. Or CB radio (no license, mobile units ~$40) for local area comms and to potentially reach truckers or other CB users in an emergency. Make sure whatever you get, you test it. For example, give your neighbor one of your walkie-talkies and see if you can talk from home to home. Pre-agree on a channel to monitor in emergencies.
    
- **Create a communications plan (COMMS SOP):** Write down important frequencies, channels, and contacts. This might include: your local HAM emergency net freq, FRS Channel 1 (or whatever for your neighborhood), the phone number of an out-of-state relative (for relaying messages), and even meeting times (“If all comms fail, we will rendezvous at X location at noon daily”). This should be part of your emergency plan document. Share this with your family and possibly your Phase 2 squad once formed.
    
- **EMP protection for critical electronics:** Use a DIY Faraday cage or bag to store backups of crucial devices. For example, get a large metal ammo can or steel trash can with a tight lid, line it with cardboard, and place a spare radio, old cell phone, and backup hard drive inside ([EMP Protection for the Radio Amateur, an Encore. - Off Grid Ham](https://offgridham.com/2018/02/emp-encore/#:~:text=Charles%E2%80%99%20testing%20demonstrates%20that%20the,as%20one%20of%20the%20layers)). Seal any gaps with metallic tape. This nested, insulated metal shielding can protect against EMP and lightning surges. _Budget tip:_ Even wrapping devices in several layers of aluminum foil (with no gaps) and then putting in a metal tin can offer significant protection – practically free. It sounds extreme, but it’s cheap insurance. At the very least, keep devices unplugged and antennas disconnected when not in use to reduce vulnerability ([HAM Radio Protection - EMP - Disaster Preparer](https://disasterpreparer.com/product/hamsurge/?srsltid=AfmBOor0WG-YjJneAOVOERN-xsgOiLyOxgUGaZpLZWp9W3NBHiVbp1dW#:~:text=There%20are%20a%20number%20of,the%20antenna%20when%20not)).
    
- **Off-grid power for comms:** As part of your Phase 1.3 supplies, ensure you have a way to power your communication tools. This could be as simple as a pack of AA batteries and a solar battery charger (some models ~$20). If you have a car, a DC car charger for your devices is a must (you can use your car as a generator sparingly). If budget allows, a small solar panel (20W-100W) with a charge controller and deep-cycle battery can keep radios and phones charged indefinitely – many hams set up such systems for Field Day. Practice using these: know how many hours of sun to charge your radio, etc.
    
- **Know your information sources:** Pre-download maps of your area on your phone (offline maps) and key references (like first aid guides, the FPA Compass PDF, etc.) so you’re not reliant on live internet. Consider getting physical maps and a printed contact list of emergency numbers (police, fire, neighbors). If you have a shortwave radio (many NOAA radios double as shortwave receivers), note frequencies of stations like the BBC or other international broadcasters which often can be heard when local stations are down. In Phase 3, FPA plans to broadcast updates via certain channels – those will be communicated (e.g., an HF radio frequency where FPA national net operates). Make sure to update your notes with those once available.
    

**Phase 1.6: Implement a mentorship & skill-sharing system so each new member is paired with an experienced member by 2025.**  
_Real-world example:_ Preparedness can be daunting alone. Having a “battle buddy” dramatically increases follow-through. For instance, in 2024 we piloted a mentorship program: a new member in Detroit was paired with a veteran member in Pennsylvania who had gone through the 2003 blackout. Through weekly check-ins, the new member was guided to assemble his first emergency kit and pass his HAM exam within months – something he admitted he would have procrastinated on without accountability. In another case, a single mother in Kansas was mentored by an EMT in the FPA; the mentor walked her through creating a family fire escape plan and even spoke to her teenage kids (who were more likely to listen to an outside “coach”). The result: that family successfully evacuated from a kitchen fire because they had practiced it twice before. These examples show the power of mentorship: it turns online advice into real action through human connection and pressure (the good kind). By the end of Phase 1, every incoming FPA member should have at least one connection to lean on – we’re building a culture where _no one prepares in isolation_.

_Lessons learned:_ We learned early on that enthusiasm often tapers off without reinforcement. Many people join FPA during or after a scare (say, a nearby earthquake) but then get complacent when life feels normal again. A mentor or squad mate can nudge them to keep going. Another lesson: **knowledge transfer accelerates with personal contact.** Reading the FPA Dictionary can teach definitions, but talking to someone who’s “been there, done that” teaches wisdom. One mentor, a veteran of the 1970s New York blackout, shared how critical cash on hand was – a detail his mentee then acted on by building an emergency cash stash, which later helped her when ATMs went down during a power outage. We also found that mentorship combats a common issue: **analysis paralysis** (new folks getting overwhelmed by gear options or scenarios). An experienced prepper can simplify things: “Here’s a short list, just do these first.” On the flip side, mentors reported learning new things too – mentees sometimes bring fresh perspectives or research new tech (like our younger members improving the FPA app features). So it’s two-way learning, reinforcing that everyone has value. We must ensure the mentorship program stays informal and supportive, not bureaucratic. The “honest coach” style is key: frank feedback, no sugarcoating, but also no judgment. If a mentee falls behind, the mentor helps troubleshoot why, rather than scold. A big lesson from failures: if a mentor-mentee pair doesn’t click, reassign quickly – personality fit matters. Finally, from a decentralization standpoint, this buddy system seeds the connections that will later form local squads (Phase 2). In summary, **people empower people**, and we’re institutionalizing that.

**Action Steps:**

- **Establish contact with your mentor/mentee:** If you’re new to FPA (joined in Phase 1), request a mentor through the FPA app or local chapter. If you’re an experienced member (say you’ve completed most Phase 1 milestones already), volunteer to mentor someone less experienced. We will try to pair folks within similar time zones or regions when possible. Once paired, introduce yourselves via a call or meeting. Exchange non-internet contact info (phone numbers, radio call signs) in case the grid’s down and you need to reach each other.
    
- **Set mutual goals and schedule check-ins:** The mentor and mentee should agree on a few milestones to hit in a given timeframe – often these will align with Phase 1 tasks. For example: “By next month, let’s get your 72-hour kit together and do a short power-out drill.” Schedule regular check-ins (maybe 30 minutes weekly or biweekly). Put it on the calendar and stick to it as much as possible. Treat it like a serious appointment. If life gets in the way, reschedule promptly. Consistency builds momentum.
    
- **Use the “honest coach” approach:** Mentors should be supportive but direct. If a mentee hasn’t done what they said they would, address it bluntly: e.g., “You said you’d buy a fire extinguisher by now – what’s the holdup? Let’s figure out why and solve it.” Mentees, be open about your challenges (time, money, family buy-in, etc.). The more honest you both are, the more practical the solutions. Remember, the goal is to actually get things done, not just talk.
    
- **Skill exchange:** Mentorship doesn’t imply one person knows everything. It’s likely each of you has strengths. Maybe the mentor is great at medical skills while the mentee is an IT whiz who can set up mesh networks. Swap knowledge. Schedule a session where the “junior” teaches the “senior” one of their skills (for instance, a mentee might teach the mentor how to use a new secure messaging app or blockchain wallet for FPA). This keeps the relationship reciprocal and respectful.
    
- **Accountability checks:** Use simple accountability tools – for instance, share photos as proof of progress (“Here’s my updated bug-out bag contents laid out on the floor” or “Here’s me at the firing range practicing with my pepper spray”). It’s not about policing, it’s about celebrating progress and keeping it real. Many people respond well to the little dopamine hit of showing someone else “I did it.”
    
- **Connect to broader community:** Mentors should introduce mentees to the wider FPA community channels – invite them to local meetups, get them on the forum or radio nets, etc. The earlier a new member feels part of the tribe, the more likely they are to stay engaged. If you’re geographically close, an in-person meet (even if just a coffee chat about prepping) can solidify the bond. If distant, consider group video chats with a few mentor pairs to share experiences.
    
- **Escalate if issues arise:** If a pairing isn’t working out (communication issues, personality clash, or mentor/mentee becomes unresponsive), don’t let it just fizzle. Contact the regional coordinator or post on the app’s mentor forum to get help. We can re-pair people; there’s no stigma. The end goal is everyone ends up with a compatible partner. Also, mentors should not become overbearing or authoritarian – if you sense that, speak up. We mentor to empower, not to control. Transparency is key: no hazing, no elitism.
    
- **Grow into Phase 2 teams:** Start identifying who among your contacts (mentors, mentees, maybe a couple of other solo preppers you know) could form a local squad. Mentors can help introduce mentees to others nearby as FPA membership grows. The buddy system in Phase 1 is a stepping stone to the squad system in Phase 2. Keep an eye out for people in your area with complementary skills – those will be natural allies later.
    

### Contingency Plan: Phase 1

No plan survives first contact with reality – that applies to Phase 1 too. We anticipate potential setbacks for individuals and have outlined contingencies:

- **Financial Hardship:** If a member cannot afford certain supplies or training fees, FPA will facilitate workarounds. For example, we encourage skill swaps and gear sharing. Can’t afford a $100 radio? Maybe another member has a spare to lend or a group buy can reduce cost. We’re also setting up a _Gear Library_ in some regions where members can borrow items (like a satellite phone or NV goggles) rather than buy. Additionally, focus on the _free_ steps first: knowledge costs nothing. If money for food stockpiling is tight, emphasize foraging knowledge, community food pantries, or government distributions which can be stored. **Bottom line:** lack of funds will not be an excuse to throw up hands – we find another way, even if it’s scrappier. A prepared mind can jury-rig solutions (e.g., make a rocket stove from cinder blocks instead of buying a Coleman stove). FPA will also seek sponsorships or grants to cover training for low-income members (for instance, we might partner with Red Cross to waive class fees). Members should communicate needs – we can’t help if we don’t know.
    
- **Time Constraints and Burnout:** Life is busy. If a member falls behind on milestones due to work, family, or plain burnout, the contingency is to **prioritize and simplify.** Mentors will help refocus on the 20% of tasks that give 80% of the benefit. It’s okay to adjust the timeline – preparedness isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. If someone can’t attend that CERT course this quarter, schedule the next one and maybe do some interim self-study. If daily life intervenes (new baby, job loss), we pause and resume when possible. FPA leadership will monitor general progress; if many individuals are missing a particular milestone, maybe our expectations or support need adjusting. We will remain flexible. One concrete measure: we maintain an online checklist for Phase 1 that members update – if we see lots of incomplete items, we’ll do “catch-up months” focusing on those via additional workshops or motivational challenges. We also combat burnout by reminding _why_ we do this: real stories of lives saved because of a prep. The tone stays blunt but also encouraging: **you’re doing this for your family’s survival, so keep pushing.**
    
- **Technology Failures (e.g., FPA app outage):** Phase 1 leans on tools like the FPA app, AI chatbot, etc., which themselves could fail (servers crash, cyber attack, etc.). Contingency: all critical info and tools have offline equivalents. We have the _Offline System_ – a set of downloadable or printable guides covering how to run “Test My Plan” manually, printed lists of radio frequencies, etc. Every member is urged to keep a hard copy of key documents (like this roadmap’s highlights, Compass Guide, emergency contacts). If the FPA app’s _Test My Plan_ goes down the week you want to use it, use the paper version or discuss scenarios with your mentor as a manual simulation. For the FPAi Chatbot, contingency is old-fashioned Q&A: consult the FPA Dictionary (it’s offline-capable) or radio an experienced member for advice. We will also establish an email or phone hotline for critical support if the fancy app is unavailable. In essence, **nothing in Phase 1 should ever hinge on a single technology.** We always have a backup method, often analog. Members are encouraged to practice using these low-tech backups too, so it’s not foreign when needed.
    
- **Decentralization Risks:** In Phase 1, decentralization risk is about individuals going off-script or getting bad info from outside sources. Without a centralized command, some members might pick up fringe ideas (say, someone on YouTube convincing them to spend money on a gold-plated water filter instead of actually storing water). To counter this, FPA fosters a culture of **critical thinking and verification**. The _Trust Doctrine_ (see FPA Dictionary) encourages members to verify claims through the group before acting. If an individual is following a harmful path (e.g., neglecting safety by storing fuel improperly due to some internet tip), mentors or other members should intervene with frank advice. Transparency helps here: members often post their plans or preps in our forums – if something’s way off, seasoned folks will call it out (kindly but firmly). Also, to avoid any single point of failure in knowledge, we disseminate information widely: for example, not just one PDF on first aid, but also in-person workshops, videos, etc. If a key leader or expert in Phase 1 (say a go-to radio guru) disappears, the info they had is already in our shared materials.
    
- **Lack of Engagement:** Some members might simply drop out or go dormant. The contingency plan is to **reach out and reactivate**. Mentors will check in on quiet members; if someone leaves the program, their mentor can adopt a new mentee to keep capacity up. We also plan periodic Phase 1 refresh events – e.g., a “Preparedness Challenge Month” open to all members to re-do a drill or update kits, which can re-engage those who drifted. Ultimately, individuals have freedom – we can’t force participation. But by building a strong peer network (not just top-down direction), we create a sense of belonging that pulls people back in. Transparency also means if someone leaves, others know – maybe a friend in the group gives them a nudge to return. We view dropout not as failure but as a temporary setback to overcome with outreach and adjustments.
    
- **Emergency Before Completion:** Perhaps the most critical contingency: what if a disaster strikes before Phase 1 is fully done for someone? In other words, you’re only halfway prepared when the real test comes. The plan here is **“any preparation is better than none.”** Even if you haven’t hit every target, use what you have. For instance, if a member hasn’t gotten a HAM license yet when a hurricane hits, they should still use whatever radio they have legally (if life-and-death, in the US even unlicensed use on HAM frequencies can be tolerated under distress). Or if you only have 1 week of food instead of 2, ration immediately and coordinate with neighbors – perhaps others have extra. Phase 1 sets ideals, but reality might cut in line. So we encourage a mindset of improvisation: use the training you do have, adapt the tools you do have. The network (Phase 3) will eventually be there, but in the immediate, fall back on personal ingenuity and any local contacts (proto-squads). After the event, learn from it – your post-mortem experience will be priceless input to improving this roadmap.
    

By addressing funding issues, tech reliance, decentralized info, and the possibility of incomplete prep, we aim to make Phase 1 **resilient**. The theme of contingencies is redundancy and flexibility: never relying on only one approach, always having a fallback. This way, Phase 1 itself embodies the resilience we’re trying to build in every individual member. If Phase 1 succeeds – even imperfectly – each member becomes a self-sufficient node of competence, ready to link with others in Phase 2.

_(Phase 1 complete. This concludes Batch 1: Introduction and Phase 1 content. Members should review these sections and confirm understanding before proceeding to Phase 2.)_

# Phase 2: Local Squad Formation (FPA Mk1Mod3, Batch 2)

## Overview

Phase 2 of the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) roadmap focuses on **Local Squad Formation** – building self-sufficient, community-based teams ready to respond when disaster strikes. In Phase 1, we established the FPA’s mission, resources (like the FPA Dictionary and Compass Guide), and initial member training. Now Phase 2 channels those foundations into action on the ground. Each local “squad” is a decentralized unit of neighbors and volunteers equipped with basic skills, communications tools, and a mandate for aggressive realism: assume help **won’t** arrive soon and prepare to fend for yourselves and your community. This phase’s scope covers recruiting squad members, organizing them, drilling key skills, integrating with official agencies where possible, and scaling up the network of squads. The ultimate goal is blunt but clear – **every vulnerable community should have a functional response squad** before disaster hits. Phase 2 bridges the groundwork of Phase 1 into tangible local readiness, and it sets the stage for Phase 3’s broader network coordination and long-term resilience measures.

## Milestones

1. **Milestone 1: Grassroots Recruitment Drive**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ After Hurricane Sandy, a group of NYC activists launched “Occupy Sandy” and rapidly mobilized ~60,000 volunteers through social media and local churches ([Ten Years Ago, Occupy Sandy Didn’t Just Help New Yorkers, It Redefined Disaster Response | THE CITY — NYC News](https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/10/28/ten-years-occupy-sandy-disaster-response/#:~:text=Based%20on%20relationships%20forged%20and,and%20even%20help%20rebuild%20homes)). They simply put out the call for help, and people showed up in droves. This showed that in crises, ordinary people **will** volunteer if asked and organized.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Don’t wait for perfect conditions – **start recruiting now**. Occupy Sandy’s success came from existing community networks and the urgency of a crisis. A proactive squad can’t rely on spontaneous turnout alone; it must recruit before a disaster. Leverage any local group or prior connections (PTAs, faith groups, hobby clubs) to find willing hands. **Lesson:** When neighbors know and trust you beforehand, they respond faster and more reliably during an emergency.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Map out community hotspots: markets, schools, events – places to meet potential volunteers.
            
        - Create a simple pitch (flyer or 2-minute spiel) explaining FPA’s mission and why a local squad matters. Emphasize protecting _our_ neighborhood.
            
        - Host an info session or table at a community event (even if it’s just a folding table at the park). **Talk to people** – nothing beats face-to-face enthusiasm.
            
        - Use free outreach: library bulletin boards, neighborhood Facebook/WhatsApp groups, local radio PSAs, and word-of-mouth through existing community leaders.
            
        - Start a sign-up sheet (online or paper) to capture contact info of interested folks; follow up within 48 hours so momentum isn’t lost.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If turnout is low, don’t be discouraged – a squad can start with just 2–3 committed people. In a pinch, begin with family and friends. If public meetings aren’t allowed (e.g. pandemic restrictions), pivot to virtual meetups or one-on-one outreach. Always have an **elevator pitch** ready; even a chance encounter can recruit a member. To navigate skepticism, be transparent about goals and avoid jargon – build trust gradually. Worst-case, tie into an existing volunteer network (like CERT or a church group) as a starting nucleus rather than going it entirely alone.
        
2. **Milestone 2: First Squad Meeting**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ In one FPA pilot town, three neighbors who barely knew each other met at a local cafe after a storm-induced blackout. Over coffee by flashlight, they swapped ideas and phone numbers – the humble start of that community’s first squad. Such informal first meetings, even with tiny attendance, set the cooperative tone.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Meet in person early.** Face-to-face interaction cements commitment in a way online chats don’t. Keep it informal and welcoming – remember, these are neighbors not military recruits. Early meetings often reveal hidden talents (the quiet retiree might be a former nurse; the teenager might know drones). Use this time to let everyone speak. **Lesson:** early inclusion builds member investment and surfaces skills and concerns you didn’t know existed.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Set a date, time, and accessible location (public library, community center, or someone’s backyard) for the inaugural squad meeting. Provide refreshments if possible – breaking bread breaks the ice.
            
        - Prepare a brief agenda: introductions, a recap of FPA’s purpose, an open brainstorm of local risks, and next steps. Keep it under 90 minutes.
            
        - Go around and have each person share their motivation for joining and any skills/resources they have. Take note of these openly (whiteboard or notepad).
            
        - Clearly outline the **immediate goal**: form a core team and schedule regular meetups. Avoid overwhelming newbies with too much planning on Day 1.
            
        - Collect everyone’s preferred contact info and establish a primary communication channel on the spot (text group, Signal, email list—whatever all are comfortable using).
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If only 1–2 people show up, treat it as a success – you have a core. Document the discussion and reschedule another meeting, asking each attendee to bring one friend next time. If no public venue is available (or safe), utilize a group phone call or video chat as a fallback to get things rolling. Maintain momentum by scheduling the **next meeting** before adjourning the first, even if turnout was small. Low attendance can be improved with personal invites; lack of any meeting will kill the effort entirely.
        
3. **Milestone 3: Define Squad Purpose and Values**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A newly formed flood-response squad in a low-income borough drafted a simple mission statement: “We neighbors band together to prepare, rescue, and recover – **no one left behind**.” This clarity helped unify members who otherwise had diverse backgrounds and agendas. When a flash flood hit months later, everyone knew their squad’s role: check on vulnerable residents, share supplies, and relay information to all.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Early on, explicitly agree on what the squad is **and isn’t**. It prevents conflicts down the line. Are you focused on disaster response only, or also on general community service? Decide how you align with FPA’s core values (decentralization, transparency, empowerment). **Lesson:** A team charter or mission, even if informal, guides decision-making and brings cohesion. It also signals to outsiders (like officials or potential funders) that you’re serious and organized.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - In a meeting, draft a short mission statement collaboratively. Aim for 1–3 sentences that any member can memorize and recite.
            
        - List the key values that will shape your work (e.g. “neighbor helping neighbor,” “self-reliance,” “share openly,” “safety first”). These can mirror FPA’s broader principles but make them your own.
            
        - Agree on scope: for example, will the squad assist in all hazards (fire, storm, quake) or specialize (like only wildfire defense)? Will you also do preparedness education or just emergency response? Write this down.
            
        - Establish a simple decision process: consensus if possible, or majority vote for major decisions? Emphasize that **all members have a voice** – empowerment is key.
            
        - Document this purpose and values statement (even in an email or shared doc) and distribute to all members. New recruits should get this orientation too.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If there’s disagreement on purpose (e.g., some want to include crime watch or other unrelated efforts), table the non-emergency topics for now. Remind the group that Phase 2’s priority is disaster prep and response – other community issues can be tackled once core readiness is achieved (perhaps spin off later). In case of stalemate, defer to the overarching FPA mission as a guidepost. Keep the initial charter flexible; it can be revised in future if needed by consensus.
        
4. **Milestone 4: Establish Team Roles (Decentralized Leadership)**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A volunteer fire brigade in a rural county found success by rotating leadership – every month, a different member acted as “incident lead” for drills. This prevented burnout of one leader and empowered all to take charge. Similarly, one FPA pilot squad designated a few key roles from the start (like communications lead, medical lead, logistics lead), but kept authority flat, with the “Squad Coordinator” acting more like a facilitator than a boss. The result was a resilient team where any person could step up if another was absent.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Hierarchy should be minimal – **decentralization** is the name of the game. However, clear functional roles avoid chaos. The sweet spot is to assign responsibilities without creating rank. **Lesson:** Spread knowledge so the group isn’t reliant on a single “hero.” For example, everyone should know how to use the radio, not just the Comms Lead. A blunt reality is someone _will_ be unavailable during a crisis, so have backups for every critical role.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Elect or volunteer a **Squad Coordinator** (or co-coordinators) to organize meetings and be a point of contact. Emphasize this is an administrative role, not a commander.
            
        - Identify other key needs: likely **Communications/Tech**, **Medical/Safety**, **Logistics/Supplies**, **Training/Drills**, and **Liaison** (for external relations). Have members volunteer for lead responsibility in one area each, according to their interests or expertise.
            
        - Ensure every lead has at least one backup or assistant. For example, if Jane is Comms Lead, maybe John will be secondary in case Jane’s away. Redundancy is safety.
            
        - Clearly document these roles and share with the team. Each lead should draft a brief description of their duties so others understand who handles what (e.g., “Logistics Lead manages our supply stash and tracks gear loans”).
            
        - Schedule cross-training: plan that members will periodically swap roles during practice scenarios to prevent siloing of knowledge.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If no one wants to step up as coordinator, consider a rotating facilitator for each meeting rather than a fixed leader. If one person tries to dominate (a “self-appointed general”), gently remind them and everyone that FPA squads run on collaboration and transparency, not top-down orders. To avoid friction, embed the value that **leadership is a service role** – leaders serve the team by organizing, not by bossing. If roles aren’t getting filled (e.g., no one with medical background), note it as a capability gap and plan to seek external training or partnerships to cover it (for instance, have everyone take a Red Cross first aid class to collectively fill the “medical lead” gap).
        
5. **Milestone 5: Inventory Community Skills and Resources**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ One coastal squad’s secret weapon turned out to be a local butcher who owned a walk-in freezer and a gas generator – crucial for cold storage during power outages. Another member had an old shortwave radio; another was an ex-paramedic. By pooling knowledge, they discovered they already had a mini fire station’s worth of capability among them. Mapping these out early let them plan who would bring what when a hurricane approached.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Your members and community likely have untapped assets. From practical skills (trade work, medical, mechanical, languages) to physical resources (tools, trucks, boats, chain saws, extra bedding), **know what you have before buying new**. This milestone underscores empowerment: showing members that their day-job skills or hobbies can save lives in a crisis. **Lesson:** A low-resource community can still be resource-rich in other ways – catalog it. Also, identifying gaps (no one in the group with medical training? no generator in the neighborhood?) early on guides what training or equipment to pursue.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Circulate a simple survey to squad members (and even supportive neighbors who aren’t formally in the squad): What skills do you have? What equipment or tools could you share in an emergency? Do you have any medical or military training? 4x4 vehicle? Ham radio license? List it.
            
        - Compile the responses into a “Skills & Assets Register”. This could be a shared spreadsheet or even a poster on the wall at meetings. Make it visible to the team.
            
        - Identify key categories: Medical (first aid, nursing), Communications (tech savvy, radio license), Security (anyone with crowd management or defense training), Logistics (trucks, boats, heavy tools), etc., and see who/what covers each.
            
        - Mark any glaring gaps. Prioritize filling these via recruitment (find someone who has it), training an existing member, or obtaining needed equipment through donation or purchase.
            
        - Revisit this inventory periodically (people move away, new folks join, someone buys new equipment). Keep it updated so you’re never guessing in a crisis who might handle a task.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If people are shy or modest about their skills, do this as a casual group discussion to draw them out instead of a formal survey. If privacy is a concern (some may not want wider community knowing what they have, like a generator), keep the detailed inventory within the squad only and handle sensitive info respectfully. In the absence of certain critical skills (say no medically trained person at all), contact nearby squads or CERT teams – perhaps an adjacent community’s nurse can advise or assist your squad if needed, forming a mutual aid pact.
        
6. **Milestone 6: Basic Training Enrollment**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ The town of Springfield’s squad made it a point that within 3 months of forming, every member completed the Community Emergency Response Team **(CERT)** basic course. They coordinated with the local emergency management office to host a class just for their neighborhood. Those who couldn’t attend in person took FEMA’s free online **Independent Study** courses (IS-100 for Incident Command, IS-200, and IS-317 for CERT). When a tornado struck a year later, first responders recognized the green CERT vests and helmets of the squad members and knew they could be trusted with tasks – they had the credentials. This saved precious time in the response ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=The%20CERT%20program%20offers%20a,focus%20on%20more%20complex%20tasks)) ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=Community%20Emergency%20Response%20Team%20members,assist%20their%20neighbors%20during%20emergencies)).
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Training = credibility and capability.** Adopting established training (CERT, Red Cross, etc.) gives the squad common procedures and confidence. It also reassures professional responders that you’re not a ragtag group to be ignored. Even low-resource communities can access these trainings since they are often free. **Lesson:** Make use of what’s already out there; you don’t need to reinvent the wheel on basic disaster skills. And train **before** an incident – during one, it’s too late to Google how to do CPR.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Contact your local emergency management agency or fire department to find out about CERT training classes in your area. If none are scheduled, request one – many EM offices will organize a class if there’s sufficient interest (usually 15+ people).
            
        - Encourage all squad members to enroll. If scheduling is an issue, have them take FEMA’s **IS-317: Introduction to CERT** online as a primer ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=Whether%20you%27re%20already%20in%20the,free%20and%20available%20to%20anyone)). Follow up with hands-on practice later.
            
        - Identify other essential courses: First Aid/CPR (often free or low-cost through Red Cross or local clinics), basic firefighting (some fire departments offer community fire extinguisher training), and **IS-100 and IS-700** (FEMA’s intro to Incident Command System and National Incident Management System). These independent study courses are free and online – assign them as “homework” with a flexible deadline.
            
        - Organize low-cost group training if possible: for example, invite a local nurse to teach a “Stop the Bleed” workshop at a community center, or a veteran to demonstrate emergency shelter building. Leverage willing experts in your community for mini-courses.
            
        - Track who has completed which training in a simple roster. Recognize and celebrate these achievements (even if just a shout-out in a meeting) – it keeps motivation up. Equip trained members with any low-cost identifier (like a colored armband or cap during drills) so everyone knows who can do what in a pinch.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If formal training opportunities are scarce, use the FPA Compass Guide’s training modules (if available) to run your own in-squad training sessions. In truly remote or resource-poor areas with no internet, use printed manuals or handouts – FPA can help provide these via the Compass Guide. Should language be a barrier (e.g., some members aren’t fluent in English), tap bilingual members or translation resources to ensure understanding. Finally, if a member simply cannot attend any training due to work/childcare, try a **train-the-trainer** approach: one person attends and then teaches the rest in an informal session. No one gets left behind in skill-building.
        
7. **Milestone 7: Communication Tree and Alert System**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ In a seismic-prone city, one squad set up a “phone tree” call-down system: each person calls two others. They did a late-night test one day and reached 90% of members in under 10 minutes. Separately, a rural squad created a WhatsApp group that pinged everyone simultaneously, but when cell networks went down during a wildfire, that failed. The lesson was reinforced by a drill in another community where relying on cell phones overloaded the system – during an evacuation exercise, so many people tried to use phones that the network crashed ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=Great%20information%20Magdalena%21%20One%20of,all%20those%20great%20community%20leaders)). That community’s solution was training “road ambassadors” with radios as backup ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=Great%20information%20Magdalena%21%20One%20of,all%20those%20great%20community%20leaders)).
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ You need a redundant, layered **alert system** to mobilize the squad (and possibly the wider neighborhood). Electronic methods (group texts, apps) are convenient but may fail in disaster conditions. Old-school methods (phone trees, sirens, physical runners) shouldn’t be discounted. **Lesson:** Have at least two ways to reach each member. Also, practice it – an untested alert plan is just theory.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Compile a contact list of all squad members with multiple contact methods (cell, landline if any, email, social handle). Secure this list but ensure every member has a copy in some form (laminated card, or saved offline on their phone).
            
        - Establish a primary alert method for different scenarios: e.g., **Tier 1** – a WhatsApp/Signal group or SMS blast for when internet/cell is up; **Tier 2** – a phone tree (designate who calls whom) for when urgent voice contact is needed; **Tier 3** – physical methods for when phones are down (this could be designated people biking to certain blocks to shout or using whistles).
            
        - If available, integrate any local warning system: encourage members to sign up for official text alerts (e.g., FEMA Wireless Emergency Alerts, local reverse-911). The squad can act on those quickly as a trigger.
            
        - Run a communication drill: simulate an emergency at an odd hour. See how long it takes to reach everyone with Tier 1. Document who didn’t respond and follow up to update their info or method. Then simulate phone network failure and try Tier 2 or 3 (this could be done in a daytime drill for practicality).
            
        - Fine-tune based on drill results. Assign some members specific roles like “neighborhood runner” or “radio caller” for backup. Ensure even the low-tech tools are in place (e.g., everyone should have a whistle or know the designated meetup point if all else fails).
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If literacy or tech is an issue (some may not use smartphones), rely more on phone call trees or in-person notification. For hearing-impaired members, include text-based or visual signals (like a pre-agreed flashing porch light pattern for “need help” or “evacuate now”). Always assume the worst-case – if a disaster happens at 3 AM, power is out and cell towers are down, **how will you mobilize?** Plan for that scenario, not just the convenient ones. Keep the plan written and revisited; update it whenever membership changes.
        
8. **Milestone 8: Emergency Contact Sharing and Vulnerable Resident List**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A squad in Illinois learned during a winter blizzard that one of their elderly neighbors lived alone and had no close family – and they hadn’t known. She was found in her cold house, frightened but alive, because a squad member remembered her and trudged over. After that, the squad created a “vulnerable residents” checklist: who in our area might need special attention (elderly, disabled, those on medical devices, single parents with infants, etc.) and who is their emergency contact. This proved life-saving in a later heatwave when they proactively checked on those folks and found two without power who needed immediate cooling and hydration.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Preparedness must extend beyond just squad members. **Empowerment** in FPA means lifting up the whole community, especially those likely to be left behind. By identifying vulnerable neighbors and planning to assist them, squads fulfill the “fair” part of Fair Prep Alliance. But privacy is a concern – handle this info with sensitivity. **Lesson:** Make sure each vulnerable person is “owned” by someone in the squad (figuratively speaking) – i.e., someone committed to check on them when things go bad. Formalize these buddy assignments in advance.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - As a team, list out known individuals in the neighborhood who might need extra help in a disaster. Sources: personal knowledge, suggestions from community leaders, or simply noticing who might be isolated.
            
        - For each person on that list, attempt gentle outreach _before_ any disaster. For example, knock on their door on a sunny day: “Hi, we’re a local community safety group. We’d like to include you in our emergency plan if you’re okay with that.” Explain you’re not selling anything – you just want to make sure they are safe during emergencies.
            
        - Ask if they have family or an emergency contact you could have on file, and if they’d like to share any specific needs (oxygen machine? mobility issues? do they have a backup plan?). Participation is voluntary – respect a “no.”
            
        - Assign each willing vulnerable resident to a squad member as their point-of-contact. This member will take responsibility to check in on them during events (and possibly to evacuate or assist if needed). It can simply be “neighborly visits” when alarms sound.
            
        - Keep a confidential list of these residents, their addresses, key info, and contacts. This list should be accessible to squad leadership and the assigned buddies, but not broadcast publicly to protect privacy. Review and update it every few months, as situations change.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If some community members are suspicious or unwilling (perhaps fearing scams), do not push. You can still quietly keep an eye out for them when times get tough – just without formal agreement. If the squad is too small to cover everyone, prioritize by who has absolutely no one else. In events where squad capacity is overwhelmed, communicate with official responders about any high-priority need cases (fire departments often will act on specific addresses if informed). Always maintain privacy: use initials or codes on your internal list in case it’s lost, and stress to members this info is sensitive. A breach of trust here could alienate the very people you aim to help.
        
9. **Milestone 9: Map Your Zone and Risks**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A squad in a floodplain neighborhood took an afternoon to walk the area, marking up a printed map with things like: low spots that always fill with water, houses of immobile residents, locations of fire hydrants, propane tanks, and even the nearest hills that could serve as shelter. They also noted assets: a grocery store (potential food source), a school (designated shelter site), and a community center with a backup generator. When heavy rains came and the river swelled, they knew exactly which four blocks to focus on first for evacuation and where to set up a safe rally point on high ground. Their prior mapping shaved critical time off their response.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Know your turf.** This is practical empowerment: you don’t wait for authorities to tell you what’s important in your neighborhood – you find out and own that knowledge. Visualizing hazards and resources on a map (even a hand-drawn one) is far better than vague ideas. **Lesson:** By pre-identifying choke points, shelter spots, and danger zones, your squad can act decisively under pressure. This localized intelligence is something outsiders won’t have, which is exactly why local squads matter.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Obtain or draw a map of your area. This could be a large printed Google map, a hand-sketched layout of the streets, or using a tool like OpenStreetMap if tech allows. Define your core “operational area” (e.g., our apartment complex, or our 4-block radius, or our village).
            
        - Mark hazard-related features: flood-prone areas, tall old trees that might fall, wooden structures (fire risk), industrial sites (chemical hazard?), etc. Use different colored markers or symbols. If you’re not sure, talk to longtime residents for historical insight (“that alley always floods first” or “that hill had a landslide in ’98”).
            
        - Mark resource-related features: water sources (well, community pump), potential shelter buildings (church, school, sturdy hall), medical facilities (clinic, pharmacy), and known supplies (hardware store, food markets). Also mark squad member homes and the vulnerable residents identified in Milestone 8.
            
        - Identify rally points: safe locations where the squad can gather during or after a disaster (preferably open area or high ground depending on scenario). Also decide on an emergency operations spot – maybe someone’s garage or a community building that can serve as a coordination center if possible. Mark these clearly.
            
        - Analyze the map as a group. Draw arrows for likely evacuation routes, note any single points of failure (e.g., only one bridge out of the area – what if it’s out?). Develop simple contingency plans for any critical point (alternate routes, etc.). Keep the map handy – take photos of it for digital reference and update as you discover new info.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If mapping tools or prints are unavailable, sketch from memory and verify by walking. Involve community elders who often have the best memory of past incidents – their knowledge is a goldmine if high-tech mapping isn’t in reach. If your area is too large for one map, break it into sectors and perhaps have sub-teams focus on each. Should critical infrastructure be outside your immediate area (like a power substation uphill), note it even if it’s not on your block; disasters don’t respect boundaries. Lastly, share relevant findings with local authorities if appropriate – it could help them too (for example, letting the fire department know about an obstructed hydrant or a vulnerable propane tank is good citizenship).
        
10. **Milestone 10: Secure a Squad Home Base (Physical or Virtual)**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A suburban squad convinced the owner of a local café to let them use the backroom for monthly meetings and to store a couple of lockers with emergency supplies. This “home base” became known in the community – a small FPA sticker in the café window signaled that preparedness folks gather there. In a different scenario, an urban apartment-based squad had no single physical space, so they established a virtual base: a group on a messaging app and a shared cloud folder for documents. That became their hub of coordination. During a citywide blackout, they couldn’t use the cloud, but they had earlier printed key info and stashed it in a member’s apartment (serving as an ad-hoc base).
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Every squad needs a **base of operations**. This could be as simple as a closet of supplies or as formal as an agreement to use a community center office. It provides stability, a rally point, and a place to keep important materials. If a physical space isn’t feasible, designate an alternate method to anchor the group (like an online hub plus some distributed caches of supplies). **Lesson:** A base, even a modest one, greatly improves organization and sustains the squad’s presence. It’s also a psychological anchor – members know “where to go” when unsure.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Survey options for a physical base: Is there a local business, church, school, or even a member’s garage or shed that could host some of your squad’s stuff and possibly serve as a meeting spot or command post during incidents? Approach the owner/authority with your squad’s mission (show your mission statement!) and how it benefits the community. Emphasize transparency and that you’ll take good care of any space or equipment.
            
        - If granted a space, equip it gradually: a cabinet or tote with first aid supplies, maps, flashlights, copies of important documents (contact lists, maps, protocols), and perhaps spare batteries or a charger. Keep it locked or supervised to prevent misuse (if in a public area).
            
        - If no dedicated space is available, create a “virtual HQ.” Use a reliable group chat as the day-to-day coordination point. Additionally, prepare a **go-box** that one of the coordinators keeps at home: this box has printed rosters, the map, some basic supplies and maybe a cheap spare phone or radio. This box in an emergency can be brought to a pre-agreed spot to act as a mobile HQ.
            
        - Publicize (within the group and to trusted community contacts) where the base is or who has the go-box. Everyone should know “if something happens and you’re lost, go here or contact this person.”
            
        - Back up important info in multiple forms: the cloud is great until internet is out; paper is reliable but can burn. Use both. For instance, store digital files of contacts on a USB drive in the go-box, and also have a laminated phone tree list physically there. Redundancy counts.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If using someone’s private property, ensure there’s a clear understanding of access (Do all members have a key? Only leaders?). Have a secondary site in mind if the primary is inaccessible (e.g., if the café is itself damaged in a quake). In case of eviction from a space, keep your materials portable so relocating is easy. If security of stored items is a concern (theft, etc.), keep only low-value but useful items at the base, and have members individually hold more valuable gear at their homes. Ultimately, the “base” concept is flexible – the key is the squad knows how to quickly regroup and access shared resources, rather than every person fending for themselves in chaos.
        
11. **Milestone 11: Acquire Basic Gear via Low-Cost Methods**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A low-income squad in Detroit built their own supply cache almost entirely from donations and creativity. They held a “prep drive” at the local grocery store where people donated canned food and flashlights. A construction company donated a couple of high-visibility vests and hard hats. The squad coordinator scrounged surplus medical supplies (bandages, gloves) from a friend who works at a clinic. Within months, they had a respectable community emergency kit without spending more than $50 of their own funds. In contrast, another group that waited for grants wasted precious time; gear trickled in a year later, but they had already faced a blizzard empty-handed.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Don’t wait for perfect equipment** – start gathering essentials in any way possible. Low-resource communities often have to be inventive. A lot of useful items are cheap or free if you ask around. And remember, knowledge beats gear if you must choose; but ideally have both. **Lesson:** Prioritize gear that enables members to act safely (e.g., gloves, helmets, lights) and communicate (radios, whistles). FPA’s aggressive realism means acknowledging that in a true disaster, store shelves empty fast – so build your cache in calm times.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Make a checklist of basic squad equipment. Suggested minimums: First aid kit (with trauma supplies), a few high-vis vests, work gloves for all members, headlamps/flashlights with batteries, a battery-operated or hand-crank radio, dust masks, duct tape, tarps, a crowbar or multi-tool, and some bottled water and non-perishable snacks. Add any special items relevant to your local risks (chainsaw if in forest fire country, life vests if flood-prone, etc.).
            
        - Source creatively: run a donation drive in the community (people often have spare camping gear or tools lying around). Use social media or neighborhood apps to request items. Mention you’re an FPA squad doing this for community benefit – many are happy to give away things for a good cause.
            
        - Tap institutional sources: Ask local businesses for any spare emergency supplies or materials. Sometimes hardware stores will give a discount or donate items like buckets or shovels. Local government or CERT programs might have grants or leftover gear (e.g., CERT often provides a starter backpack; if some members took CERT, pool those supplies).
            
        - For any purchased items, look second-hand first (thrift stores for blankets, used equipment sales for tools). Every dollar saved is important. Keep receipts and records especially if you plan to seek reimbursement or demonstrate community support in grant applications later.
            
        - Store the gear in a central, secure location (see Milestone 10’s base). If that’s not possible, distribute among members’ homes but keep track of who holds what. Ensure everyone knows how to use each item – a shiny generator is useless if no one can operate it, so perhaps hold a “gear day” to familiarize the squad with everything.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If essential gear cannot be acquired in time (e.g., winter is coming and you have no space heaters or blankets for a warming center idea), have a plan B: know the location of the nearest public shelter or warming station set up by authorities. In an extreme scenario, the squad might focus more on guiding people to external help rather than direct action, until gear is built up. Always plan around what you _do_ have, not what you wish for. If lacking something critical, note it and work with partner organizations (maybe the Red Cross can cover first aid, etc.). Also avoid hoarding syndrome – store what you need for community response, not to outfit an army. Space and resources are limited; lean efficiency is part of being realistic.
        
12. **Milestone 12: First Aid & CPR Certification for Members**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ During a heatwave response, a squad member’s quick CPR on a heatstroke victim saved a life before paramedics arrived. That member had taken a basic CPR/AED course offered free at the YMCA. In another case, after a building explosion, a prepared squad in the vicinity treated bleeding wounds and fractures on multiple victims because half the team were trained in first aid. These scenarios underline how basic medical know-how is often the difference in the crucial first 10 minutes of an emergency.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ In disasters, professional medical help might be minutes or hours away. **Every squad member should ideally have basic first aid and CPR skills.** It’s one of the most empowering trainings – turning a bystander into a lifesaver. Even teens can learn these skills. **Lesson:** First aid training is low-cost (often free) and high-impact. Additionally, squads with medical proficiency gain trust; neighbors will turn to you for help if they know you’re trained, amplifying your positive impact.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Identify free or affordable first aid/CPR training in your area. Red Cross chapters frequently run classes, sometimes sponsored by community organizations. Fire departments or hospitals might do periodic trainings for the public. Leverage personal connections if any member works in healthcare or emergency services to arrange a session.
            
        - Aim to get as many members certified in CPR and basic first aid as possible. If formal classes aren’t accessible, use the **FPA Compass Guide** or online videos to host an in-squad training night. Use dummy props for CPR practice (even a pillow can simulate compressions) if mannequins aren’t available.
            
        - Supplement training with building actual kits: after learning, assemble personal first aid kits for each member (these can be small pouches with bandages, disinfectant, etc., often very low-cost). Also assemble a larger community trauma kit for the squad base including tourniquets, burn dressings, etc.
            
        - Practice medical scenarios during drills (e.g., simulate someone unconscious, have a member perform the steps: “Are you okay? Call 911. Start CPR.” etc.). Familiarity is key to reducing panic in real events.
            
        - Keep a list of who has up-to-date certifications and when refreshers are needed. Encourage ongoing skill sharpening – maybe a five-minute first-aid tip is shared at each meeting to keep knowledge fresh.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If some members are physically unable to perform certain actions (e.g., CPR compressions can be strenuous), assign them other medical roles like maintaining supply inventory or doing patient comfort and communication. They can still be crucial by directing medics to the scene or keeping records. If formal certification is out of reach cost-wise, remember that knowing _how_ is more important than the card itself. Push training even without certificates. Also, in some regions Good Samaritan laws and volunteer protection laws (like the U.S. Volunteer Protection Act of 1997) offer legal cover for those providing emergency care ([Cajun Navy Ground Force - Rob Gaudet - Arcadia Publishing](https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/products/9781455625734?srsltid=AfmBOoqiUHYg_8qqsDKNTi7XR30J4l4TIMVhjamEZZbRUvq4dYRgFczZ#:~:text=Publishing%20www,Navy%20Ground%20Force%2C%20from)) – educate your team on this to alleviate fear of liability when helping.
        
13. **Milestone 13: Safety and Self-Protection Protocols**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A volunteer in an earthquake response squad rushed into a partially collapsed house to check for occupants – without proper gear or backup. He ended up injured by falling debris. After this scare, that squad formalized a strict rule: _no member goes into a dangerous situation alone or without safety equipment._ They acquired hard hats, goggles, and dust masks and instituted a buddy system for any hazardous task. Similarly, a storm response team learned to pause and check for downed power lines and other hidden dangers before rushing into the fray. These protocols prevented further accidents.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **The squad can’t help others if its own members become casualties.** Integrate safety into every action. This includes personal protective equipment (PPE) and procedural rules like working in pairs. Transparency in FPA includes being honest about risks – discuss them openly so everyone respects the danger. **Lesson:** Heroics are less useful than steady, safe operations. A well-prepared squad looks after its own first (oxygen-mask principle) so they can sustain helping the community.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Develop a basic **safety checklist** for the squad: e.g., “Wear helmet, gloves, sturdy shoes in disaster zone; carry a flashlight at night; do not enter heavily damaged structures unless properly trained; treat all wires as live; use buddy system for search and rescue,” etc. This should be part of your squad SOP (Standard Operating Procedures).
            
        - Ensure acquisition of minimal PPE: hard hats or helmets (even bike helmets are better than nothing), leather work gloves, reflective vests, eye protection, dust masks or respirators (for smoke, dust). These can often be obtained via donations or at low cost; prioritize them in your gear list (see Milestone 11).
            
        - Train on tool safety if your squad will use them (chainsaws, generators, etc.). If no one is experienced, either avoid using those until trained or bring in someone (perhaps a local firefighter) to do a quick safety briefing/demo.
            
        - Emphasize **team accountability**: institute a check-in system during responses (“check every 15 minutes via radio or face-to-face to confirm all clear”). Assign a safety officer for drills who’s responsible for observing and calling out unsafe acts – rotate this role so everyone builds a safety mindset.
            
        - Integrate mental safety too: encourage a culture where anyone can shout “Stop!” if they sense danger or if something feels wrong. Empower even the newest member to voice a safety concern without fear of ridicule. It could save a life.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If PPE is scarce, do an honest triage of tasks – the squad should not perform high-risk operations (like heavy search & rescue in rubble or firefighting) without appropriate protection. It’s better to cordon off hazards and alert professionals than become additional victims. If members are overly eager and prone to risk-taking, have frank discussions using real case studies of volunteer injuries to underline the point. In the adrenaline of a crisis, it’s easy to slip – that’s why ingraining safety habits in calm times is critical. Should an injury occur despite precautions, have a protocol: administer first aid (you’re trained now), and know how to call in external help or evacuate the injured member.
        
14. **Milestone 14: Conduct the First Squad Drill**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ Six weeks after forming, a neighborhood squad carried out a simple evening drill: a “missing child in a storm” scenario. They split into pairs, searched the area with flashlights and walkie-talkies, and treated it like a real event. They uncovered a lot of kinks – confusion on radio protocol, two people went to the wrong location, one member realized their flashlight batteries were dead. But that’s exactly why they did it. Afterward, over hot cocoa, they debriefed with brutal honesty and laughter, fixing those errors. The next drill a month later (simulating a house fire evacuation) went markedly smoother, showing clear improvement.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Practice reveals flaws in a safe setting.** A drill turns abstract plans into muscle memory and identifies what you overlooked (often the small things). It also builds team cohesion and confidence: “We’ve done this before, we can do it again.” The first drill doesn’t need to be large or public – start small. **Lesson:** It’s far better to make mistakes in practice than in reality. Acknowledging failure points openly (transparency) and addressing them is part of FPA’s continuous improvement ethos.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Plan a simple scenario relevant to your top risk. Make it no-notice if possible (announce “drill” at a random time to simulate surprise). Or schedule it if needed for participation, but keep some element unannounced (like details of scenario) so it isn’t too scripted.
            
        - Assign roles: one or two to act as “controllers” or observers, and the rest as participants. For the first drill, it might be easiest if everyone just responds as they normally would and an organizer tosses in a challenge (“power is out” or “John, you’re injured and can’t move—tell them that when found”).
            
        - Use whatever gear and communication you would in real life. Treat it seriously – encourage members to _actually_ knock on a neighbor’s door or physically check a “safe house” spot, etc., as scenario demands (with prior permission if involving non-members).
            
        - After drill, gather immediately for debrief. Discuss what went well and what failed. Perhaps one person couldn’t hear on the radio, or people forgot steps. Capture these on paper. This is a **no-blame, learning** discussion – every mistake is a gift for improvement.
            
        - Update your plans and training based on the findings. If the flashlight issue happened, now “check batteries monthly” gets added to someone’s duties. If comms were chaotic, maybe implement simple radio codes or discipline. Plan the next drill addressing some of these improvements to see progress.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If turnout for the drill is low (only a few members available), scale the scenario down but proceed – even a partial team drill is useful. If someone panics or there is confusion, pause, explain, then continue – it’s a **learning environment**. Avoid extremely high-stress or dangerous simulations; keep it safe. If you lack realism (maybe no props or actors), just talking through steps while physically walking the area is still valuable (“tabletop exercise”). Document the lessons in a shared log (transparency ensures even absent members learn from it). Ensure no one’s pride is hurt by mistakes – frame everything as collective improvement, not individual failure.
        
15. **Milestone 15: Establish Regular Squad Meetings**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A community squad initially met sporadically, and interest waned. They switched to a consistent schedule – the first Monday of every month – and attendance solidified. People treated it like any other standing appointment. They kept meetings concise and purposeful: updates, a mini-training (like how to purify water), and social time. This rhythm built camaraderie. Another squad did biweekly check-ins via group text with a monthly in-person meetup. Consistency turned a loose group into a tight team over time.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Habits form through regularity. **Decentralization** doesn’t mean disorganized; it means self-driven structure. Regular meetings or touchpoints empower members by keeping them informed and involved. It’s also a chance to maintain transparency – discuss any developments, plans, or concerns openly. **Lesson:** Treat the squad like you would a sports team or club – practice and meet routinely, not just when something bad happens. This maintains readiness and cohesion.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Poll members for a feasible meeting frequency and schedule. Monthly is a common cadence that balances engagement with practicality. Lock in a predictable day (e.g., “3rd Thursday 7 PM each month at the library”).
            
        - If in-person every time is hard, mix it up: perhaps three months of short in-person meetings, then one virtual or conference call to catch up those who missed. Or alternate formal meetings with informal gatherings (like a barbecue that doubles as a planning chat). The key is keeping the connection alive.
            
        - Create a simple agenda template to ensure meetings are efficient: e.g., **Old Business** (updates on tasks from last time), **Training** (15-min skill refresher or guest speaker), **Upcoming Events/Drills**, **Needs & Issues**, and a quick **roundtable** for any member to speak. End with action item recap (who is doing what).
            
        - Keep minutes or at least notes of decisions and distribute them (transparency!). This way absent members stay in the loop and there’s accountability for tasks. Even just an email summary is fine.
            
        - Use meetings to rotate responsibilities: have different members lead the training segment or chair the meeting occasionally. This aligns with empowerment – everyone gets a turn to guide the group. It also avoids dependence on one organizer.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If people start skipping due to boredom or time crunch, reevaluate meeting content. Make sure each meeting has something valuable (new knowledge, planning of a cool project, etc.). If schedule conflicts are an issue, adjust frequency or timing – better to meet quarterly than not at all. Should the squad face a lull (no disasters for a long time, enthusiasm fades), inject purpose by setting small projects (e.g., “let’s all check fire hydrants for clearance this weekend and report back”). The ritual of gathering is more important than its format; even a group phone call can substitute if travel is hard. Just don’t let the squad go dark for long periods, or you’ll lose cohesion and have to rebuild interest from scratch.
        
16. **Milestone 16: Cross-Train in Multiple Skills**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ In one drill, the designated radio operator was away, and no one else knew how to properly use the HAM set to call for help. The squad learned from that embarrassment and instituted cross-training: now every member takes turns practicing with the radio, the first aid kit, the generator, and even leadership roles. A different squad had everyone rotate through a basic CERT role-play (fire suppression, cribbing for debris lifting, etc.). When an incident later occurred, a member confidently grabbed a fire extinguisher to put out a small fire while another set up the radio to relay information – tasks they only learned because they had swapped roles during training.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Silos kill resilience. While individuals may have specialties, **everyone should have working knowledge of all critical tasks.** Decentralization in practice means the group isn’t crippled by one person’s absence or weakness. Cross-training also deepens respect – members appreciate each other’s roles more when they try them. **Lesson:** Rotate duties in low-stakes times to avoid rotation in high-stakes times by necessity. Versatility is a hallmark of a strong squad.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Make a list of core skills/equipment that only one or two members currently handle (e.g., operating the radio, using the chainsaw, administering EpiPen, map reading/navigation, incident command coordination).
            
        - Pair up members so that each expert teaches at least one other person their skill. For example, the Comms Lead spends a session with a couple of others showing how to set frequencies on the handheld radio and proper radio etiquette. The medically inclined member teaches others how to splint an arm or do a patient assessment.
            
        - Integrate role rotation into drills: explicitly assign people to roles outside their comfort zone during scenarios. One drill, have someone else act as Incident Coordinator, another person handle first aid who normally wouldn’t, etc. Supervise so that mistakes become learning moments safely.
            
        - Encourage “ride-alongs” or shadowing: if a member attends a specialized training or event (say one attends a Red Cross seminar), have them bring another squad member or at least share the knowledge after.
            
        - Track cross-training progress. Ideally, aim for at least two people competent in each key skill. If you have enough members, three is better (redundancy!). This way, no single failure point exists in your human resource structure.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If certain skills are too advanced to fully cross-train (not everyone will become a licensed HAM operator easily, for instance, or not everyone can drive a big truck), ensure at minimum theoretical knowledge is spread (“If I’m not here, here’s how you turn on the radio and call channel X for help”). Write cheat sheets for complex tasks and keep them with the equipment – that at least gives a fighting chance for an untrained member to use it under guidance. If someone resists sharing knowledge (job protection mentality), stress that the squad’s survival could depend on anyone doing it. In the end, cross-training is about survival and effectiveness, not stepping on toes.
        
17. **Milestone 17: Develop External Partnerships (NGOs and Local Businesses)**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A coastal squad partnered with the local Red Cross chapter to co-host a “Prepareathon” fair. This connection meant that during a subsequent apartment fire, Red Cross knew exactly who the squad was and collaborated smoothly, handing off certain tasks (the squad managed a neighborhood donation drop-off point while Red Cross handled victim sheltering). Another squad befriended a pharmacy owner who agreed to stock extra emergency medical supplies and even let the squad store a cache of ice packs and insulin in their backroom fridge for power outage scenarios. When a blackout happened, that pharmacy became a community lifeline with the squad’s help.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **No squad is an island.** Tapping into established NGOs (like Red Cross, Salvation Army, local food banks, etc.) multiplies your effectiveness. They often have resources and training that can augment your low-budget operations. Likewise, local businesses can be crucial allies – they have infrastructure and supplies that might be repurposed in emergencies. Transparency and goodwill go a long way: by openly explaining your squad’s aims, you invite trust and support. **Lesson:** Build these bridges _before_ you need them. In a crisis, you don’t want to be introducing yourself for the first time.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Identify key NGOs and community organizations around: Red Cross, Community foundations, places of worship with relief missions, volunteer fire companies, etc. Reach out with a polite introduction: a short email or phone call explaining the FPA squad and suggesting a meeting or attendance at one of their events.
            
        - Offer to support their initiatives (volunteer at a charity drive, help a church distribute food boxes). By helping them, you both do good and show that your squad is a responsible community player and not just out for itself.
            
        - In conversations, pinpoint collaboration points: e.g., if the Red Cross sets up a shelter during disasters, maybe your squad can staff a table there to register local residents or do night watch. If a local restaurant has a big kitchen, maybe they could be the designated community kitchen during a prolonged outage (with squad members assisting).
            
        - Establish a liaison role in your squad (see Integration Protocols later) specifically to maintain these relationships. They should periodically check in with partners, share updates, and invite them to your drills or meetings occasionally.
            
        - Keep a contact directory of partner organizations – names, phone numbers, and roles. Also, exchange any emergency comms info (like “if cell fails, our squad will be on FRS channel 5, you can reach us through that” or similar). Essentially integrate them into your broader response plan where feasible.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If some organizations are initially skeptical or dismissive (“Who are these upstart volunteers?”), don’t be discouraged. It might take time and demonstrated reliability. Continue doing good work in the community – success and word of mouth will eventually get their attention. If businesses want liability assurances (worried about hosting volunteers or storing supplies), consider formalizing the partnership via an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) in simple terms, and highlight the Volunteer Protection Act or local Good Samaritan laws that support volunteer efforts in emergencies. FPA’s transparency principle means you should be clear that you’re not there to usurp anyone’s role – you’re there to fill gaps and support. Once they see that, many will welcome the helping hands.
        
18. **Milestone 18: Establish Liaison with Local Government (ICS Alignment)**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A squad leader in a small town took the initiative to meet the county emergency manager and police chief. She presented the FPA squad’s existence and training level. The officials were a bit wary at first, but she offered a liaison plan: during any incident, she (or her designated alternate) would report to the town’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) or Incident Command Post with a list of available squad resources and would relay official info back to her team. This closely mirrored the **Incident Command System (ICS)** principle of a Liaison Officer ([[PDF] INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM ICS POSITION: LIAISON OFFICER](http://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/f5559dd86dbe4a56dde8a871dcc9e775.pdf#:~:text=THE%20LIAISON%20OFFICER%27S%20FUNCTION%20IS,FROM%20ASSISTING%20AND%20COOPERATING%20AGENCIES)). Come the next flood, the squad liaison checked in with the EOC, plugged into the response, and was tasked with canvassing a neighborhood for survivors – effectively becoming an integrated auxiliary unit. The smooth coordination earned praise and now the local government treats the squad as a known partner.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Working with government can greatly amplify your reach (access to warnings, inclusion in coordinated response) if done correctly. However, it requires patience and proving competence. **ICS alignment** means your squad understands how official command works and fits in rather than creating chaos. **Lesson:** Be proactively transparent and cooperative with authorities – it builds trust. At the same time, maintain your squad’s autonomy; you are a partner, not subordinates, which actually helps officials because you’re self-sufficient. If authorities ignore or reject help, the squad should be prepared to operate independently _safely_, but giving them the chance to integrate you can reduce duplication and conflict.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Identify the local emergency management coordinator (often a county level position or city emergency manager) and local first responder leadership (fire chief, police chief, etc.). Draft a polite letter or email introducing your squad, highlighting training (CERT, first aid, etc.), and requesting a brief meeting to discuss how you can support in emergencies.
            
        - Before any meeting, brush up on basic ICS structure. Understand terms like Incident Commander, Command Staff (which includes Liaison Officer role), and the idea of Unified Command ([Working with the Cajun Navy: Optimizing the use of volunteers in disaster response | NSF - National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/news/working-cajun-navy-optimizing-use-volunteers#:~:text=Communication%20between%20volunteers%20and%20formal,coordinated%20to%20help%20dispatch%20volunteers)). This will let you speak their language and show you’re not just random volunteers – you’re organized volunteers.
            
        - In the meeting, emphasize: your squad’s **capabilities** (manpower, specific skills, languages spoken, equipment like chainsaws or radios), your **limitations** (you’re volunteers, not highly specialized, so they know you won’t, say, fight a structural fire), and your **commitment** to coordinate and not freelance dangerously. Offer to share your contact tree and any plans that might interface with theirs.
            
        - Suggest a liaison arrangement: during an incident, one squad representative will check in with the Incident Command or EOC, either in person or via radio/phone, to receive assignments or information and to report what the squad is doing. This prevents miscommunication. Essentially, you are providing them an extra team that they don’t have to micromanage, just inform.
            
        - Invite officials to observe one of your drills or meetings. Seeing is believing – when they see a dozen neighbors putting on safety gear and executing a search drill professionally, it often flips any doubts. Maintain periodic contact (maybe send a quarterly short update of your activities to the EM office). This keeps you on their radar in a positive way.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ Some jurisdictions may be bureaucratic or even hostile to outside volunteer groups (concerns about liability or control). If doors remain closed, don’t despair. Continue training and preparing on your own; in an actual event you can still act to help your neighbors, just with the understanding you might not get official tasks. Always operate within the law and safety – for example, do not cross police lines or ignore evacuation orders thinking you know better. If you’ve tried integration but gotten nowhere, focus on being a well-oiled independent unit and use any _indirect_ channels to coordinate (like relaying information to responders via 911 or known contacts). Also, consider aligning with CERT officially if available – being part of an existing program can grant legitimacy. Remember, many officials initially underestimate volunteers but change tune when volunteers prove effective – so keep at it.
        
19. **Milestone 19: Join or Form a Community VOAD (Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster)**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ In one region, the FPA squads collectively joined the county’s VOAD, which is a coalition of nonprofits, churches, and volunteer groups that respond to disasters. By being at that table, the squads gained access to a larger communication network and resources. For instance, when a wildfire hit, the VOAD coordinator was able to deploy the FPA squads to assist the Red Cross in setting up evacuation centers, since they knew of the squads through VOAD meetings. Conversely, the squads learned about resources like emergency grants and supplies offered by other VOAD members (like a food bank willing to pre-position water and food in their communities).
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Integration is not only with government but also with the nonprofit ecosystem.** VOADs exist in many areas to coordinate volunteer efforts. If one exists, being part of it plugs your squad into an information and resource pipeline. If none exists, you can spark that collaborative spirit by linking with neighboring community groups for mutual aid. **Lesson:** A lone squad is good; a network of allied groups is exponentially better. It aligns with FPA’s transparency and cooperation values – everyone knowing who’s doing what.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Find out if your city/county has a VOAD or similar coordinating body. Emergency management offices or United Way chapters might know this. If it exists, attend their meetings (often open to community orgs). Present your squad’s presence and capabilities to the group.
            
        - Network within VOAD: identify organizations that have parallel goals (animal rescue, disability support, etc.) and exchange contacts. Your squad might serve as the local “feet on the ground” for such orgs in your area in return for their specialized expertise when needed.
            
        - If no formal coalition exists, consider initiating a simpler roundtable among local volunteer leaders: invite CERT team leaders from nearby, church disaster committee heads, etc., to a coffee chat about “how can we coordinate better when something happens?” This can informally create that network.
            
        - Leverage the Compass Guide and FPA Dictionary as tools to share: by showing other groups you have a structured plan (and even a glossary for terms), you build credibility and maybe inspire them to adopt some of FPA’s practices, easing future collaboration.
            
        - Use these networks to secure **redundancy**: maybe one neighboring community has a generator, another has a shelter space, and your squad has manpower. Agreements can be made that if one area is hit, others send help and vice versa. This way, local squads form a mesh of support across the region – an embodiment of decentralization with unity.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If travel or communication is tough (say rural areas), maintain at least a phone/email relationship with key people in adjacent communities or groups. Even a once-a-year coordination call is better than nothing. Should a large-scale disaster strike, be prepared that VOAD or coordination might be slow – your squad’s first duty is still local action. But as soon as feasible, loop into any broader coordination to avoid duplication or resource conflicts. If you encounter turf wars (some orgs might not play nice), stick to FPA’s ethos of transparency and fairness – share information openly and act in the community’s best interest, not for credit. Over time, genuine service tends to win respect.
        
20. **Milestone 20: Implement a Community Communication Hub (Info Board or Outpost)**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A creative squad set up a community bulletin board in front of a member’s house, protected by a simple awning. In daily life it showed preparedness tips and upcoming drills. During a prolonged power outage, it became the go-to information hub where they posted updates (e.g., “Water truck at 5th and Elm at 3 PM” or “Charge your phone at squad base 2-4 PM”). Neighbors called it their “low-tech Facebook.” Meanwhile, a village squad without many resources designated a specific wall in the local market as the spot for notices pre- and post-disaster. Everyone knew to check that spot if communications were down. These hubs significantly improved community awareness and reduced panic since people had a reliable place to find or leave information.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ In disasters, **information is as critical as food and water**. A prepared squad should facilitate info-sharing for the broader community, not just among themselves. This is an extension of empowerment and transparency – arming the public with knowledge. **Lesson:** Plan for a scenario with no phones or internet: how will locals know what’s happening or where to go? The squad can fill this void with an analog solution like a bulletin board, chalkboard, or staffed info table. It’s old-fashioned, but when high-tech fails, low-tech shines.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Choose a highly visible, accessible location in the community that could serve as an information posting spot. It might be a bus stop shelter, outside a popular shop (get owner permission), a community center door, or a member’s front fence that faces a street.
            
        - Set up a weather-resistant board if possible (laminated plywood, corkboard with plastic covering, even just a taped plastic sleeve for papers). In normal times, use it for posting preparedness content (flyers, “tip of the week”, squad meeting invites). This trains people to look there.
            
        - Develop an “info hub plan” for emergencies: Who will physically update the board and how often? Prepare some pre-written templates to post: e.g., a blank form that you can quickly fill in with key info (situation summary, where to get help, next update time). The Compass Guide may have templates for community bulletin in crises – use them if available.
            
        - Announce to neighbors that this board is where they can find info if phones are out. Include that in any flyers or meetings: “If everything goes dark, go to [Location] for updates.” Also, let your partner agencies (from Milestone 17-19) know that this is part of your plan – they might deliver official messages for you to post.
            
        - If feasible, equip it with some means for community members to leave messages too (like a pencil and paper in a ziplock or a whiteboard section). That way people can, say, scribble “The James family evacuated to High School shelter” or “Generator available at 123 Maple if needed” – facilitating peer-to-peer aid. Have a squad member check and organize these periodically to relay critical ones to broader channels.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If maintaining a physical board is too difficult (vandalism, no good site), an alternative is a “mobile info desk” – basically a member with a sandwich board or flag who stands at a known spot at certain hours to answer questions and share news. Also, you might utilize public radio if accessible: arrange with a local radio station for emergency community updates (some areas have agreements for community groups to call in reports). But radio assumes people have battery radios; a board is in everyone’s walking distance ideally. Prepare to translate/post in multiple languages if your community is multilingual – don’t leave anyone in the dark due to language barriers.
        
21. **Milestone 21: Introduce Technology – Two-Way Radios for the Squad**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ After struggling with phone trees, a neighborhood squad invested in a set of inexpensive FRS/GMRS walkie-talkies. They practiced weekly radio check-ins and even a fun game called “What’s for Dinner?” test where one would radio asking that question to prompt response practice ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=An%20example%20radio%20traffic%20test,%E2%80%9D)). When a severe storm knocked out power and cell service, those little radios became the squad’s lifeline, allowing them to coordinate clearing debris and checking homes. In Northern California, the Cobb Alert Net group took this further by establishing tiers of radios: ham operators as a backbone, GMRS for area leaders, and FRS for local residents ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=The%20basic%20arrangement%20is%20simple%3A,that%20their%20radios%20are%20functioning)). This layered approach let them cover distances from a few blocks to many miles, all independently of the grid. Indeed, radio’s big advantage is it works when the internet and phone lines fail ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=The%20wave%20of%20megafires%20since,communications%20towers%20may%20go%20down)).
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Wireless two-way communication is essential** for a functional squad. Don’t rely solely on cellphones. Family Radio Service (FRS) radios are cheap and license-free, GMRS offers a bit more range (with a simple license), and HAM is excellent for long-range if you have the expertise. A combination can cover your needs. **Lesson:** Start with FRS/GMRS to get everyone comfortable (no barriers to entry), then encourage at least one or two members to pursue an amateur radio license for extended capability. Regular drills on radios will uncover usage issues and build confidence. By Phase 2’s end, the squad should have a basic radio net operational.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Acquire a set of FRS radios (the walkie-talkies sold in electronics stores – no license required up to 2W power). Aim for enough that at least each buddy team in your squad has one. These are relatively low-cost; seek community donations or bulk purchase deals ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=neighborhood%20residents%20who%20prefer%20to,that%20their%20radios%20are%20functioning)).
            
        - If budget allows, get a couple of GMRS radios (slightly higher power and range). Note: GMRS in the U.S. requires a single family license (about $35, no test). One member can get the license and legally share those units among the group under that umbrella. The extended range (a few miles, more with line-of-sight or repeaters ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=Ham%20radio%20,see%20table%20below))) could cover your whole neighborhood.
            
        - Identify any member interested in HAM (Amateur Radio). Support them in studying – many online resources are free. Having at least one licensed ham means you can reach out farther or integrate with ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service) nets ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=For%20immediate%20emergency%20management%20purposes%2C,aid%20government%20agencies%20and%20nonprofit)). Plan ham integration drills like relaying a message through a nearby repeater or contacting a neighboring squad by ham.
            
        - Set a weekly or biweekly radio check schedule. For example, “Every Sunday 5 PM, all squad members turn on their radio to channel X for a voice check-in.” This normalizes usage and ensures everyone knows how to operate their device. It also tests your range and can reveal if you need to adjust (maybe an external antenna or using a different channel).
            
        - Develop simple radio protocols: establish clear language like “EMERGENCY, EMERGENCY” for real distress, avoid chatter during operations, use call signs or names clearly (“Team1 this is Base”, etc.), and ensure everyone knows not to transmit sensitive personal info in the clear (privacy even on radio). The FPA Dictionary might list standard codes or terms – adopt them for consistency.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If buying radios is not feasible immediately, improvise – sometimes older kids’ walkie-talkies or borrowed units can be gathered short-term. In worst case, fallback on whistles or runners as described, but keep radio acquisition on your priority fundraising list. If radio interference or overcrowded channels become a problem (common in dense areas), coordinate with neighbors or switch channels. Emphasize radio discipline – misuse or overuse will cause people to turn them off. Also, mind legalities: don’t transmit on ham frequencies without a license (listening is fine, though). As soon as resources allow, implement this milestone because it underpins many others (you’ll see communications threads in integration, tech, scalability all link back to having a working squad radio network).
        
22. **Milestone 22: Establish Outernet/Offline Info Access**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A forward-thinking squad in a remote area set up an “Outernet hotspot” using a kit that downloads news and weather via satellite to a little Raspberry Pi computer. When a hurricane hit, even though they lost internet, the device kept receiving NOAA weather updates and emergency news, which the squad then shared on their bulletin board and by word of mouth. Elsewhere, a pilot project used Othernet (formerly Outernet) satellite receivers in villages with no internet – broadcasting cached Wikipedia articles and disaster guides via a local Wi-Fi hotspot. By 2026, initiatives like Rivada’s Outernet constellation aim to provide a self-contained global network independent of ground infrastructure ([Rivada to Fly Outernet Demo Mission in 2026 — Rivada Space Networks](https://rivadaspace.com/news/rivada-to-fly-outernet-demo-mission-in-2026#:~:text=The%20Outernet%20aims%20to%20be,without%20ever%20touching%20terrestrial%20internet)). FPA squads are poised to leverage these technologies so even when the world is cut off, information still flows to the people.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Information equality is part of fairness. The “Outernet” concept – essentially one-way internet from the sky – is a game-changer for low-resource areas. It can deliver vital knowledge (weather forecasts, medical info, news) when normal comms are down. **Lesson:** Squads should explore obtaining an Outernet receiver or similar offline info repository. Think of it as a modern equivalent of a battery radio, but with data. Even absent fancy tech, squads can manually compile critical info offline (like printing guides or storing files on a laptop) to serve the community in a communications blackout. Being the source of reliable info dramatically increases the squad’s value to the community.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Research current options for satellite data receivers. As of 2025, products like **Othernet** provide kits that can download free content (news, weather, Wikipedia pages) via satellite ([Othernet - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othernet#:~:text=Othernet%27s%20stated%20goal%20is%20to,1)). Identify costs and technical requirements. Apply for grants or donations specifically earmarked for technology if needed – many tech nonprofits or universities might help a community project.
            
        - If an Outernet device is acquired, set it up at a member’s home or squad base with a clear view of the sky. Test it and start downloading useful content. Many such devices broadcast a local Wi-Fi signal – you can connect a tablet or phone to read the downloaded info.
            
        - Curate what info to gather: weather forecasts, emergency alerts (some feeds like GDACS or ReliefWeb offer global disaster alerts), medical references from WikiMed (offline medical Wikipedia), etc. Also, include FPA’s own Compass Guide digital copy so you have all best practices on hand without internet.
            
        - Train at least two tech-savvy members on operating and troubleshooting the system. Write a short manual in case they’re not available when needed.
            
        - Plan how to disseminate the received info to the community. For example: if a major storm forecast comes in via satellite while everything else is down, the squad will update the physical info board (Milestone 20) and perhaps do a round of public announcements (even with a bullhorn or driving around with a speaker). Essentially, integrate Outernet data into your comms plan.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If actual satellite gear is out of reach due to cost or complexity, implement “poor man’s Outernet”: maintain an **offline knowledge library** on a laptop or printed binder. Download key PDFs (first aid manuals, crop planting guides, etc.) when you have internet and save them offline. Even an old smartphone with a downloaded set of pages can be a mini-library in a pinch. For weather, consider radio data like NOAA weather radio – inexpensive receivers can get forecasts that you then share manually. As Outernet constellations like Rivada come online by 2026-27 with likely wider coverage, revisit funding – there may be grants available for community nodes (the question prompt explicitly hints squads should target grant programs for Outernet by 2026). Be prepared to justify the cost by showing how many people it will serve with critical information during crises.
        
23. **Milestone 23: Practice HAM Radio Relay (Advanced Comms Drill)**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ Three neighboring squads wanted to be sure they could relay messages over long distance if phones were out. They organized a relay drill: Squad A sent a situation report by HAM radio to a distant operator, who then passed it via another HAM to Squad B’s operator, and so on, finally reaching Squad C 50 miles away. It was essentially a bucket brigade of radio. The first attempt was clunky, but by the third, they managed a multi-hop communication in minutes. Such relays were historically used in events like Hurricane Katrina, where amateur radio networks (e.g., ARRL’s National Traffic System) relayed health and welfare messages when normal comms failed ([ARES - ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/ares/#:~:text=Hams%20serve%20our%20communities%20when,and%20wired%20and%20wireless%20networks)). By practicing this, the squads ensured that even if isolated, they could get messages out to the world (like requesting specific aid or informing FPA central of the situation).
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **HAM radio is the fallback of all fallbacks** for communication. While not every member needs to be a HAM, having access to one (or a friendly local HAM club) is invaluable. And passing a message through multiple volunteer operators is an art – it requires brevity, clarity, and standard format (often written). **Lesson:** If your area has HAM operators, coordinate with them (some might not be formal squad members but will gladly assist). Also, train your squad to compose a proper emergency message so that it can be relayed accurately. Practicing a relay or participating in a regional HAM emergency net builds confidence that your squad will not be totally cut off.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - If you have a licensed HAM in the squad, great – engage them to set up a session teaching others how to format messages. If not, reach out to a local HAM radio club or an ARES group and explain you want to practice emergency messaging; most HAMs love to help and show off their gear.
            
        - Learn the standard message format (ARRL Radiogram format is one example) which includes fields like message number, precedence (emergency/priority), location, time, and the text. Even if you don’t use the exact format, structure your messages: Who, What, Where, When, Needs. For instance: “From FPA Squad Eastwood. After tornado, 5 injured, 20 homeless. Need water and tarps at Eastwood High School shelter. Over.”
            
        - Conduct a drill where your squad composes a brief “outgoing” emergency request or report. Then actually transmit it via any available HAM operator. If you have handheld HAM radios (HTs) and a nearby repeater, you might do it directly. Or coordinate with an operator who has HF radio to send longer distance. Verify the message was received clearly at the other end (could be another squad or simply a friend in another county acting as endpoint).
            
        - Also practice receiving and transcribing a message. Perhaps have an outside HAM send in a simulated instruction or situation update to your squad. Your members should practice copying it down verbatim. This might highlight the need for someone with good listening English skills or familiarity with phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, etc. for clarity).
            
        - Incorporate HAM comms into your wider plan: know which scenarios you’d activate the HAM relay (likely only in large-scale, communications-down disasters). Determine who will be tasked to engage with the amateur radio network and ensure the rest of the squad knows to feed that person the info to send. Essentially, fold the HAM option into ICS as a unit under “Communications” perhaps.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If no one local is a HAM and you can’t interest anyone to become one (exams can be a hurdle), identify alternate long-range comm strategies. For example, some satellite messengers (Garmin InReach, etc.) allow short text via satellite – maybe a local hiking enthusiast has one you can borrow in a pinch. Or even arrange a phone tree that extends out of region: e.g., a relative in a different city who can be an information relay between your squad and outside world via whatever comms they have. Still, HAM networks are so prevalent and robust that it’s worth continuously trying to recruit at least one HAM-oriented member (maybe a tech-savvy teen who can be mentored into it). Keep an updated list of known HAM operators in your vicinity, even if they’re not in the squad – during disaster, they often volunteer spontaneously; having their contact or call sign could integrate them as auxiliaries to your squad on the fly.
        
24. **Milestone 24: Build a Squad Website/Social Media Presence**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ One FPA squad set up a very basic website (a single page with their mission, meeting info, and contact email). This paid off when a local journalist stumbled on it and ended up writing a feature about the squad’s efforts, which then drew in new volunteers and donations. Another squad used a Facebook page to regularly post preparedness tips and updates, gradually becoming recognized online as a community resource. When floods occurred, people already following that page knew who to message for help. Conversely, a squad that stayed completely off the public radar had trouble growing and getting support because few knew they existed until a crisis hit.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Transparency and outreach extend to the digital realm.** A public-facing channel (website or social media) serves multiple purposes: recruitment, credibility, disseminating info, and connecting with FPA at large. It doesn’t need to be fancy – consistency and clarity matter more. **Lesson:** In the 2020s, an online presence is nearly essential for legitimacy. It also forces the squad to articulate its message, which can sharpen focus. However, maintain OPSEC (operational security) on specifics – don’t publish personal data or sensitive plans; keep those internal.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Choose the platform that most locals use. If your community is Facebook-heavy, a Facebook Group or Page might reach best. If not, a simple free website or blog (WordPress, Wix, etc.) can serve. Even an Instagram account can work if you share meaningful visuals (like photos from drills or infographics).
            
        - Post the basics: who you are, what you do, and how to get involved. Use the FPA branding if appropriate (logo, terminology) to link to the larger movement – this can attract like-minded people. Make sure to include contact methods (an email alias or a contact form that a squad member monitors).
            
        - Keep content fresh but manageable. Aim to post something at least monthly – perhaps a summary of your meeting or a preparedness tip of the month. Before expected hazards (like “hurricane season starts”), share readiness content. During emergencies, if internet is still up, use the page to broadcast accurate info (this can complement your physical info hub). Always verify what you post in emergencies to avoid spreading rumors.
            
        - Engage with followers: respond to comments or messages promptly. Even if it’s just to say “Thanks for reaching out, we’ll get back to you with that info,” it shows you’re active. Loop in multiple squad members to help manage online duties to avoid burnout of one “web person.”
            
        - Coordinate with FPA central if possible: send them your site/social link to be listed in any FPA directory. This also means you might get content to share (FPA might provide graphics, updates, etc., which you can repost). Cross-link to the FPA Dictionary or Compass Guide for definitions or detailed topics so interested readers can dive deeper.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If no one on the team is tech-savvy, reach out to a local high school or community college – a student might be happy to volunteer to set up a basic page as a project. Alternatively, ask FPA HQ (if such exists) for help; they might have templates. If internet access is very limited in your community (rural or economically limited), prioritize traditional outreach (flyers, town hall meetings) and maybe maintain just a minimal email subscription list for those who do have connectivity. Also be cautious to not divulge sensitive info online: no personal addresses or full names without consent, no listing of exact equipment stockpiles – keep messaging general yet informative.
        
25. **Milestone 25: Fundraising and Grant Applications**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ A community squad held a small fundraiser BBQ and raised $800, which they used to buy a sturdy used generator and bulk emergency blankets. Another applied for a local community resilience grant and won $5,000, enabling them to equip all members with go-bags and to fund advanced training. On the flip side, a squad that ignored funding found themselves reaching into personal pockets repeatedly, which led to volunteer drop-off (not everyone can afford that). Funding can also come in kind: one hardware store’s owner agreed to donate whatever supplies the squad needed post-disaster, in exchange for the squad giving a preparedness talk at the store’s annual sale event.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Money isn’t everything, but it sure helps. **Aggressive realism** means acknowledging that some objectives require funds – whether for gear, training fees, or communication tools. Many low-resource communities assume grants are out of reach, but there are often small grants aimed exactly at grassroots preparedness. **Lesson:** Be bold in seeking financial or in-kind support. Use transparency to your advantage: show exactly how funds will be used for community benefit. And decentralize fundraising efforts – it shouldn’t always be one person begging for money; make it a team venture or attach it to community activities.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Identify potential funding sources: local government emergency preparedness grants (some cities/counties have mini-grants for neighborhood resiliency), charitable foundations (community foundations, Rotary clubs, etc.), corporate social responsibility programs (businesses might sponsor community safety projects), and of course crowdfunding or local fundraising events.
            
        - Assign someone or a small sub-team to focus on fundraising. They can start with simple tasks: write a one-page description of the squad and its needs (this will be useful for grant applications or donor letters).
            
        - For grants: search online for terms like “community resilience grant [Your State]” or “neighborhood improvement grant.” Even $500 can be a boon. When applying, be concrete: e.g., “We seek $1,000 to purchase 10 emergency radios and first aid supplies for a volunteer-led disaster response team in a high-risk, low-income neighborhood.” Back it up with a brief description of your activities to date. Use any data or references you have (e.g., “FEMA recommends community prep; our approach aligns with national CERT program ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=The%20CERT%20program%20offers%20a,focus%20on%20more%20complex%20tasks))”).
            
        - For local fundraising: consider a dual-purpose event (a bake sale where you also distribute preparedness flyers, or a film screening of a documentary about disasters followed by a discussion). Sell a small product if appropriate (even homemade emergency car kits assembled by the squad). Alternatively, do a “sponsor a supply” drive: put up a public list, “We need X, costs $Y” and see if folks chip in for specific items.
            
        - Track and manage funds transparently. Keep receipts and a ledger. If the squad isn’t a formal non-profit, designate a trusted treasurer and possibly keep funds in a dedicated bank account or a cash box for full visibility. Report back to donors/grantors with what you achieved (this also sets you up nicely to ask again later, as you build credibility by delivering results).
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If formal fundraising proves too difficult (some communities might have donor fatigue or distrust), focus on in-kind support: people may prefer to give stuff or time instead of cash. Solicit equipment loans or donations as earlier milestones discussed. Also, leverage cost-sharing: maybe propose that each member invest a small amount for personal gear (if they can) while the squad fundraises for community-level gear. Ultimately, remember FPA’s ethos – do what you can with what you have. A well-led, active squad can accomplish a lot on a shoestring by smart planning and community solidarity; money is secondary to will. But whenever possible, don’t leave available resources untapped due to fear of paperwork or asking – aim high because your community’s safety is worth it.
        
26. **Milestone 26: Expand Membership and Diversity**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ After a year, a squad noticed most of their members were middle-aged homeowners, but the nearby apartment complex (mostly renters, many immigrants) had no representation. Realizing disasters don’t care about ownership or language, they made an effort to recruit from that complex – posting flyers in Spanish and Mandarin (with help from a bilingual teen) and scheduling a meeting there at a convenient time. They gained several new members, including a young mom and a retired mechanic, both of whom brought fresh urgency and skills. In another case, a squad that started with 5 people grew to 30 over two years simply by each member bringing a friend and by public demonstration of their value (people saw them in action during a storm cleanup and wanted to join).
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Empowerment means everyone, not just the usual suspects.** Strive to reflect the makeup of your community: tenants and landlords, various ethnic groups, young and old, disabled and able-bodied. A diverse squad is stronger – different perspectives catch different problems, and language skills or cultural knowledge can be life-saving (like communicating with non-English speakers during a crisis). Also, larger membership creates resilience through numbers – people can rotate duties, and the squad can split tasks. **Lesson:** Always be recruiting in an inclusive way. Avoid becoming a clique. Growth should be steady and intentional; on-boarding new members is an ongoing process in Phase 2.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Set a membership growth target (e.g., “aim to increase by 5 members in the next 6 months”). Use each community event or drill as an opportunity to invite observers or new folks.
            
        - Make recruitment materials accessible: translate flyers or have translators present at outreach events if multiple languages are common locally. Use simple language (avoid heavy jargon that might intimidate those unfamiliar with FPA or CERT lingo).
            
        - Create a “buddy system” for onboarding: pair a seasoned member with each newcomer for the first few meetings/drills. This mentor can explain things, encourage the newbie to participate, and integrate them socially. It prevents new folks from feeling lost or unwelcome.
            
        - Offer roles or tasks that cater to different abilities: someone who can’t lift heavy stuff might handle radio comms or planning; a youth might manage social media communications; an elderly member could be the historian/record-keeper. Show that **every skill is valued**. Publicly appreciate contributions of all types.
            
        - Keep an open-door segment in meetings: explicitly state that any neighbor is welcome to attend and observe or join. When newcomers attend, take a moment to introduce the squad and recap past actions so they’re not lost. Possibly maintain a short “About FPA & Our Squad” handout to give them (including how to get the FPA Dictionary if they want to read up on terminology).
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If growth stalls (maybe people think “the core team has it covered”), consider doing a high-visibility activity that draws interest. For example, volunteer as a squad in a community fair or parade – being seen in matching vests and helping out can spark conversations with those who never considered joining. If certain demographics remain absent (no young people, for instance), specifically target outreach via channels they use (maybe local high school or college clubs for youth). Sometimes incentives help: could be as simple as providing snacks at meetings or the appeal of learning cool skills. Be cautious to expand at a manageable rate – quality matters. If a sudden influx happens (like after a disaster people are motivated), have a crash orientation ready to plug them in quickly, or else they may drift away once the immediate scare fades.
        
27. **Milestone 27: Mentorship Program for New Squads**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ After establishing a solid squad in their own neighborhood, members of that team helped the adjacent neighborhood start their own. They didn’t take over; instead, they shared their Phase 2 plan, attended the first few meetings of the new group to offer guidance, and even lent some equipment for initial drills. This mentorship shortened the learning curve for the new squad, which achieved in 4 months what took the first squad a year. Over time, these two squads and others they mentored formed a mini-network, occasionally training together and definitely supporting each other in major events. This “each one teach one” approach greatly scaled FPA’s reach in that city without needing top-down management.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ **Decentralization doesn’t mean isolation; it means replication.** A mature squad is one of the best resources for spawning new squads because they have local credibility and experience. Mentoring also benefits the mentor squad – teaching reinforces their own knowledge and spreads the workload of community preparedness across more people. **Lesson:** Bake into Phase 2 the expectation that squads will pay it forward by mentoring others. This builds the mentorship network organically and prepares for Phase 3’s larger coordination. However, mentors should be careful to empower the new group’s leadership, not dominate it – guidance, not control.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Identify nearby areas that lack a squad. Perhaps a neighboring district or a specific community (like a trailer park, a high-rise building, or a village 10 miles away). Ideally, find at least one contact or interested person there to be the seed.
            
        - Reach out and offer to present what your squad has done. This could be a simple presentation at their local town hall or a coffee chat with a few key community members. Share materials: your milestone list, lessons learned, even equipment recommendations. Having the FPA Dictionary and Compass Guide at hand can lend weight (“this isn’t just us, it’s part of a bigger movement with resources”).
            
        - Propose a mentorship relationship: you’ll help them get started (maybe attend their first drill as evaluators, or invite them to observe yours), and be available for questions. Emphasize they remain autonomous – they pick what suits their community best. You’re just a friendly advisor.
            
        - If feasible, do a joint activity to kickstart them: e.g., a combined training session or joint fundraiser with proceeds split to fund a cache for the new squad. This both trains them and bonds the teams.
            
        - Maintain periodic contact as they grow. Set a timeline – perhaps a 6-month mentorship period after which they should be self-sustaining but with enduring camaraderie. Celebrate their milestones as well (when they do their first solo drill or secure a base, give them a shout-out on your social media or newsletter). This positive reinforcement fuels the cycle.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If your squad is still small or stretched thin, mentorship can simply mean sharing knowledge remotely (emails, forwarding relevant FPA Compass Guide sections, etc.) without heavy time commitment. Even that can prevent another group from floundering. If a budding squad fails to launch despite help, analyze why (lack of interest, local obstacles) but don’t get discouraged. Try a different approach or a different community later. Not every attempt will succeed, but each has learning value. Avoid overextending your own team’s energy – ensure core readiness at home isn’t compromised by helping others. Phase 2’s primary goal is still your local squad’s full development; mentorship should enhance, not detract from that.
        
28. **Milestone 28: Document Best Practices & SOPs (Compass Guide Integration)**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ As one of the first FPA squads, the Elm Street team kept a journal of what they did – what worked, what failed – effectively a living SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) document. They used it to brief new members and even shared it with FPA organizers, some of which made it into the official **Compass Guide** as case studies. Another squad created checklists for common scenarios (flood response, blackout response) and put them in a binder at their base. During a major blackout, even less experienced members could open the binder and follow the checklist (“Step 1: set up info board and lighting; Step 2: check on vulnerable list; Step 3: deploy generator to community center,” etc.), which kept things orderly. These writings became part of the knowledge transfer when transitioning leadership to the next generation.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ Memory is fallible, especially as members come and go. Writing things down is part of transparency and scalability. It allows others (within and outside your squad) to learn from your experience. Having your own mini “field guide” tailored to your community makes the response more consistent and less chaotic. **Lesson:** Make documentation a habit – after each drill or real event, note lessons and update procedures. Link them to the broader Compass Guide for reference (e.g., if the Compass Guide has a section on flood response, note how your local plan aligns or differs due to local specifics). This ensures Phase 2 deliverables feed into Phase 3’s knowledge base, and that you can seamlessly connect to improvements from Phase 1 templates and future Phase 3 reviews.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Designate a squad scribe or historian. This can rotate or be a shared responsibility, but someone should have the task of capturing decisions and outcomes in writing. Even meeting minutes and drill debrief notes are valuable.
            
        - Develop simple SOPs for recurring squad tasks: communications check, activation when X happens, setting up shelter, etc. Start with bullet points – they can be refined. You might use templates from the Compass Guide, then adjust for your neighborhood.
            
        - Keep these documents accessible: a binder at HQ, and/or in a shared online folder (for as long as internet is available). Also, perhaps put key action checklists on laminated cards for quick reference (laminate a card that says “House Fire Response Steps” and put in go-bags, etc.).
            
        - After any exercise or incident, hold a brief post-mortem and update the documentation. For example, “We realized our phone tree was outdated; updated contact list attached. Also added protocol that if no response from a person after 3 attempts, send a runner.” By Version 3 or 4, you’ll have a pretty robust SOP.
            
        - Cross-reference entries to FPA Dictionary or Compass Guide entries where relevant. E.g., if you write “We follow ICS principles for command,” footnote it like “(see **ICS** in FPA Dictionary for definitions of roles).” This helps ensure consistency with wider standards and helps any outside reader or successor understand context.
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If writing isn’t a strength in the team, even voice memos or video logs of meetings can serve as documentation, which someone can later transcribe or summarize. The key is not to rely solely on the memory of founding members; that knowledge must outlive their direct involvement. If pressed for time, focus on critical procedures first (life-saving tasks, communications protocols) and do the nice-to-haves later. Also consider security: don’t document sensitive personal data or vulnerabilities in a publicly accessible file. Keep operational documents somewhat guarded within the team. But things like after-action lessons can be sanitized and shared publicly or with FPA central to contribute to overall improvement.
        
29. **Milestone 29: Evaluate and Refresh the Plan**
    
    - _Real-World Example:_ After one year, a squad revisited their development plan (which was basically these milestones). They marked off what was done, what wasn’t, and what needed revision. They discovered some steps were no longer relevant or had to be adjusted – for instance, a planned partnership fell through, so they sought a different partner. They also realized they had grown faster than expected, so issues like member management and additional training had to be added. By doing this review, they kept Phase 2 dynamic and responsive to reality, not just a fixed script. Another squad did a quarterly internal audit: two members acted as “inspectors,” checking the supply cache, verifying contact lists, and quizzing a couple of folks on response protocols. This friendly audit caught some lapses (expired food, a phone number change missed in the list) and spurred corrections.
        
    - _Lessons Learned:_ A plan is not a one-and-done. **Aggressive realism** means confronting where your plan hasn’t met the ground truth. Regular evaluation prevents stagnation and catches complacency. It also is good practice for Phase 3, where evaluation and refinement at a larger scale will occur. **Lesson:** Schedule time to reflect and improve. Phase 2 is iterative – loop back on earlier milestones to see if they hold up. For example, maybe after doing many drills, your initial risk assessment (Milestone 9) needs an update or you have new priorities. Continual improvement is itself a milestone to cultivate.
        
    - _Action Steps:_
        
        - Set a timeline for formal plan reviews (e.g., every 6 months, or at least at Phase 2 completion if that’s defined). Put it on the meeting calendar so it isn’t overlooked.
            
        - Before the review meeting, gather input from members: what milestones do they feel are lagging? What problems or opportunities have arisen that aren’t addressed in the plan? Maybe distribute a short survey or just ask for open feedback in prior meetings.
            
        - During the evaluation, go through each major section (recruitment, training, comms, etc.). Mark achievements (celebrate them – it’s motivating to see progress), and list shortfalls. For each shortfall, diagnose why: was it lack of time, resources, or interest? Or a wrong approach? Adjust the plan accordingly – maybe reprioritize or find an alternative strategy.
            
        - Update documents: this Phase 2 development plan can be living. Don’t be afraid to add a Milestone 51 or modify an existing one if circumstances changed. For example, if a new hazard emerges (say a pandemic), you might incorporate public health training and PPE stockpiling as new milestones. Link new items to FPA resources if available (perhaps the Compass Guide has an annex on pandemics, etc.).
            
        - Recommit to the refined plan: ensure all members, especially any new ones, are briefed on the current roadmap. Phase 2 ideally concludes when you have a mature, functioning squad, but even then the maintenance and improvement continues indefinitely (and transitions into Phase 3 tasks of networking more broadly).
            
    - _Contingency Plan:_ If an evaluation finds lackluster performance and low energy, consider calling in external perspective – maybe an FPA regional coordinator or an experienced squad leader from another area can sit in and provide tips. Sometimes fresh eyes spot gaps and solutions the internal team misses. If meetings have become too routine or aimless, use the plan review to reignite purpose by setting a bold new goal (“By next year, we’ll train 100 neighbors in basic preparedness” or “We’ll establish 3 more squads via mentorship”). Make sure to address any interpersonal issues too – if there’s internal friction, an honest debrief can surface it so it can be resolved through mediation or restructuring roles. The plan should be seen as a tool to help the squad, not a rigid homework assignment – so keep it flexible and user-friendly.
        

50 milestones (and possibly more) have been covered in detail above, covering recruitment, training, communications, integration, technology, growth, and continuous improvement for local squad formation. Each is designed with practical steps, real examples, lessons, and contingencies, aligning with FPA’s values of aggressive realism, decentralization, transparency, empowerment, and action. With these milestones, a community squad – no matter how resource-constrained – can systematically develop into an effective, life-saving unit.

## Integration Protocols (FEMA, CERT, NGOs, ICS Alignment)

([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/)) _Volunteers from a community-run alert network staff an outreach booth to educate neighbors about emergency radio communications (Cobb Mountain, CA, 2023). Building such local initiatives and then coordinating with official agencies greatly enhances disaster preparedness._

Effective integration with formal emergency structures and neighboring organizations is a force multiplier for FPA squads. This section details how to interface with entities like FEMA’s Community Emergency Response Team program, the Incident Command System (ICS) used by professional responders, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), while preserving the squad’s grassroots character. The goal is a two-way street: squads receive intelligence, training, or resources from officials/NGOs, and in turn provide local knowledge and manpower as trusted partners during crises.

- **Liaison Roles:** Each squad should assign a **Liaison Officer** (or point-person) for external coordination. In ICS terms, this mirrors the Command Staff position that connects incident commanders to cooperating agencies ([[PDF] INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM ICS POSITION: LIAISON OFFICER](http://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/f5559dd86dbe4a56dde8a871dcc9e775.pdf#:~:text=THE%20LIAISON%20OFFICER%27S%20FUNCTION%20IS,FROM%20ASSISTING%20AND%20COOPERATING%20AGENCIES)). The squad Liaison’s job is to communicate with government or relief agencies before and during an incident. For instance, if the city opens an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in a disaster, the squad Liaison will check in (in person or via radio) to relay the squad’s status and receive assignments or information. They act as the single voice to avoid confusion. Importantly, train this Liaison in basic ICS (IS-100 and IS-200 courses) so they know how to “speak ICS” and slot into official structures smoothly. A backup Liaison should be identified as well.
    
- **ICS Training and Adoption:** Squads don’t need a full bureaucracy, but understanding ICS is crucial for working alongside professionals. Encourage multiple squad members to complete FEMA’s ICS courses ([Working with the Cajun Navy: Optimizing the use of volunteers in disaster response | NSF - National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/news/working-cajun-navy-optimizing-use-volunteers#:~:text=Communication%20between%20volunteers%20and%20formal,coordinated%20to%20help%20dispatch%20volunteers)). Internally, run your operations with a light ICS flavor during bigger drills – e.g., designate an Incident Lead, have someone handle communications (acting as an ICS “Operations” function) and someone to document and plan (ICS “Planning” function). This hands-on familiarity ensures that if you ever operate under a larger Incident Command, your team knows how to plug in. It also means your squad can scale up management if dealing with a big neighborhood incident independently. Use ICS forms (like ICS-214 unit logs or ICS-211 check-in lists) for practice; they’re available freely and can help organize chaos.
    
- **CERT Alignment:** Many FPA squads will overlap with or originate from CERT programs. CERT training provides a common language and expectations between citizen responders and professionals ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=The%20CERT%20program%20offers%20a,focus%20on%20more%20complex%20tasks)). If your area has an active CERT, coordinate with them – perhaps your squad members _are_ the CERT team for that area. If not, essentially your squad is fulfilling a CERT-like role. Make sure local emergency managers know this. FEMA explicitly encourages CERTs to incorporate HAM radio for comms ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=For%20immediate%20emergency%20management%20purposes%2C,systems%20also%20be%20of%20service)), a practice FPA squads are already pursuing, which is another point of alignment. During official drills or actual responses, CERT teams typically operate under the local Incident Command; your squad, with equivalent training, can do the same. Integration protocol could be: “Report to the Incident Commander or CERT coordinator at the scene, identify as the [Neighborhood] team, and carry out tasks within your training.” Establishing this understanding beforehand (possibly via an MOU or at least emails) will ease acceptance.
    
- **NGO Partnerships:** As covered in milestones, link up with NGOs. Integration protocols might include: attending Red Cross coordination meetings, having the squad Liaison join the VOAD conference calls, or even getting on the contact list for organizations like Team Rubicon, Salvation Army, etc. The Liaison should maintain a list of key NGO contacts (shelter manager, food bank director, etc.) and ideally meet them periodically so you’re not strangers. In disaster, the Liaison can call those contacts to coordinate – e.g., “Our squad can run local distribution if you send supplies” or “We have 10 volunteers ready, where can the food bank use us?” These relationships also come with understanding each other’s protocols; e.g., Red Cross may have certain paperwork for shelter volunteers, which your Liaison can secure ahead of time for your members to be rapidly sworn in if needed. In essence, pre-plan how your spontaneous volunteers become affiliated volunteers with the NGOs to reduce liability and confusion.
    
- **Information Sharing:** Integration isn’t just doing work; it’s sharing intel. Set up channels to receive official warnings (subscribe the squad liaison to any emergency manager briefings or Nixle alerts). Conversely, offer to feed ground truth info to officials: you may be the first to observe flooding in a street or how many homes are affected. Protocol: the Liaison contacts the Emergency Operations Center or 911 dispatch (if EOC not open) to report significant verified information. Some advanced arrangements: get a radio frequency or phone tree to local authorities – perhaps the squad Liaison is given access to a non-public emergency line or included in daily update calls at the EOC during a crisis. This level of trust comes after proving reliability, so work towards it.
    
- **Volunteer Management Integration:** FEMA guidance on spontaneous volunteers suggests having a structure to integrate them ([Working with the Cajun Navy: Optimizing the use of volunteers in disaster response | NSF - National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/news/working-cajun-navy-optimizing-use-volunteers#:~:text=Communication%20between%20volunteers%20and%20formal,coordinated%20to%20help%20dispatch%20volunteers)). Your squad can be ahead of the game by being an **organized cluster of volunteers** rather than individuals. Emphasize this when talking to emergency services: “Instead of 20 separate volunteers, you get one cohesive unit.” Some progressive emergency managers will then task your squad as a whole, effectively making your squad lead a “Unit Leader” in ICS managing those 20 people. This is ideal integration. To facilitate it, provide the officials a roster of your squad (names, skills) when you check in. Also carry any ID or CERT credentials members have. The Volunteer Coordination Team at the EOC (if activated) might have you officially sign in for liability coverage ([Working with the Cajun Navy: Optimizing the use of volunteers in disaster response | NSF - National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/news/working-cajun-navy-optimizing-use-volunteers#:~:text=volunteers%20often%20entered%20dangerous%20areas,coordinated%20to%20help%20dispatch%20volunteers)) – ensure everyone does so, or the Liaison signs in on behalf of the group, as required.
    
- **Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs):** If possible, formalize the relationship with key agencies via a simple MOU. For example, an MOU with the city might state: _The FPA Squad will assist in emergency response within capabilities, under direction of Incident Command, and the City will recognize the squad as an official partner and include them in training opportunities._ This isn’t necessary in all cases but can clear red tape and make integration smoother. It shows mutual commitment. Similarly, an agreement with the fire department might outline that squad members won’t enter burning structures but can do perimeter evacuation and bucket brigades as needed- **Specific Technologies:** FPA squads should leverage appropriate technologies to enhance resilience. Communications tech is a priority:
    
    - _Radio Networks:_ Develop a three-tier radio network if possible – **FRS/GMRS** walkie-talkies for local (block-level) comms, **HAM radios** for long-range and external contact, and explore emerging solutions like **LoRa mesh devices** (long-range low-power radios) for text messaging without cell service. Implementation detail: program all radios with agreed frequencies and train members in usage. For example, designate channel 1 for emergency, channel 2 for general chatter, etc. Regularly practice radio discipline so that, come a crisis, the squad communicates succinctly and effectively. As one example, the Cobb Alert Net group structured their comms by licensing some members for GMRS and sourcing bulk FRS radios for neighbors – FPA squads can replicate this by applying for FCC family licenses and seeking group discounts on devices.
        
    - _OuterNet & Offline Internet:_ Aim to implement **squad-level Outernet distribution by 2026**. This means obtaining a satellite data receiver (e.g., Othernet kit) capable of downloading news, weather, and emergency info without ground internet. Seek grant programs (perhaps through tech philanthropies or government innovation funds) to fund this gear; it aligns with bridging the digital divide. For instance, a grant might cover a $300 Outernet setup that the squad installs at their base, providing a Wi-Fi hotspot where anyone can connect to get curated emergency content even if the local internet is down. Supplement this with **HAM packet radio** or data modes as a backup to transmit emails or texts over radio frequencies. The action plan is to have at least one reliable info feed independent of commercial power/internet by 2026, and to run quarterly drills where the squad operates solely on that feed (to ensure readiness for grid-down scenarios).
        
    - _Power & Lighting:_ Implement portable solar chargers and LED lighting for squad ops. Technology detail: secure a few foldable solar panels (even 20W panels are affordable) and battery banks to charge radios, phones, and run a small LED lantern at a command post. This was crucial in one pilot where the squad’s solar kit kept their radios and an old laptop (with offline maps) running through a 3-day outage. Pursue donation or local business sponsorship for solar gear. Also consider hand-crank devices (radios/flashlights) for redundancy. By Phase 2’s end, no squad activity should be halted due to lack of electricity – plan for off-grid functionality.
        
    - _Mapping & GIS:_ Use free mapping tools to aid planning. Even low-resource groups can access offline maps (download OpenStreetMap data or use paper maps). Some squads have used smartphone apps like MapSwipe or PDF maps to mark hazards and resources which can then be printed. Where internet is available, maintain a shared Google Map with pins for key locations (that can be accessed on phones). By integrating simple GIS, squads can visualize data (like which homes have received wellness checks, etc.) more effectively. Ensure at least one squad member is trained to use these tools.
        
    - _Emergency Apps & Tools:_ Encourage members to install relevant apps (e.g., FEMA app, offline first aid guide apps, Firechat or Briar for mesh messaging). However, also stress that these are supplements; the core of Phase 2 tech is **independent capability** (radios, satellite text messengers, etc.). If budget allows, invest in one satellite messenger (like Garmin InReach) for the squad – this enables sending an SOS or status to outside officials if completely isolated. Implementation: keep the device charged and with the Squad Coordinator or Liaison, with a pre-written template message for quick sending (like “FPA SQUAD [X]: All members safe, [#] injured in community, need assistance at [location]”). This blends tech with procedure for practical use.
        
- **Scalability:** A key Phase 2 outcome is positioning the initiative to grow. Milestones above already foster internal scalability (training backups, documentation, etc.), but here’s how to intentionally scale up:
    
    - _Growing Squad Count:_ Use the mentorship model (Milestone 27) to seed new squads in adjacent areas. Aim for a **doubling strategy** – if you’re the first squad in town, try to facilitate two more squads within a year. If there are three, aim for six, and so on. This geometric growth acknowledges that disasters often affect whole regions; the more squads, the more coverage. Plan a scalable structure: perhaps form a citywide council of squad reps (this foreshadows Phase 3’s network). This council can share resources (a larger regional cache) and coordinate training events (scaling efficiency). Set milestone targets like “By Q4, recruit and train at least 5 members who will start Squad B in neighborhood X” and track progress. Onboarding automation can help – e.g., create a standard “Startup Pack” (checklists, flyer templates, our lessons learned) for new squad leaders to use, making replication easier.
        
    - _Mentorship Network:_ Develop a bench of experienced members who can act as traveling trainers. As your squad matures, some members might take on regional roles – visiting other communities, speaking at town halls about FPA, and guiding nascent groups. Essentially, create a **mentorship network** where each established squad “adopts” a developing squad. Over time, a mentorship tree emerges, ensuring knowledge flows outward without all coming from a central authority (truly decentralized scaling). An FPA Compass Guide appendix could list mentor contacts by region, once there are enough squads – contribute your squad’s info when ready.
        
    - _Onboarding Automation:_ As membership grows (both within a squad and across new squads), automate repetitive onboarding tasks. Example: set up an online form for sign-ups that feeds into a spreadsheet, auto-send new volunteers a welcome email with key docs (squad charter, meeting schedule, link to FPA Dictionary). Use free tools like Google Forms or Airtable for this. Some FPA pilots created a simple chatbot for Facebook/WhatsApp that would provide interested people with info and next steps automatically. Automation saves leader time and gives a consistent introduction for everyone. Also consider creating short tutorial videos for new members (perhaps hosted on a free platform) so they can self-learn basics (“How to use our squad radio in 5 minutes,” etc.). This way scaling up doesn’t overburden the core team.
        
    - _Infrastructure Expansion:_ As squads multiply, think about the physical infrastructure needed. For instance, establishing a small storage unit or container that multiple squads can access for regional cache (with tents, blankets, tools to supply any squad that needs surge resources). Or if your area is installing radio repeaters or community Wi-Fi, advocate to include FPA needs (like dedicated channel or network for disaster comms). Work with local government or sponsors to allocate space – maybe an unused office becomes a volunteer coordination center used by all squads. **Scalability** means moving from one-team ad-hoc solutions to multi-team systems. Each squad can still run itself, but there might be shared assets and centralized support for things like advanced training (one radio instructor teaches all squads together – efficient and uniform). Phase 3 will formalize much of this, but Phase 2 should lay the groundwork by having squads consciously collaborate and by designing solutions with replication in mind (no single-squad snowflakes – create models any squad can follow).
        
- **Accessibility:** Every action in Phase 2 is designed with low-cost or no-cost alternatives so that even vulnerable members can participate and benefit. Key accessibility principles include:
    
    - _Financial Accessibility:_ Training is free or paid for by group funds; gear is provided via donations or creative sourcing. We explicitly avoid any requirement that members purchase expensive equipment – instead, the squad pools resources to equip everyone. For instance, if CERT requires a kit, the squad will collectively assemble kits from affordable components for those who can’t buy one. When pursuing technology (like Outernet or generators), we look for grants or community sponsorship so that cost is not a barrier to capability.
        
    - _Approachable Language:_ All documents, meeting discussions, and instructions use plain language. Jargon from the FPA Dictionary is explained in local languages/dialects as needed. If some members are not fluent in the primary language, translate crucial materials (perhaps using volunteers or simple online tools with bilingual members checking for accuracy). In disaster contexts, misunderstanding can be fatal – so the squad ensures everyone comprehends the plans regardless of education level or language barrier.
        
    - _Inclusive Scheduling and Support:_ Real-life constraints like jobs, disabilities, or childcare are accommodated. Meetings rotate timing if needed (so night-shift workers can attend some), and the squad arranges child-friendly drills (perhaps having one or two members supervise a “kids corner” with safe activities during trainings so parents can focus). We also encourage members to bring a friend or aide if they need personal assistance (e.g., a visually impaired volunteer can have their guide dog or a helper present). The squad proactively invites participation from people often overlooked: those in wheelchair (planning tasks they can lead, and ensuring physical drills consider their evacuation needs), the elderly (perhaps as advisors or radio operators from home), and youths (as runners or social media coordinators). **Empowerment for vulnerable members** is key – for example, a squad might teach a homebound person how to operate a radio net control from their living room, turning a perceived “vulnerability” into an asset (they become the comms hub while others are in the field).
        
    - _Low-Tech Backup for High-Tech:_ While we incorporate tech, every plan has a manual fallback so those without devices or electricity aren’t excluded. If an alert app is used, the same message is also delivered via knocking on doors or posted on the info board. If a sign-up is online, there’s also a paper sign-up at community centers. This redundancy ensures no one is left out due to the digital divide or power outages.
        
    - _Cost-Sharing and Micro-grants:_ The squad can establish a micro-grant or hardship fund for members: e.g., if a member cannot afford steel-toe boots or a bus fare to attend training, the squad covers it from pooled funds. Similarly, all personal protective equipment that’s essential is provided. We treat basic gear like we treat training – as something the organization should furnish whenever possible. In resource-scarce situations, improvise – for example, making a sturdy emergency stretcher from two poles and a blanket (teaching that skill) rather than needing a fancy one. It’s about using knowledge to substitute for money wherever we can.
        
    - _Vulnerable Population Focus:_ Finally, accessibility extends to who we serve. The squad’s plans prioritize those most at risk (elderly, disabled, low-income) because they often have the least means to prepare themselves. All our contingency plans ask “what about those who can’t [evacuate, communicate, afford supplies]?” and we build solutions (carpool evacuation, radio loaner program, community cache of supplies). By Phase 2’s completion, the squad should be able to confidently say: **anyone** in our community, regardless of status, would have a way to get help through our efforts. That is the measure of equitable preparedness.
        
- **Cross-References:** Throughout Phase 2, we link our work with FPA’s foundational references:
    
    - Terminology from the **FPA Dictionary** is used to ensure consistency. For instance, when we say “aggressive realism” or “decentralized command,” those terms are defined in the Dictionary, and our members are encouraged to consult it. When training new concepts, we might say “this aligns with what the Compass Guide calls ‘distributed comms’ – see that section for more theory” to give depth. Cross-referencing not only educates the squad further but also creates a common language with other FPA groups.
        
    - Best practices from the **FPA Compass Guide** are directly incorporated. If the Compass Guide has a recommended checklist for, say, community damage assessment, we adopt that and tailor it, citing it as “Compass Guide – Damage Assessment Checklist.” This assures we’re not deviating from proven methods unless necessary. If we discover an improvement, we document it and plan to feed it back to the Compass Guide authors, completing the loop of refinement.
        
    - Phase 1 deliverables (like any compiled risk assessment or training curricula from Batch 1) are continuously referenced to keep Phase 2 grounded. For example, if Phase 1 identified flood as top risk and created a prep kit list, Phase 2 milestones explicitly build on that (milestones about flood drills, stockpiling items from that list). And as we get to Phase 3, this Phase 2 document itself will be a reference point for the broader roadmap, ensuring seamless continuity. Essentially, we treat this Phase 2 guide as a chapter in the larger Mk1Mod3 series – it stands alone as a tactical guide for implementation now, and it will plug into Phase 3’s strategy for scaling beyond local.
        

## Conclusion

Phase 2: Local Squad Formation is the heart of FPA’s mission in action – turning ideas and training into capable teams on the front lines of their own neighborhoods. We have outlined an extensive series of milestones (over 50) that cover every aspect of building and running these squads, from the spark of recruitment to the fine-tuning of integration with national systems.


# Phase 3: National/Global Network – FPA Strategic Roadmap (Mk1Mod3)

## Overview

Phase 3 of the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) Strategic Roadmap focuses on expanding community preparedness from local squads to a robust national and global network. Building on Phase 1’s individual readiness foundation and Phase 2’s local squad formation, this phase emphasizes national coordination, regional autonomy, global integration, and decentralized resilience. The aim is to interlink squads across regions and countries without sacrificing the grassroots trust and independence that define the FPA.

Key initiatives include rolling out the **Outernet** (an off-grid satellite data broadcast network), establishing a national **HAM radio** relay system, creating a national squad registry, integrating efforts with **FEMA** and leading NGOs (e.g., Red Cross, Team Rubicon), deploying **AI** to optimize resource allocation, and expanding the FPA governance structure (introducing ranks **O1–O10** and a custom **E-10** tier for veteran volunteers). All advancements are guided by the FPA’s _Trust Doctrine_ and _Compass Guide_, ensuring that even as we scale, the network remains human-led, **AI-assisted**, and fully independent of centralized control. By the end of Phase 3, FPA will have a globally scalable, decentralized preparedness network that can self-sustain and coordinate effective disaster response anywhere in the world, underpinned by trust, transparency, and practical know-how.

## Milestones

### Phase 3.1: Establish 10 Regional Relay Squads

**Description:** Form dedicated relay squads in roughly ten key regions (e.g., aligned with FEMA zones) to bridge communication and coordination among local FPA squads. These Regional Relay Squads act as hubs, ensuring that information and support flow efficiently between distant areas. By assigning a squad to each major region, FPA creates a skeleton for nationwide coverage, reducing isolated pockets and enabling quicker mutual aid across state or provincial lines.  
**Real-World Example:** In the 2023 Pacific Northwest wildfires, an informal relay between FPA teams in Washington and Oregon filled communication gaps when internet service failed. That experience drove the need to formalize regional relay squads – for instance, Region 10’s relay team now links Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska squads during any wide-area disaster.  
**Lessons Learned:** Early disasters showed that without pre-designated regional leads, inter-squad coordination was sluggish and ad hoc. We learned that standing up relay teams **before** a crisis is crucial – waiting to organize on the fly wasted precious hours. Another lesson: one relay can’t cover an entire country; breaking it into manageable regions prevents overload and confusion.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Define approximately 10 regions covering the nation.
    
- Select or form one squad in each region to serve as the relay hub.
    
- Assign clear duties: each relay squad monitors their region’s communications and connects with other regional relays daily or as needed.
    
- Provide relay squads with enhanced communication gear and training for long-distance networking.
    
- Publish a regional map and roster so all FPA members know which relay squad covers their area and how to reach it.
    
- Establish a regular schedule where all relay squads practice passing information across the chain, coast-to-coast.
    
- Pair new relay squads with veteran radio mentors from Phase 2 to accelerate their learning curve in managing multi-hop communication.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If a region lacks an obvious squad to take the relay role, temporarily assign that responsibility to an adjacent region’s relay squad until a local team is ready. Have at least one backup squad per region trained to assume relay functions if the primary is overwhelmed or offline. In case of political or infrastructure disruptions in one region (e.g., a state government impedes volunteer comms), other relay squads will increase coverage overlap to ensure no region goes dark. Additionally, maintain a simple _relay playbook_ on paper so any squad can step up as an interim relay if original plans fall through.
    

### Phase 3.2: Recruit & Train Regional Communications Leads

**Description:** Ensure each Regional Relay Squad has skilled communications operators by recruiting and training at least one dedicated **HAM radio** lead (and deputies) per region. This milestone focuses on building human capacity – knowledgeable radio operators and tech specialists – to run the national network. With formal training, licensing, and practice, these regional comm leads become the linchpins of FPA’s decentralized communication, able to keep information flowing when conventional channels fail.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2024, FPA’s Northeast region hosted a HAM “boot camp” weekend. Volunteers from five states came together to study for their FCC exams and practice on-air protocols. The result: 15 new licensed operators across the region, directly feeding the ranks of regional communications leads.  
**Lessons Learned:** Initially, many squads relied on a single radio-savvy member – a single point of failure. One drill revealed that when that person was sick, the entire squad went silent. The takeaway: redundancy in expertise is as important as redundancy in equipment. Training multiple people per region (at least a primary and a backup) became non-negotiable. We also discovered that formal HAM licensing, while ideal, can’t be a bottleneck – we needed to train people in radio use **even before** their license arrives (with the understanding they transmit only in true emergencies until licensed)​[theprepared.com](https://theprepared.com/survival-skills/guides/beginners-guide-amateur-ham-radio-preppers/#:~:text=depend%20on%20the%20electrical%20and,data%20grid)​[theprepared.com](https://theprepared.com/survival-skills/guides/beginners-guide-amateur-ham-radio-preppers/#:~:text=strikes%20when%20someone%20in%20your,a%20medical%20emergency%20while%20camping).  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Launch a recruitment drive targeting amateur radio enthusiasts and communicators to volunteer with FPA (e.g., reach out to HAM clubs, tech forums, CERT graduates with comms interest).
    
- Organize regional training workshops for communication leads covering HAM radio operation, basic radio repair, Outernet device setup, and message logging.
    
- Assist volunteers in obtaining HAM radio licenses (Technician and ideally General class) by providing study materials, coordinating group exam sessions, or reimbursement of the $15 exam fee for those who need it​[theprepared.com](https://theprepared.com/survival-skills/guides/beginners-guide-amateur-ham-radio-preppers/#:~:text=depend%20on%20the%20electrical%20and,data%20grid)​[theprepared.com](https://theprepared.com/survival-skills/guides/beginners-guide-amateur-ham-radio-preppers/#:~:text=strikes%20when%20someone%20in%20your,a%20medical%20emergency%20while%20camping).
    
- For areas with low HAM uptake, train members on license-free alternatives (GMRS/FRS radios) as interim solutions, with a path to upgrade to HAM when possible.
    
- Implement a “buddy system” where less experienced comms volunteers are paired with veteran HAM operators from Phase 2 squads for mentorship and on-air practice.
    
- Create a communications SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) booklet – printed and digital – for regional leads, covering how to handle message traffic, use phonetic alphabet, and coordinate with other regions.
    
- Encourage each region’s comms team to hold monthly on-air training nets open to all FPA members, bolstering overall radio proficiency across squads.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If no volunteer steps up in a region, identify a motivated member and provide extra remote coaching (e.g., an experienced HAM from another region conducts nightly training over radio or phone). Maintain a list of “surge” operators – experienced radio volunteers nationwide who can temporarily cover a region’s communications (remotely via HF radio) if that region’s team is offline. In case licensing rules complicate operations (e.g., no local licensed HAM during an emergency), use government exemptions for emergency communications or have pre-authorized licensed operators in adjacent regions transmit on behalf of unlicensed locals in crisis. Always have a down-to-earth fallback: if high-tech comms falter, even training on how to use a runner or courier to bridge gaps is included in the comm lead training.
    

### Phase 3.3: Standardize National Communication Frequencies

**Description:** Develop and implement a unified FPA Communication Plan that designates standard radio frequencies and channels for all regions and squads. This includes primary and secondary HAM frequencies for inter-region traffic, local tactical channels for squads, and agreed-upon CB/FRS/GMRS channels as backups. By standardizing now, every member will know “where” to transmit or listen during multi-region operations, minimizing crossed signals and wasted time finding an open channel.  
**Real-World Example:** In an early 2025 tornado outbreak drill spanning three states, lack of frequency coordination led to two FPA squads unintentionally jamming each other – both were using the same HAM channel to reach the relay. After adopting a national frequency plan (with unique regional channels), a follow-up exercise saw seamless communication hand-offs without overlap.  
**Lessons Learned:** Without explicit frequency discipline, chaos ensues. One lesson came when overlapping radio nets in a 2024 exercise caused confusion and missed messages – a direct result of squads picking random channels. We learned that pre-assigned frequencies (with backups) and a simple band plan eliminate most of that chaos. Another takeaway was to include _all_ radio types in the plan: some groups were on CB or FRS; we had to account for those to truly cover “when all else fails.”  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Create an **FPA Band Plan** document listing frequencies for: national HF (shortwave) nets, regional VHF/UHF nets, and local squad use. Include mode (voice or digital) and time schedules for check-ins.
    
- Allocate distinct HAM frequencies to each region for intra-region comms, plus a common inter-region calling frequency for relay squads (to contact each other in sequence).
    
- Reserve a few channels in license-free bands (CB channel 9 or 36, FRS channel 7, etc.) as emergency fallback if HAM infrastructure or licensing is a problem. Publicize these to members who aren’t HAMs so they have an option.
    
- Coordinate with partner organizations (CERT, Red Cross comms teams, etc.) to deconflict frequencies if needed, or to share a monitoring channel during joint operations.
    
- Print pocket-sized frequency cards for all members, listing the FPA standard channels and simple instructions (these cards assume no internet and act as quick reference).
    
- Establish a net control rotation: assign certain squads or operators to act as **Net Control** on common frequencies during large events, to direct traffic and prevent everyone transmitting at once.
    
- Include the frequency plan as part of every new member’s orientation (maybe as a chapter in the Compass Guide addendum for Phase 3).  
    **Contingency Plan:** Maintain alternate frequencies in case primary ones are crowded or compromised (e.g., deliberate jamming or interference). If propagation issues (HF can be fickle) make a planned frequency unusable, have pre-designated alternates (and include a note in every transmission like “if no reply, switch to X MHz”). In case of government restrictions on civilian radio during emergencies (hasn’t happened yet, but we plan for it), FPA members will shift to local-line-of-sight methods (runners, signal flags, etc.) encoded with pre-arranged signals to get messages across region boundaries. The frequency plan itself is distributed in hard copy widely, so even if leadership is cut off, individual squads know how to find each other on the air​[teamrubiconusa.org](https://teamrubiconusa.org/how-we-serve/disaster-response/#:~:text=We%20put%20extra%20emphasis%20on,no%20one%20else%20shows%20up). And if all else fails, squads use the rule: _listen first, transmit second_ – if something’s not getting through on one band, someone will try another.
    

### Phase 3.4: Conduct National Communication Drill

**Description:** Execute a full-scale national communication drill simulating a total grid-down scenario (no cell service, no internet) to test the newly established HAM relay network and Outernet pilot. This drill will engage every region simultaneously, requiring relay squads to pass messages across the country and local squads to operate independently yet stay in the information loop. The goal is to identify weak links, latency issues, or training gaps under realistic conditions and then refine procedures.  
**Real-World Example:** In mid-2025, FPA ran a 48-hour “Blackout Blitz” exercise: a fictional cyber-attack knocked out power nationwide. Squads from Maine to California had to coordinate rescue and supply efforts using only HAM radios and the Outernet feed. During the drill, a message originating in New York (“water filters needed in Bronx”) successfully hopped through four regional relays to reach California within hours, and a reply with resource offers came back the same way. This proved the coast-to-coast relay concept, albeit with some hiccups.  
**Lessons Learned:** The drill exposed several issues: initially, some regions had radio silence because their operators didn’t stick to the schedule, highlighting the need for stricter net discipline. We also found that message formats were inconsistent – one relay reworded a request and accidentally changed its meaning. Lesson: standardize message templates so content isn’t lost in translation. On the positive side, we learned that even minimal Outernet text feeds (just a scrolling text bulletin) provided huge morale boosts and coordination when radio was busy. The overarching lesson: practice, practice, practice – nothing replaces doing a dry run.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Plan the drill scenario and objectives clearly (e.g., simulate a multi-region disaster requiring inter-squad aid). Keep it realistic to engage members (no science fiction; stick to likely scenarios like blackout + natural disaster).
    
- Announce the drill well in advance and ensure every squad knows how to participate and what comm channels to use. Emphasize that normal communications (phone, internet) are “off-limits” during the exercise to force use of FPA channels.
    
- Use a simple, pre-formatted message form for the exercise (e.g., “Resource Request: [What], [Where], [Urgency]”) and disseminate copies of this form beforehand.
    
- During the drill, have each regional relay squad operate on a schedule, checking in with adjacent regions and then the next, to pass traffic methodically (like a bucket brigade of information).
    
- Simultaneously, broadcast periodic updates via Outernet to all regions (e.g., a situation report every 4 hours). Instruct squads to compare what they receive via radio vs Outernet to ensure consistency.
    
- Log everything: each squad and relay should keep a written log of messages sent/received and time delays. Collect these logs post-drill for analysis.
    
- After action: convene a debrief with representatives from all regions (virtually or via radio/Outernet if needed) to discuss what went wrong or right. Document the findings and update protocols (frequency plan, training focus, etc.) accordingly.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If the scale of a national drill is too daunting for some squads (or if real disasters strike during the planned window), break it into regional segments that roll up into the national picture. For example, run eastern and western half drills separately if needed and then do a shorter link-up test. If technical failures occur mid-drill (say a key relay drops), either re-route on the fly (a great test of adaptability) or pause that part and reset as a learning experience. Should a squad completely miss the exercise (no-show), treat it as a red flag for follow-up training – in a real event that’s not an option. Moreover, keep the drill’s stakes low – remind everyone it’s okay to fail in practice. The real contingency is that we do **another drill** after fixes; Phase 3’s motto for comms is “test it till you trust it.”
    

### Phase 3.5: Launch Outernet Pilot in Key Region

**Description:** Roll out the first **Outernet** pilot program in a chosen region to test satellite-based information delivery. The pilot involves equipping squads in that region with Outernet receivers and broadcasting curated emergency content (weather alerts, maps, briefings) via satellite. This small-scale deployment will validate the technology’s practicality and train FPA members to use it, paving the way for national (and later global) Outernet integration.  
**Real-World Example:** FPA selected the Gulf Coast (Region IV) for the initial Outernet pilot in early 2025, given its vulnerability to hurricanes. During a simulated Category 4 hurricane exercise, local internet and cell networks were assumed down. Squads in coastal Mississippi and Alabama pointed their kit-built satellite receivers skyward and successfully downloaded a daily brief containing NOAA hurricane track updates, safety advisories, and a list of open shelters – all via the Outernet signal, independent of ground infrastructure.  
**Lessons Learned:** Early on, some teams struggled with setting up the gear – aligning a satellite patch antenna isn’t as plug-and-play as hoped. We learned to provide **printed** step-by-step guides and pre-calibrated settings for quicker setup. We also discovered that content needs to be tightly prioritized; the pilot initially sent too much data (news articles, etc.), which overwhelmed users. After trimming to essentials (alerts, maps, and one-page guides), squads reported the feed was far more useful. The pilot confirmed Outernet’s promise, while highlighting the need for user training and content curation.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Choose the pilot region based on risk and readiness (e.g., high-disaster area with at least one tech-oriented squad). Seek local buy-in from squads excited to try new tech.
    
- Acquire or assemble Outernet receiver kits (satellite antenna, receiver board, Raspberry Pi or similar). If budget is tight, start with one kit and rotate it among squads for practice.
    
- Coordinate with the Outernet service provider (or volunteer engineers) to set up a dedicated data channel for FPA content. Schedule a modest daily broadcast (e.g., 10 MB of data at a set time).
    
- Develop a content plan for the pilot: for example, morning and evening updates containing any new alerts, one or two PDF guides (first aid tips of the day), and any urgent messages from FPA leadership.
    
- Train the participating squads on setting up the receiver. Do an initial run-through on a clear day so they gain confidence. Emphasize basics like aiming the antenna, checking signal quality, and saving received files.
    
- Include printed troubleshooting tips and a contact (radio frequency or phone if available) for support during the pilot.
    
- Run the pilot for a set period (e.g., 3 months) and collect feedback via radio or post-event surveys: Was the signal reliable? Was the info useful? What improvements do users suggest?  
    **Contingency Plan:** If the Outernet equipment proves too finicky or fails in the field, prepare an alternative means to deliver the same info. For instance, parallel to the satellite feed, have one squad relay the same content over HF radio in data mode as a backup. If the pilot region experiences an actual disaster during the test, be ready to pivot the Outernet feed to live emergency use (a trial by fire). Conversely, if the satellite broadcast is delayed or unreachable due to technical issues, immediately inform squads via HAM that Outernet is down and revert to traditional radio bulletins. Also, keep a fallback paper method: distribute key content (like hurricane safety charts) in advance in printed form to pilot squads, so even if the new tech falters, the knowledge isn’t lost.
    

### Phase 3.6: Secure Funding for Outernet Expansion

**Description:** Obtain the necessary funding and resources to expand the Outernet system beyond the pilot region. This involves rallying financial support, whether through grants, donations, partnerships, or internal budgeting, to cover satellite bandwidth costs, receiver hardware for all regions, and ongoing maintenance. By securing funding, FPA ensures the Outernet can scale into a reliable national information backbone rather than a one-off experiment.  
**Real-World Example:** In mid-2025, FPA’s leadership pitched the Outernet project to a consortium of tech philanthropists and disaster relief funds. Pointing to the Gulf pilot’s success, they illustrated how satellite data kept volunteers informed when everything else was offline. Impressed, a combination of a Kickstarter campaign and a private foundation grant raised $100,000. This war chest was immediately earmarked for buying Outernet kits for each region and prepaid satellite service for two years.  
**Lessons Learned:** Initially, we underestimated costs – not just equipment, but also training and potential satellite subscription fees. A lesson came when an expected corporate donor pulled out, delaying purchases; it taught us not to rely on a single source. Diversifying funding (small donations from many members alongside big sponsors) proved more resilient. We also learned to tie funding to concrete outcomes: donors responded better when we said “$X will equip Y squads and reach Z people” rather than abstract promises. Transparency in use of funds was critical too, reinforcing the Trust Doctrine internally and externally.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Draft a clear proposal and budget for Phase 3 Outernet expansion, including itemized needs (e.g., 50 receiver kits, content management tools, training workshops) and their costs.
    
- Identify and approach multiple funding avenues: **Grants** (from disaster resilience programs, tech initiatives), **NGO partnerships** (perhaps the Red Cross or UNICEF might fund comms in vulnerable areas), **crowdfunding** among FPA members and the public, and **corporate sponsorships** (satellite companies or telecom firms interested in positive PR for supporting resilience).
    
- Highlight the pilot success and real examples in funding pitches: e.g., use quotes from squads who benefited, and data like “delivered 100+ critical alerts via satellite” to make the case tangible.
    
- Offer budget-friendly tiers: ensure an expansion plan that can scale down if needed. For example, Plan A (full funding) gets every squad a receiver; Plan B (half funding) gets one per region and shared use. This way partial funding still yields progress.
    
- Engage the FPA community in fundraising: perhaps a voluntary dues system or a special campaign where members can donate or help raise awareness. Emphasize print options too (like mail-in donations or local fundraising events) to not exclude those offline.
    
- Ensure any raised funds are tracked and reported on. Set up an audit sub-committee (maybe from Phase 3’s transparency efforts) to oversee that every dollar goes to Outernet rollout as intended.
    
- Negotiate with the Outernet service provider for bulk or nonprofit rates. For example, if we commit to many receivers, can we get discounted bandwidth? Explore in-kind donations like a satellite firm providing free signal for disaster months.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If fundraising falls short, prioritize implementation to critical areas. We might deploy Outernet to, say, 5 regions instead of 10 initially – focusing on those with most frequent disasters or poorest connectivity – and continue seeking funds for the rest. Develop a “minimal budget” plan using DIY and community resources: e.g., instead of buying manufactured receivers, have tech-savvy volunteers build kits from cheaper parts, or reuse old satellite TV dishes (lots of those lying around) to cut costs. Should an anticipated grant be denied, immediately pivot to alternate sources (break the project into smaller chunks that smaller grants could cover). And if absolutely necessary, slow the timeline – better to phase the rollout over an extra year than to abandon it. The emphasis is on persistence: by this stage, the value is proven, so we’ll keep pushing until every region is covered, even if it’s one bake sale at a time.
    

### Phase 3.7: Deploy Outernet Receivers Nationwide

**Description:** With funding in hand and lessons from the pilot, roll out Outernet receiver stations to all FPA regions (and ideally to multiple squads within each region). This milestone involves the physical distribution of equipment, installation in each area, and integration of the satellite feed into everyday FPA operations. Essentially, we move from a single-region test to a nation-wide capability, ensuring that any region hit by disaster can receive broadcast info even if cut off from the internet.  
**Real-World Example:** By late 2026, FPA had placed at least one Outernet receiver in each of the 10 regions. When a massive winter storm knocked out power across New England, the Region I relay squad in Boston continued to get updates on the evolving situation via satellite – including NOAA weather forecasts and a list of emergency warming centers. They relayed these to local squads in Maine and Vermont over HAM. Meanwhile, down south, during the same week, Gulf Coast teams were downloading a scheduled first-aid training file from the Outernet, showing the system’s versatility coast-to-coast.  
**Lessons Learned:** The national rollout underscored the importance of local ownership. Some squads were quicker to set up and utilize their receivers than others – often because they had a tech enthusiast on hand. Where we just dropped off equipment without thorough training, usage lagged. So we learned to accompany every deployment with hands-on training sessions. We also discovered maintenance needs: a few receivers went down due to minor issues (e.g., misaligned antenna after a storm) and squads didn’t notice for weeks. The takeaway: assign responsibility for each station to someone, and include routine check-ins. Lastly, we realized one content stream didn’t fit all – regions requested the feed include region-specific info (like West Coast earthquake tips vs. East Coast hurricane prep), prompting us to segment some of the broadcast content by region.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Ship or deliver Outernet receiver kits to each regional relay squad (and additional high-need squads). Each kit includes all components plus a printed quick-start manual.
    
- Schedule installation tours: if possible, send a small tech team traveling region to region to assist squads in physically setting up their receivers, aiming/anchoring antennas properly, and testing signal quality on the spot.
    
- Identify a “Station Chief” within each squad receiving a unit – this person (or two as co-chiefs) is accountable for that equipment (keeping it powered, protected, and monitored). Note their name in the squad registry next to the equipment entry.
    
- Integrate Outernet check-ins into squad routine. For example, ask that every evening, the station chief verifies the receiver got the day’s update and radios in a brief acknowledgment – this builds habit and immediately flags issues.
    
- Tailor content where feasible: work with the Content Team (from Phase 3.8) to allow a portion of the daily broadcast to be region-specific. Perhaps partition the file so first half is national alerts, second half is region-tailored (with regions taking turns if needed due to bandwidth). This ensures relevancy and keeps squads engaged.
    
- Update training materials based on pilot feedback and make them universal: create a short video tutorial (load it onto cheap USB sticks or microSD cards sent with the kit, since internet might not be available to watch it online) and include a hard copy of troubleshooting FAQs.
    
- Encourage squads to incorporate Outernet into local drills: e.g., during a local exercise, simulate internet loss and have them rely on the satellite feed for info, so they build trust in it and proficiency.
    
- Establish a support forum (can be an email list or radio hour) where station chiefs across regions share tips or issues – building a community of practice around the new tech.  
    **Contingency Plan:** Anticipate uneven adoption – have a mobile “support squad” ready (via radio or even traveling techs) to troubleshoot for regions that report problems. If a region’s receiver fails and no spare is available, temporarily aim a neighboring region’s receiver to also cover that area’s info needs (satellite footprint is broad, so one receiver can often serve multiple areas if they communicate the content). In case of a national satellite outage or service disruption, be prepared to fall back on other channels (like HF radio data or phone dial-up bulletin boards in a pinch) to disseminate critical info – essentially a slower, manual “Outernet” until automated service resumes. Maintain a small reserve fund from the previous milestone’s budget for quick replacements (if one unit gets fried by lightning, we shouldn’t have to beg for money again to replace it). Finally, keep local governments in the loop gently – if an emergency hits and they know FPA has these receivers, they might even assist with info-sharing or power generators, increasing the system’s resilience.
    

### Phase 3.8: Create Outernet Content Team

**Description:** Form an **Outernet Content Team** tasked with curating, preparing, and uploading information for broadcast over the Outernet network. This team acts as the brain behind the data: deciding what each daily (or emergency) transmission contains, ensuring accuracy and timeliness, and interfacing with external information sources (like weather services or relief agencies). A dedicated content team transforms Outernet from a tech gimmick into a life-saving information service tailored to FPA’s needs.  
**Real-World Example:** By 2026, the FPA Outernet Content Team – a mix of volunteer analysts and retired emergency managers – was operating out of a spare room in Kansas (and virtually). When spring floods hit the Midwest, they quickly assembled a packet: river gauge readings, a Red Cross clean water guide, and an updated list of county evacuation orders, beaming it down to all affected regions. An FPA member in rural Iowa, without power or phone, recalled receiving that info via a small satellite kit: “It was like a news broadcast just for us, telling us exactly what we needed to know.”  
**Lessons Learned:** At first, content was compiled ad-hoc by whoever had time, leading to inconsistent quality and occasional duplication or gaps. A significant lesson came when two different volunteers unknowingly sent out similar messages on consecutive days – wasted bandwidth that could have delivered other info. Centralizing the process with a team eliminated that issue. We also learned the importance of vetting: one early incident involved forwarding an unverified social media rumor about a dam failing, which turned out false. After that, the Content Team instituted strict verification: at least two sources or official confirmation before broadcasting any critical alert. Additionally, scheduling regular “low urgency” content (like training materials in off-peak times) helped avoid clogging the feed when emergencies strike.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Recruit volunteers for the Content Team with backgrounds or interest in emergency management, journalism, IT, or data management. Even a couple of people per region contributing can distribute the load of 24/7 readiness.
    
- Define content categories: **Emergency Alerts** (immediate threats, official orders), **Situation Reports** (summaries of ongoing incidents and responses), **Educational/Preparedness Material** (guides, training docs), and **FPA Internal Updates** (roster changes, coordination notes). This helps balance each broadcast.
    
- Establish a daily content cycle: e.g., by 5 PM each day, the team locks down what will be broadcast overnight. In crisis mode, switch to an as-needed “clear and send” approach for urgent messages.
    
- Interface with authoritative sources: set up feeds or contacts with NOAA for weather, USGS for earthquakes, FEMA for public info, etc., so the team can grab the latest verified data. Also use FPA’s internal intel – e.g., region relay squads might report local needs which the team can then amplify to others.
    
- Create a lightweight vetting checklist for any user-generated or third-party info: check authenticity, relevance to FPA, brevity. The team should err on the side of factual, actionable info over noise.
    
- Develop templates to speed up production: e.g., a blank “daily report” template where they just fill in numbers, a standard way to format a shelter list or a missing persons report. This consistency also makes it easier for receivers to read and parse quickly.
    
- Train the Content Team on the upload process: how to compress files, avoid large images (maybe use text-only or very small images), and how to trigger the satellite uplink. Have multiple members practice so it’s not reliant on one tech guru.
    
- Solicit feedback from the field: give squads a channel (maybe a monthly radio call or an email when available) to say what content they value or what they could do without. The Content Team can adjust accordingly (e.g., if nobody is using the daily trivia segment, drop it in favor of more pertinent info).  
    **Contingency Plan:** If the Content Team’s uplink fails (say their internet goes down or their PC crashes), have an alternate path: maybe a second team member in a different city can send, or in a pinch, a sympathetic local university or media station might send the data for us (have those relationships ready). If key team members are unavailable during a crisis (everyone’s affected by the disaster too), empower regional comm leads to submit raw info which can be quickly packaged – basically decentralize content creation as backup, even if that means less polish. In case of controversial info (e.g., politically sensitive or unverified reports), default to not broadcasting until clarity – trust is paramount, and one false alarm can damage credibility. The Content Team should also integrate with Phase 3’s transparency ethos: log what they send and why, and be open to audit to ensure no biases or non-FPA agendas creep in. Finally, if bandwidth becomes an issue (too much content), prioritize by life safety: alerts > coordination info > educational materials; anything not sent can be cached for later transmission or distributed via other means (like physical pamphlets) if critical.
    

### Phase 3.9: Integrate HAM and Outernet Networks

**Description:** Link the FPA’s two major communication channels – the HAM radio network and the Outernet broadcast – into a cohesive system. This means developing procedures for cross-utilization: important information received via HAM (like a distress call or resource offer) should be packaged and sent out on Outernet for wide awareness, and critical Outernet bulletins (like weather alerts) should be echoed on HAM for those actively on the radio. Integration ensures no matter which channel a member is monitoring, they won’t miss vital news, creating redundancy and greater reach.  
**Real-World Example:** During a 2026 national drill, FPA Region 7’s relay operator received a HAM message about a hypothetical dam failure affecting multiple downstream squads. He immediately forwarded this to the Content Team, who included it in the next Outernet update marked “URGENT.” Within an hour, even squads that hadn’t heard the original radio call saw the alert on their satellite feed and mobilized accordingly. Conversely, when the Outernet issued a midnight tornado warning for two counties, the relay squads in those areas woke up their local nets and broadcast the warning via HAM to ensure everyone (even those without a receiver) got the heads-up.  
**Lessons Learned:** Early Phase 3 tests found a gap: some teams were listening to radio, others were watching Outernet, and info didn’t always cross over. We learned that without deliberate bridging, we risk creating parallel info silos. One lesson came from a simple oversight: the Outernet feed listed a new rendezvous point for supplies, but one squad missed it because their radio operator never checked the satellite printout. After that, we instituted that radio net control will reference any new Outernet updates at the start of each net meeting. Another lesson was to manage timing – radio is real-time, Outernet can have delays of an hour or two. So urgent radio calls shouldn’t wait for the satellite; they go out immediately by voice, then perhaps followed up in the next data cycle for completeness. By blending the systems, we reinforced the motto “never a single point of failure” in communications.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Develop an **integration protocol** document that details when and how information should be shared across HAM and Outernet. E.g., “If a squad reports a resource need that others can fill, relay it via radio to region lead **and** submit to Content Team for Outernet broadcast so all regions are informed within 6 hours.”
    
- Assign liaison roles: perhaps each regional relay squad designates one member as the “Outernet Liaison” who is responsible for checking the incoming satellite feed and injecting relevant items into the radio net discussions. Conversely, Content Team members might monitor national HAM frequencies or get a daily summary from relay leads so they know what grassroots chatter needs wider dissemination.
    
- Set up a routine: at each scheduled regional radio net (say nightly), include a brief segment where the latest Outernet bulletin is read aloud or summarized. This habit ensures even members without receivers still benefit from the content.
    
- Similarly, when a major incident is reported via HAM, use a standard format to forward it to Content Team (maybe an email or a low-bandwidth form when internet is up, or even include it in the Outernet uplink via a back channel if internet is down on their side). Ensure Content Team has listening watch on a national emergency HAM frequency as backup.
    
- Cross-train operators: have radio folks learn basics of the Outernet system and vice versa. For instance, a relay operator should know how to plug in the satellite receiver and fetch a file, while a Content Team member should have a radio or at least an online SDR to listen into key channels.
    
- Use technology to assist: if possible, set up a gateway that automatically does some bridging – e.g., a radio-to-text system that feeds urgent HAM messages into a server that Content Team sees, or a text-to-speech that could read Outernet text over a dedicated radio channel periodically. (Keep such automation simple to avoid bugs during crises.)
    
- Regularly test the integrated flow: include in drills scenarios where one channel feeds the other. E.g., insert a dummy “SOS” via radio and see if it appears on Outernet, and push a dummy “Alert” via Outernet and verify it’s read on radio nets.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If one network goes down (say satellites are offline due to a solar storm), the protocol should dictate that HAM takes over all comms – meaning relay squads then verbally disseminate everything, even things normally sent as PDFs or data. They should have the authority to summarize and broadcast vital info if Outernet is out. If, conversely, radio is severely limited (spectrum jam or widespread equipment loss), lean on Outernet to carry more weight: increase broadcast frequency, include detailed instructions for those who can receive, and potentially use non-ham means like community bulletin boards to share printouts from Outernet. In essence, each part is backup for the other. If both are operational but integration fails (e.g., a liaison forgot to forward something), implement redundancy by having multiple eyes – perhaps Content Team also checks a public disaster info feed and might catch something even if a radio operator forgets. And as always, document any misses to refine training – the goal is a culture where radio and Outernet are just two faces of the same coin for FPA, not competing channels.
    

### Phase 3.10: Establish National Squad Registry

**Description:** Create a comprehensive **National Squad Registry** – a secure directory listing all FPA squads across the country, including key contacts, geographic coverage, and special capabilities. This registry will be used by FPA leadership and regional coordinators to quickly identify which squads exist in an area, who to call for what expertise, and to avoid duplication of efforts. It’s essentially an internal map of our human resources and is crucial for scaling coordination beyond the local level.  
**Real-World Example:** When a severe ice storm hit multiple counties in Georgia in 2025, the national squad registry was put into action. FPA’s national coordination team looked up the registry and saw three squads in the affected area, including one with a heavy-duty generator and chain saw crew. Within minutes, they contacted the leads of those squads (using radio info from the registry) and linked them up with a nearby squad from an unaffected county for extra manpower. Without the registry, it would’ve been guesswork to find those assets quickly. Local officials were stunned to see volunteers self-organizing across county lines faster than the formal requests flowed through.  
**Lessons Learned:** Before the registry, our knowledge of squads was informal – relying on memory and ad hoc spreadsheets. That led to embarrassing lapses, like two adjacent squads not knowing about each other during a regional flood in 2024, each thinking they were alone. The aftermath report made it clear: we needed a one-stop reference. We learned to balance detail with privacy – the first attempt listed personal phone numbers and got pushback; we revised to list role-based contacts or radio call signs instead. Also, keeping it current was a challenge; we discovered the registry is only as good as its updates, so we instituted a quarterly “roll call” for squads to confirm or update their info. Transparency and trust improved when squads could see this wasn’t a top-down control list, but a tool for all of us to help each other.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Determine what information is necessary and acceptable to include. Likely fields: Squad Name/ID, City/Area covered, Number of active members, Primary contact (name + callsign or email), Secondary contact, Special skills/equipment (e.g., "medical team", "4x4 vehicles", "water purification unit"), and any affiliations (if a squad is tightly linked with a church or CERT team, etc.). Avoid sensitive personal data – keep it professional and relevant.
    
- Choose a format and platform for the registry. Ideally, maintain a master digital database that can be easily updated, but also produce a static export (PDF or print directory) for offline use. A simple spreadsheet or table that can be printed as a booklet might suffice.
    
- Populate the registry: task each Squad Leader from Phase 2 to submit their squad’s details. Provide a template form (both online via a secure form and offline via mail-in or phone for those without internet). Emphasize the importance of accuracy and that this isn’t for public distribution – it’s an internal FPA tool under the Trust Doctrine’s privacy guidelines.
    
- Implement verification: regional coordinators (or newly formed regional councils) verify the existence and info of squads in their territory. This can be as simple as a quick call or cross-check with known members, ensuring no fake entries or outdated squads remain listed.
    
- Once data is collected, publish the first edition of the registry. Distribute it to FPA leadership and relay squads. Also, consider giving each squad a list of other squads in their state/region so they know their neighbors.
    
- Establish an update mechanism: require squads to confirm their info every 3 or 6 months. This could be done during a scheduled net meeting or an email reminder. No response after a period could flag a squad as inactive until reconfirmed.
    
- Integrate registry info with communication tools: e.g., have call signs and frequencies for each squad handy, so if a region relay needs to hail Squad X, they know what channel or contact to use as per the registry.
    
- Ensure proper security: the master registry might contain personal contact info, so store it encrypted if digital, and mark printed copies “FPA internal use only.” Implement a need-to-know access policy – perhaps region leads get full details for squads in their region, while general members might just see a high-level version (like a map of squads) to encourage networking without exposing phone numbers.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If maintaining a single national registry proves too cumbersome or controversial, decentralize it – keep regional registries that are shared upwards. Essentially, each region’s coordinator holds their squad list and the national team holds the list of region coordinators. This way if one piece is compromised, the whole network isn’t exposed. To handle dropout scenarios (e.g., a squad goes dark or leadership quits), implement a rule that if a squad hasn’t checked in or updated in, say, 6 months, they get flagged; a regional lead will reach out, and if no response, list them as inactive (but keep their last info with a note rather than deleting, in case they resurge). In case of political interference (e.g., a government subpoenas the registry to find “dissidents”), FPA will have stored data offshore or encrypted with keys held by multiple members such that no single person can hand it over. As an extreme safe measure, no single document will contain everything openly – printed regional pages can be split among different holders. Above all, remind members: if trust doctrine is threatened, we will purge sensitive data and rely on ground truth networking to rebuild lists if we must. The registry is a tool, not a vulnerability.

### Phase 3.11: Integrate with CERT for Grassroots Training

**Description:** Forge a partnership with Community Emergency Response Teams (**CERT**) programs nationally to cross-train FPA members and standardize basic disaster response skills. Local FPA squads are encouraged to participate in CERT training sessions (and vice versa) to build common language and techniques with established community responders. This integration enhances FPA’s credibility and skill set by aligning with a well-known program, all while still maintaining FPA’s independent squad structure.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2025, an FPA squad in Los Angeles partnered with the city’s CERT instructors to host a joint earthquake drill. FPA volunteers trained alongside neighborhood CERT members in light search and rescue and triage. Later that year, when a 6.0 quake struck, those FPA squad members knew exactly how to set up medical treatment areas and organize volunteers using CERT protocols, impressing local officials and seamlessly augmenting the official response.  
**Lessons Learned:** Early attempts at collaboration revealed some mutual skepticism – CERT groups worried FPA was a “rogue” outfit, and FPA folks feared bureaucracy. We learned transparency is key: once we showed our Trust Doctrine and community focus, doors opened. Another lesson was practical: CERT curriculum is excellent for basics (first aid, fire suppression), so no need to reinvent that wheel. Instead, we channel FPA energy into those existing courses, then layer our additional skills (like HAM radio use) on top. This taught us that **integration doesn’t mean assimilation** – FPA can train with CERT and still retain its unique structure and independence.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Reach out to local emergency management offices that run CERT in each region. Introduce FPA and propose mutual training nights or allowing FPA members to enroll in CERT classes.
    
- Encourage every FPA squad to have at least one member complete CERT basic training (the 20-hour course) and one CERT member attend an FPA meeting, fostering two-way exchange.
    
- Share resources: provide CERT programs with FPA’s Compass Guide or specialized materials (e.g., our HAM primer) and in return get access to CERT training manuals and exercises.
    
- Adapt the CERT materials into FPA’s context: e.g., develop a brief addendum for FPA squads on how to integrate CERT’s incident tactics into FPA squad action plans, ensuring common approach at disaster scenes.
    
- Invite CERT instructors to FPA regional gatherings to give talks or run drills. Likewise, offer FPA experts (like a HAM lead or wilderness medic) to present at CERT events, raising FPA’s profile.
    
- Document FPA member participation in CERT (maybe a checkbox in the squad registry for who’s CERT-certified) so we know our internal capability and can leverage those folks as instructors within FPA too.
    
- Use CERT’s existing evaluation drills as a low-cost way to gauge squad readiness – basically piggyback on their simulations rather than always staging our own, saving resources.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If local CERT programs show resistance or bureaucracy slows cooperation, pursue alternate routes like partnering with Red Cross community classes or state guard volunteer programs for similar training. Also, cultivate our own “FPA-CERT” liaisons – members who are dual FPA and CERT volunteers – to be bridges even if official channels stall. In areas without a strong CERT presence (rural regions), adapt CERT curriculum to run FPA-led basic training workshops (essentially FPA becomes the CERT equivalent there). Should any CERT guidelines conflict with FPA’s ethos (e.g., CERT says wait for officials, while FPA leans toward immediate action), clarify that FPA members in CERT exercises follow those rules for that context, but in real events will act under the Trust Doctrine and then integrate when officials arrive. Maintaining respect and clear communication will prevent turf wars and ensure FPA can still function independently if needed while having the benefit of CERT’s knowledge base.
    

### Phase 3.12: Formalize Partnership with FEMA and State Agencies

**Description:** Establish formal recognition and liaison channels between FPA and government emergency management (FEMA at the federal level and state emergency agencies). This may include signing Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) outlining how FPA squads will cooperate in disasters, having FPA representatives liaise at Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), and ensuring FPA is integrated into the “whole community” response framework. The partnership remains equal – FPA offers manpower and local intel, while FEMA/State offer coordination and resources – without compromising FPA’s independence.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2026, FPA signed a national MOU with FEMA similar to Team Rubicon’s arrangement​[fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230907/fema-team-rubicon-sign-agreement-about-preparedness-response-and-recovery#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20,and%20other%20emergency%20management%20operations). When a tropical storm hit North Carolina, an FPA liaison was present at the state EOC. As flooding reports came in, she relayed information from FPA squads on the ground directly to FEMA officials, providing real-time neighborhood-level updates. In turn, FEMA shared broader situational awareness and official relief plans with FPA (via our liaison and Outernet feeds), so our squads knew where not to send volunteers and where help was truly lacking​[fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230907/fema-team-rubicon-sign-agreement-about-preparedness-response-and-recovery#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20increased%20partnership%20and%20collaboration,%E2%80%9D).  
**Lessons Learned:** Initially, approaching a huge agency like FEMA was intimidating. We learned to start at the state level: after Texas included FPA in a few drills, it paved the way for federal recognition. Another lesson was to articulate clearly that FPA does **not** seek to replace or bypass official response, but rather to fill gaps (an important trust point). By framing FPA as a force multiplier and quoting the FEMA ethos of “whole community response,” we eased political concerns. We also learned the value of paperwork: an MOU doesn’t guarantee smooth sailing, but it gave locals the confidence to call on us without legal fears. Our trustworthiness, once demonstrated, led to things like an FPA seat at FEMA’s National Response Coordination Center during big incidents, which massively improved information flow both ways​[fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230907/fema-team-rubicon-sign-agreement-about-preparedness-response-and-recovery#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20increased%20partnership%20and%20collaboration,%E2%80%9D).  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Draft an FPA-FEMA partnership proposal. Include FPA’s mission, structures, capabilities, and how we align with FEMA’s goals (e.g., emphasizing community resilience, plugging into CERT and VOAD as references). Keep tone cooperative, not renegade.
    
- Identify sympathetic officials or emergency managers (some may have seen FPA in action locally). Use those champions to get introductions at higher levels. If possible, secure a meeting between FPA national leaders and FEMA’s volunteer liaison or even Administrator to discuss collaboration.
    
- Work state by state as needed: have regional FPA leads approach their state emergency management offices to be included in state disaster plans. Show up at state-run drills or planning meetings to make FPA known.
    
- Once interest is established, formalize it: sign MOUs or letters of agreement with clear language that FPA remains an independent volunteer entity but will coordinate through established structures (like reporting to the local Incident Command Post when responding, etc.). Also clarify liability and safety expectations so everyone is comfortable.
    
- Place liaisons: designate experienced FPA members who can represent us in emergency operations centers. Train them in ICS (Incident Command System) jargon so they can interface professionally. Get them badged if required for EOC access ahead of time.
    
- Integrate communication: ensure FPA’s radio frequencies or contacts are known to FEMA’s communication unit leaders, and vice versa. Possibly tie into FEMA’s radio plans (like RACES frequencies) during big events so information can be shared.
    
- Keep relationships warm: attend FEMA workshops, invite officials to observe FPA drills, and maintain a quarterly check-in so the partnership isn’t just on paper.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If federal bureaucracy stalls (it can), focus on building success at local and state levels – FEMA will eventually take note of a proven track record. Should any government official attempt to direct or control FPA beyond the MOU’s scope (e.g., telling squads they can’t self-deploy when lives are at stake), FPA leadership must diplomatically push back, invoking the independence clause. In scenarios where politics make open partnership risky (perhaps some regimes might distrust citizen groups), FPA can adopt a more informal support role – we’ll still operate, just without public fanfare, coordinating through back-channels if needed. If MOUs are questioned legally, lean on the fact that volunteer efforts are protected under Good Samaritan laws and that FPA is simply an organized extension of neighborly aid. And if all else fails with formal recognition, remember FPA can still do its work without permission – but having even a loose handshake with authorities greatly reduces friction when on the ground.
    

### Phase 3.13: Partner with NGOs (Red Cross, Team Rubicon, etc.)

**Description:** Build collaborative relationships with major disaster relief NGOs like the **American Red Cross**, **Team Rubicon**, **Salvation Army**, and others in the humanitarian space. This involves information-sharing agreements, mutual support understandings, and possibly joint deployments where FPA squads operate alongside or in support of these organizations. By partnering, FPA avoids duplicating services (e.g., we won’t run a shelter next door to a Red Cross shelter, we’ll help fill its gaps) and taps into a larger network of resources while still focusing on our agile, grassroots strengths.  
**Real-World Example:** During a 2026 wildfire in Colorado, FPA volunteers linked up with Team Rubicon’s Greyshirts at a fire camp. The Red Cross managed evacuation shelters, Team Rubicon handled chainsaw crews and debris removal, and FPA squads filled odd jobs like pet rescue and delivering local knowledge (one squad mapped functional wells for water when hydrants failed). Thanks to pre-season meetings, everyone knew their role. A Red Cross shelter manager even used the FPA radio net to request extra cots from a neighboring town’s FPA cache, speeding up the supply chain beyond what her HQ could do.  
**Lessons Learned:** We learned humility and focus: established NGOs have decades of experience in certain areas (Red Cross in sheltering/mass care, Team Rubicon in heavy labor and veteran volunteer management). FPA’s role shines when we complement, not compete. Early on, one FPA group considered setting up a parallel aid station, which caused confusion – the lesson was coordinate beforehand to slot into existing efforts. We also learned that NGOs appreciate local intel and flexibility FPA brings: for example, our squads often arrive before big NGOs fully mobilize, so bridging that time gap is critical. Trust was built by small steps: an offer to help unload trucks here, a joint training weekend there. Over time, FPA became seen not as outsiders, but as reliable community-level partners.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Make contact with regional offices of key NGOs. For the Red Cross, find the local chapter disaster lead; for Team Rubicon, the state coordinator. Introduce FPA and suggest a meeting to explore cooperation.
    
- Participate in joint training: e.g., send FPA medics to Red Cross first aid classes (and vice versa, invite Red Cross folks to FPA’s HAM radio demos); have FPA squads volunteer in a Team Rubicon-led service project (like sandbagging a flood zone) to build rapport.
    
- Outline who does what in a disaster scenario: e.g., Red Cross runs shelters, FPA squads can help by distributing relief supplies or doing wellness checks in areas they can’t get to quickly. Document these complementary roles in a simple reference guide (possibly added to the Trust Doctrine appendix for external partners).
    
- Establish liaison positions similar to FEMA’s: assign FPA points-of-contact to interface with each major NGO during incidents. For example, have a Red Cross liaison in each region’s FPA relay squad who exchanges information with the Red Cross EOC rep.
    
- Integrate communications: if NGOs use radio (Red Cross has some radio networks, TR uses cell apps), see if we can share a channel or at least monitor each other. Or simply swap important phone numbers and include them in the registry under contacts.
    
- Offer resources smartly: if FPA has supply caches (coming in later milestones), inform NGOs that these exist and can be tapped in an emergency to support their operations. Conversely, if an NGO has excess donations of something, they might route to FPA for harder-to-reach families.
    
- Join coordination groups (which leads to the next milestone, VOAD) – many NGOs coordinate through those, and having FPA present as a member solidifies these partnerships.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If any NGO is hesitant or territorial, focus on informal cooperation. We don’t need a signed pact to help Red Cross at a shelter; squads can just show up and volunteer under their direction if that’s what it takes (with proper identification as FPA, to build our brand quietly). Should a partner NGO pull out of an area or be overwhelmed, FPA can step up to fill the void temporarily (with caution not to promise services we can’t sustain long-term). If misunderstandings arise (e.g., someone in an NGO thinks FPA overstepped), arrange a debrief to clear the air and adjust. We will maintain our principle of acting in the survivors’ best interest – not ego – so we’ll yield command when needed and lead when no one else shows up. If an NGO partner is not present in a disaster, that’s a sign for FPA to possibly carry that torch locally until they arrive (for example, if no Red Cross yet and people need shelter, an FPA squad might run a pop-up shelter but then happily hand it off once Red Cross comes, keeping relations positive). In essence, flexibility and courtesy will guide partnerships even if formal MOUs aren’t in place everywhere.
    

### Phase 3.14: Join National VOAD and Conduct Joint Exercises

**Description:** Become a member of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (**VOAD**) network and actively engage in multi-organization planning and exercises. National VOAD is an umbrella that brings together dozens of nonprofits and faith-based groups in disasters. FPA’s involvement will formalize our place among recognized responders and open doors for coordination and resource sharing. This milestone also includes running joint drills with a mix of agencies and NGOs, to practice unified response scenarios (FPA squads working alongside Red Cross, state officials, etc.).  
**Real-World Example:** FPA’s application to National VOAD was approved in 2025, making us one of the newer members alongside groups like United Way and Habitat for Humanity. Shortly after, FPA participated in a large-scale hurricane response exercise in Florida involving VOAD partners: our role was to simulate community-led search and communications while other NGOs ran shelters and food distribution. The exercise revealed friction points (like radio frequency conflicts and overlap in outreach efforts) which were then resolved in a post-drill meeting. By the next real hurricane, those issues were ironed out, and FPA was included in the state’s coordination calls as an equal player.  
**Lessons Learned:** Joining VOAD taught us the value of visibility and standards. We had to clearly explain our mission and abide by certain guidelines (like not self-deploying into disaster zones without checking in, to avoid duplicating efforts) – a reasonable trade-off to be at the table. We learned that through VOAD, we could influence broader strategy: for instance, FPA lobbied successfully within VOAD for better use of HAM radio when phone networks collapse, something that wasn’t on their radar before. Another lesson from joint exercises was that FPA needed to practice the Incident Command System (ICS) structure to slot into multi-agency operations smoothly. Some squads initially chafed at “command and control” style, but drills underscored that we can follow an incident commander in the moment and still stay true to our independence outside those operations.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Complete the application for National VOAD membership (or relevant regional VOAD chapters where applicable). Highlight FPA’s unique contributions: community reach, communications, flexibility. Provide references from any friendly agencies or NGOs to bolster the application.
    
- Once a member, assign a representative to attend VOAD meetings regularly (national conference calls, regional coordination meetings, etc.). They will report back to FPA leadership so we stay aligned with larger efforts.
    
- Volunteer FPA for roles within VOAD working groups – for example, communications task forces or community preparedness committees. This builds our influence and integrates our ideas (like Outernet usage or grassroots intel sharing) into mainstream plans.
    
- Organize at least one major joint exercise per year in each region, involving FPA squads and at least one external partner (be it a state agency drill or a Red Cross simulation). Treat it as a no-fault learning event – the point is to identify friction when multiple groups operate together.
    
- During joint drills, have FPA members practice using ICS roles (someone may act as Liaison Officer, another as Operations Section Chief for volunteer teams, etc.) to gain comfort with that system in a low-stakes environment.
    
- Incorporate feedback from partners after drills: if, say, an official found it hard to track our squad activities in a simulation, we might create a simple reporting form or delegate one of our folks to be “reporter” at the command post next time.
    
- Publicize our VOAD involvement within FPA: it’s a morale boost for volunteers to know their work is recognized alongside big names. Also, it educates them on the broader disaster response ecosystem, so they understand why certain protocols exist.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If our membership is delayed or if VOAD isn’t active in a particular crisis, we still coordinate ad hoc as we did before – VOAD just makes it easier. FPA squads should never wait on bureaucracy to act in life-saving situations, but VOAD guidance will help us plug into official relief when it arrives. Should a joint exercise reveal major issues (like an agency not wanting to work with “unofficial” volunteers), we address it through relationship-building or adjust our approach (maybe we operate just outside the hot zone and feed information in, instead of direct integration, until trust is earned). If political shifts ever threaten VOAD itself (funding cuts or leadership changes), FPA will maintain those peer relationships directly – essentially VOAD formalizes connections that we can sustain informally if needed. In short, formal networks are great, but FPA’s true resilience is that even if they vanish, we still know how to reach our partners and get the job done.
    

### Phase 3.15: Define FPA Rank Structure and Governance Roles

**Description:** Clearly establish and document the expanded FPA rank and governance structure to support the now-national organization. This includes defining responsibilities from **O1** through **O10** officer ranks (e.g., squad leaders, regional coordinators, national council members) and introducing a custom **E-10** rank to honor top-tier field experts who aren’t in formal leadership. By having a transparent rank system, FPA can maintain order and clarity as it grows, ensuring everyone knows who’s coordinating what without creating a rigid hierarchy. This milestone translates the informal leadership that emerged in Phase 2 into a codified system for Phase 3.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2026, the FPA National Council ratified a Rank Charter. For instance, they defined **O-3** as a Squad Leader, **O-5** as a Regional Coordinator, **O-8** as a National Council officer, and **O-10** as the nominal head of FPA (though as a council chair, not a dictator). Meanwhile, veteran volunteers who wanted to remain “in the field” could be recognized as **E-10 Master Responders**, signaling decades of experience. This structure was put to the test during a multi-state wildfire: Region 9’s Coordinator (an O-5) coordinated efforts across squads, while an O-8 National Operations officer facilitated resources between regions. Everyone from new recruits to outside agencies could see the chain of coordination, yet decisions still flowed from the ground up per the Trust Doctrine.  
**Lessons Learned:** We realized that some military-like ranks help quickly convey roles, especially when interfacing with officials (who understand what a “Captain” or regional lead implies). But we had to customize it to our volunteer spirit: no saluting or rigid command-and-control. A lesson was to avoid rank inflation – initially we had too many levels for the size, causing confusion. We trimmed it to what made sense (few if any O-7 to O-10 at the start, those ranks mostly empty or honorary until growth warrants). The creation of an **E-10** rank for seasoned field leaders was born from feedback: not everyone wants to sit on a council, some want to keep doing rescues at 60 years old but deserve recognition and a voice. We also learned to tie rank with accountability, not privilege: a higher rank means more duties to the network, and our culture needed to reflect that (avoiding ego trips). Clear documentation in the FPA Dictionary and Compass Guide addendum helped members grasp the new system quickly.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Draft a rank structure proposal with input from Phase 2 squad leaders. For example: Enlisted E-1 through E-9 corresponding to regular members and local specialists; E-10 reserved for those with exceptional service record (a bit like a lifetime achievement that still keeps them operational). Officer O-1 through O-3 for local squad leadership positions, O-4 through O-6 for regional leadership, O-7 through O-9 for national directors or council roles, and O-10 as a ceremonial top rank (e.g., National Chairperson of FPA Council).
    
- Define each rank’s general role and responsibilities in a simple guideline document (e.g., “O-3 (Squad Leader): leads a local squad, coordinates local training and missions, liaises with O-5 regional lead” etc.). Keep it straightforward to avoid corporate-style bloating.
    
- Create insignia or titles that are easy to use. We might not use military titles directly (to avoid confusion with actual military); perhaps we use terms like “Squad Leader,” “Regional Officer,” “National Councilor,” but map them to O-ranks for internal reference. The E-10 might be dubbed “Master Responder” or similar, as an honorary title.
    
- Update the FPA Dictionary and Compass Guide with these definitions so every member can refer to them. Also, publish a one-pager cheat sheet that can be distributed at meetings or via Outernet for those offline.
    
- Implement the structure in the squad registry: add rank fields for key contacts. For instance, list John Doe as O-3 Squad Leader for X Squad, Jane Smith as O-5 Regional Coordinator for Midwest, etc. This immediately shows the network who their go-to leaders are.
    
- Explain and socialize the changes: hold a national radio call or Outernet announcement explaining that this isn’t a power grab but an organizing tool. Emphasize that trust and competence are how leaders are chosen; rank just clarifies roles.
    
- Provide a pathway for advancement that’s merit-based: set criteria (like experience, training, peer endorsement) for someone to move from O-3 to O-4, etc., or to be awarded E-10. Possibly incorporate this into the FPA Trust Doctrine – leadership arises from service and peer trust, not self-appointment.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If there’s pushback internally (some members may bristle at any semblance of hierarchy), reinforce that this structure is about coordination, not control. We can make it flexible – e.g., allow squads to elect their leaders who then get an O-ranking, rather than having them “appointed” from above. If the structure proves too granular, we can compress it (we might not need all 10 officer ranks immediately – that’s fine, we can leave some unused without issue). Conversely, if key leadership roles are vacant (no volunteer for a certain region lead), the rank exists but is simply unfilled until someone steps up – another region’s officer can cover interim with dual-hatting. The E-10 concept should be handled carefully: it’s meant to honor and include expert volunteers, but if it causes confusion or elitism, we’d scrap it or rename it. We’ll monitor feedback closely; the rank system is a tool we control, not something that controls us. If it doesn’t serve the mission, we adjust or dismantle it – the ultimate authority is the Trust Doctrine and the needs of the alliance, not stripes on a sleeve.
    

### Phase 3.16: Form National Leadership Council

**Description:** Establish a representative National Council for FPA, composed of regional representatives and key officers, to provide coordination and governance at the national level. The council’s role is to set broad strategy, uphold the Trust Doctrine, mediate inter-region issues, and manage initiatives that span beyond any one squad or region (like Phase 3 itself). Importantly, this council operates on democratic and transparent principles, not as a top-down authority. It’s more of a board of trusted coordinators ensuring the alliance moves in one direction when needed without infringing on local autonomy.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2025, after several months of ad-hoc national planning calls, FPA convened its first National Leadership Council meeting (virtually, across multiple radio and internet links). Each of the 10 regions had elected or agreed on one representative (O-5 rank) to send, and a few specialized leads (like the head of the Outernet Content Team and an advisor for training) joined as well. In that meeting, they tackled issues like standardizing certain protocols and planned Phase 3 rollout details. The council elected a chairperson (the acting O-10, purely as a facilitator) and set a schedule for regular meetings. When Hurricane Omega struck in 2026, this council quickly assembled to coordinate multi-region support, proving its worth by avoiding duplication of effort and sharing resources intelligently across state lines.  
**Lessons Learned:** One lesson was to keep the council size manageable but representative – we started with about 15 members (which worked). Too few would ignore voices, too many would be unwieldy. We learned to rotate agenda and leadership to avoid any one faction dominating: e.g., different regions take turns chairing monthly calls. Initially, some local squads feared this was a drift to centralization, but by publishing council meeting notes and inviting feedback on decisions, trust was maintained. Another lesson: we needed a mechanism to resolve ties or disagreements – we adopted a simple voting system (one region, one vote on major issues) and a commitment to consensus where possible, which has held so far. The council also learned its limits – it doesn’t micromanage local squads; if it tried, people would ignore it. Instead, it focuses on big picture and leaves execution to those on the ground.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Determine the composition of the National Council: likely one representative from each region (10), plus a few at-large positions for key domains (communications, training, logistics, etc.) for expertise. Ensure every member is an active FPA volunteer with trust of their peers.
    
- Set selection method: allow regions to choose their rep by vote or consensus among squad leaders. For at-large seats, perhaps the existing interim leaders (from Phase 2’s core team) fill them initially, with plan for formal selection later.
    
- Define the council’s scope in writing (a simple charter): e.g., “Council coordinates national initiatives and upholds alliance principles; it does not interfere in operational decisions of squads unless coordination is required across regions.” Make this transparent to all members to alleviate concerns.
    
- Establish meeting routines: monthly strategic calls, and emergency sessions whenever a multi-region disaster occurs. Use multi-platform approach – internet conferencing when available, HF radio net as backup, plus ensure minutes are recorded (and later distributed via email or Outernet for transparency).
    
- Give the council some teeth in governance but also checks: for example, the council can propose amendments to FPA guidelines, but these might require ratification by a wider vote of squads (to avoid disconnect). Outline such processes so everyone knows the rules of the game.
    
- Create working groups under the council for specific tasks (mirroring some Phase 3 topics): e.g., an Outernet working group, a Training standardization group, etc., headed by council members but involving other volunteers. This spreads the work and keeps non-council members engaged in decision-making.
    
- Embrace technology for efficiency: set up a secure online forum or email list for council discussions (with an offline equivalent via radio nets weekly for those who can’t do internet), so coordination is continuous, not just at meetings. Use AI tools (if available) to compile reports or track action items, easing the admin burden.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If any region refuses to participate initially (maybe they’re skeptical), leave the door open – show results and they’ll likely join when they see it’s helpful. If a council member isn’t performing (missing meetings or not communicating back to their region), regions should have a way to replace them – built into the charter (accountability and recall). In the event the council makes an unpopular decision, we’ve instated a check: a petition of a certain number of squads can force a reconsideration or wider vote. This prevents a disconnect between council and ground truth. Should communications fail during a crisis (no meetings possible), we revert to a pre-agreed protocol: e.g., each region acts autonomously, guided by Trust Doctrine, until comms resume – basically fail-safe to Phase 2 mode if needed. The council exists to help, not to hinder; if it ever became a hindrance or bureaucratic quagmire, FPA members would and should bypass it and just coordinate informally until a better structure is in place. Our contingency is always to trust the people on the ground and re-center authority to them if the fancy structures falter.
    

### Phase 3.17: Establish National Voting and Feedback Mechanisms

**Description:** Implement systems for alliance-wide decision-making and feedback, ensuring that the broader FPA membership has a voice in major decisions. This includes setting up a secure voting process for things like electing national leaders or approving changes to the Trust Doctrine, as well as continuous feedback channels (surveys, after-action reviews) that feed into council decisions. The goal is to maintain grassroots control and buy-in even as we organize nationally: FPA remains by the members, for the members.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2027, the National Council proposed a significant update to the Trust Doctrine to incorporate Phase 3 lessons on AI use and partnerships. Rather than just declare it, they put it up for a vote among all squads. Using a combination of an online portal and radio call-in verification for offline squads, votes were tallied over a two-week period. Over 85% of squads participated, and the doctrine update passed with 92% approval – providing a strong mandate and sense of unity. Additionally, an anonymous post-disaster feedback survey was introduced via Outernet broadcasts; for example, after a large deployment, any member could send in critiques or praises which the council compiled to learn from. These mechanisms proved that even at scale, FPA could stay responsive to its base, avoiding the pitfall of many organizations that lose touch as they grow.  
**Lessons Learned:** Setting up a voting system in a decentralized network was tricky. We learned to verify squads via unique codes (distributed in Phase 2) to prevent any impersonation in voting. Also, simplicity is key – we vote sparingly, only on big issues, to avoid voter fatigue. We found that when members had a direct say, they were more committed to outcomes (even if they initially disagreed, the fact that it was a fair vote helped acceptance). The feedback loops taught us unexpected things – e.g., a small squad pointed out that our Outernet content was too techy; that feedback, collected through the new system, led to more plain-language bulletins. We also learned transparency in results is important: publishing how decisions were made and what the vote counts were (without PII) further increased trust in the system.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Develop a reliable database of “voting units.” Likely each squad gets one collective vote on major matters (to keep things manageable and encourage internal discussion), or alternatively each registered member gets a vote – but that could be thousands, which is harder to manage offline. Decide this via the council and by polling membership on preference.
    
- Choose a voting method that accommodates offline members: e.g., an online voting platform for those with internet, and a parallel radio/phone voting system. For radio, we can assign code words or numbers to squads: they transmit their vote to a regional relay, which passes to national tally. Use verification (like pre-shared authentication codes per squad to avoid spoofing).
    
- Test the voting process on a non-critical issue (say, choose a new logo or motto) to iron out technical kinks and ensure everyone understands how to participate.
    
- Create a small election committee from the council or volunteers to oversee vote collection and counting, with observers from different regions (ensuring no bias). If feasible, involve an AI system to tally results quickly and flag any anomalies (like duplicate entries) for human review.
    
- Establish regular feedback channels: a digital form and a radio call-in schedule where any member can voice concerns or ideas. Summarize these inputs monthly and share with the council and membership (“You said, we did” reports to show responsiveness).
    
- Schedule periodic elections if applicable (for council seats or certain officer roles, maybe every 2 years) and a periodic referendum on any major policy changes (like any amendment to the Trust Doctrine must go to vote).
    
- Ensure the **Trust Doctrine** explicitly protects member voice: codify that major changes require consultation or vote, locking in this democratic approach for future leaders who might be tempted to bypass it.  
    **Contingency Plan:** For low participation issues (apathy), the council should do more listening tours and communication to make the stakes clear; perhaps require a quorum (minimum % of squads) for a vote to be valid. If we ever have a contested result (say a near 50/50 split on an issue), the council could hold off implementation and facilitate further discussion, maybe a compromise, before re-voting, to keep the alliance from fracturing. Should the voting system be compromised (e.g., an external actor tries to spam or jam our radio votes), we have backup verification—like requiring confirmation from regional leads for each tally they submitted, and the ability to re-run the vote via different channels if needed. If tech fails entirely, we revert to old-school methods: literal mail-in ballots or in-person votes at regional meetups (slower, but we’ll do it rather than let the process collapse). In essence, the contingency is always to find a way for members’ voices to be heard, even if it means extra steps or delays – better a slow consensus than a fast decree that people resent.
    

### Phase 3.18: Implement Squad Merger and Growth Protocols

**Description:** Develop guidelines for adjusting squad structures as membership fluctuates – including merging small squads, spinning off new squads from an overgrown one, or redistributing members if some areas thin out. This ensures the FPA network remains optimally organized for local effectiveness and that no squad becomes too weak or too unwieldy. The protocols will provide a fair, transparent process for such changes, driven by local members’ input, to maintain both efficiency and harmony.  
**Real-World Example:** By 2026, in some big cities the initial squads had grown to 50+ members – too large to be nimble. In one case, the Phoenix squad followed the new protocol to split into three neighborhood-based squads, each with its own leader, while forming a city council to stay coordinated. Conversely, in a rural part of Kansas, two tiny squads of 5 each decided to merge into one, after realizing they were duplicating efforts and both below critical mass. These changes, done under FPA’s merger guidelines, preserved morale (no one felt a takeover) and improved overall readiness – the Phoenix break-out squads could train more frequently in smaller groups, and the merged Kansas squad could field a full team where two half-teams struggled before.  
**Lessons Learned:** We discovered that letting squads figure it out organically worked to a point, but official guidance helped avoid turf battles or hurt feelings. One lesson was to involve all members in the discussion – when a merger was first floated in one area, leaders talked only among themselves and some members felt blindsided; we corrected that by requiring an all-hands meeting and vote for such changes. Another lesson: we set benchmarks to prompt consideration – e.g., if a squad exceeds 30 regularly active members, time to consider splitting for manageability; if it falls below 6, consider merging or recruiting. But we also learned not to force it – local context matters (maybe 40 well-organized folks can still function as one squad if they break into teams internally). Flexibility within a framework turned out to be key.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Define criteria for potential squad reorganization: membership count thresholds (upper and lower), geographic considerations (like squads overlapping or being very distant), and activity level (e.g., an inactive squad might merge into a neighboring one to revitalize).
    
- Draft a protocol document: how a proposal for merge/split is initiated (usually by the squads themselves or suggestion from a regional lead), how it’s discussed (joint meetings, mediated by a neutral if needed), and how it’s ratified (ideally by consensus or a vote of the members involved). Emphasize that no one is being “fired” – it’s about efficiency and better coverage.
    
- Assign regional coordinators to monitor squad health indicators via the registry and personal check-ins. If they notice persistent low numbers or overlarge squads, they can gently prompt those squads to consider the protocol, offering facilitation.
    
- Provide mediation support: perhaps an experienced squad leader from another area (or council member) can sit in on merger discussions to help align things, ensuring smaller personalities aren’t drowned out by bigger ones.
    
- Logistics of merging: decide how to consolidate resources (radios, caches, any funds) fairly. Likewise, splitting: determine a fair division of gear and assign new call signs or IDs for the new squads. Write these into the guidelines so it’s not ad hoc each time.
    
- Update the squad registry promptly when a change happens and broadcast the update to the network (so everyone knows “East Phoenix Squad” is now three separate squads with new names, etc., to avoid confusion in a crisis).
    
- Celebrate the change: if two squads merge, maybe hold a little joint exercise or social event to bond the new team. If splitting, ensure both new squads feel equally recognized as full entities (not “original vs breakaway” – perhaps even let them choose fresh names to avoid hierarchy).  
    **Contingency Plan:** If a squad resists a needed merge or split despite issues (maybe pride or fears involved), regional leadership can organize more support (like help with recruitment if they fear losing identity, or reassurance that splitting won’t isolate them). No forced reorg will occur – we lean on persuasion and obvious benefits. In case a merger goes through but internal conflicts linger (perhaps two former leaders now jostling for one spot), we’ll keep a close eye and offer leadership coaching or an agreeable role for each (one could be deputy, or one leads and the other focuses on training, etc.). If a split results in one faction struggling, we ensure the regional network gives that new squad extra help so they don’t flounder. Ultimately, if a particular area keeps oscillating (merge then split then merge), it might indicate personal issues or mis-drawn boundaries; the council can step in to reevaluate the situation holistically and adjust as needed. The protocols are a guide, not a hard law – human factors are always considered, and if the standard approach fails, we handle it case-by-case via the council or conflict resolution team.
    

### Phase 3.19: Integrate AI for Resource Planning and Oversight

**Description:** Deploy artificial intelligence tools to assist with resource planning, information management, and oversight, while keeping human judgment in charge. This includes using AI to analyze requests and offers across the network to suggest optimal allocation of resources (like matching a surplus of donated food in one region to a shortage in another), moderating internal communications for spam or misinformation, and reviewing proposals/policies for consistency with the Trust Doctrine. The AI acts as an advisor and efficiency booster – an “AI quartermaster and inspector” – but final decisions always rest with human FPA leadership.  
**Real-World Example:** By 2027, FPA introduced an AI-driven dashboard accessible to regional coordinators. When multiple squads submitted supply needs during a multi-state flood, the AI sorted through the data to highlight patterns (e.g., many requests for water filters) and identified where those were stored or could be procured, even suggesting the closest squad with extras. It flagged that Region 2 had 100 spare filters and Region 4 needed 80, prompting a transfer that might have been missed​[fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230907/fema-team-rubicon-sign-agreement-about-preparedness-response-and-recovery#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20increased%20partnership%20and%20collaboration,%E2%80%9D). In terms of oversight, the AI also scanned new FPA policy drafts for jargon or contradictions with our Trust Doctrine, helping polish proposals before humans debated them. It wasn’t perfect, but it saved time and caught details, like pointing out that a planned radio frequency rule conflicted with FCC regulations – something we corrected prior to implementation.  
**Lessons Learned:** We learned to view AI as a tool, not a leader. Early on, some members were wary, thinking “AI deployment” meant a robo-commander – we clarified it’s more like having a super-smart secretary/analyst. Transparency was key: we open-sourced our AI’s suggestion algorithms where possible, so members knew it wasn’t manipulating behind the scenes. One lesson was to fine-tune the AI with real FPA data; off-the-shelf, it gave some weird suggestions (like dispatching teams long-distance when locals were available). By training it on actual scenarios and feedback (“no, don’t send heavy generators by bicycle just because nearest road is closed”), it got more context-aware. We also set boundaries: e.g., AI could flag communications that seem toxic or spammy on our forums, but it cannot ban anyone – that triggers a human moderator to review, keeping final authority with people. The oversight AI pointing out Trust Doctrine issues proved helpful – though occasionally too pedantic, it forced us to articulate and sometimes improve our principles to satisfy both human and machine logic.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Identify key areas where AI can help: likely inventory/resource management, scheduling, information triage, and document analysis. Avoid areas that require empathy or complex judgment (those remain human-led).
    
- Partner with a tech volunteer group or university to develop or adapt AI software for FPA needs. Perhaps adapt existing disaster management tools. Ensure data inputs (like squad inventories, requests, etc.) are fed in from our registry and comm logs.
    
- Pilot the AI on historical data: run it against past situations (e.g., last year’s hurricane response logs) to see what it would have suggested and tune its parameters based on whether those ideas are actually sensible or not.
    
- Set up an **AI Oversight Board** (maybe the one mentioned in governance planning) – a few FPA members with tech savvy and ethics insight – to monitor the AI’s recommendations and effects. They will ensure it’s not drifting into bias or misinterpreting our values (for instance, if the AI starts favoring efficiency over equitable help, that’s a red flag to correct).
    
- Incorporate AI outputs into decision-making routines: for example, before a council meeting, review the AI’s resource distribution suggestions as one input to plans; have moderators glance at AI-flagged posts in the forum each day as part of their workflow.
    
- Train members in how to work with the AI: e.g., regional leads learn to query the dashboard (“show me all unmet requests in my region”) or ask for possible solutions (“how can we get more medical kits?”). Provide cheat sheets or a help function (and yes, print a guide for those who might use it via text interface only).
    
- Continuously improve the AI with feedback: encourage users to mark AI suggestions as helpful or not, and feed that back into the system’s learning process. Keep the AI’s knowledge of FPA values up-to-date by inputting our Trust Doctrine and any new policies so it can check alignment.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If the AI system fails or gives bad info (say it’s down during a disaster or makes a flawed recommendation), revert to normal human-led processes – we must ensure no one has become solely reliant on it. Always have a human double-check critical suggestions (“AI says send all water to X – does that really make sense?”). If AI flags a human communication as suspect erroneously (false positive), moderators should quickly clear it and perhaps adjust the sensitivity to maintain trust in the process. In case of any suspicion that the AI has been compromised (cyberattack altering outputs), we’d disconnect it until verified, and possibly run a backup on a secure offline machine with known good data. We also commit that if AI ever conflicts with the Trust Doctrine or our human sense of compassion, we side with human judgment – that principle is clearly stated in our guidelines. As a final backup, all AI suggestions are just that – suggestions. If the power’s out or the data is lost, FPA operated just fine before without it and can do so again; Phase 3’s resilience doesn’t hinge on AI, it’s just augmented by it.
    

### Phase 3.20: Charter Update and Trust Doctrine Review Cycle

**Description:** Institutionalize a regular cycle for reviewing and updating FPA’s guiding documents – such as the FPA Constitution/Charter and the Trust Doctrine – to incorporate lessons learned and adapt to new challenges (like technologies or geopolitical changes) while maintaining core principles. This includes scheduling a “constitutional convention” at set intervals (e.g., every 2 years) where proposals are debated (aided by AI analysis for consistency), then put to a member vote. The aim is to keep the alliance’s foundation documents living and relevant, and to reaffirm our values in a changing world, preventing stagnation or drift from our original mission.  
**Real-World Example:** After Phase 3 initiatives had been in place for a while, the 2028 FPA Convention was convened. Representatives from every region (largely the National Council plus additional delegates) gathered both in-person and virtually. They reviewed a slate of amendments: one added an Outernet usage policy to the Trust Doctrine (ensuring open access to information), another refined the volunteer code of conduct based on incident reports, and another formalized the political neutrality clause given some new partisan pressures seen. An AI tool had pre-scanned the proposals, flagging one that inadvertently contradicted an earlier principle about local autonomy. Delegates debated and revised accordingly. The updated Charter and Doctrine were then ratified by an all-squad vote. This process, repeated biennially, became a cornerstone of FPA’s governance – demonstrating that unlike some institutions that calcify, FPA learns and self-corrects over time, guided by its members’ collective wisdom and a little AI assistance to keep things coherent.  
**Lessons Learned:** One lesson is that frequent minor tweaks are better than rare big overhauls. By reviewing every two years (or even annually informally), issues can be addressed before they fester. We learned to set high bars for altering core principles – not everything needs changing – but also not to treat the original word as sacred if reality proves otherwise. For instance, our Trust Doctrine initially assumed no formal partnerships, but Phase 3 taught us we could partner without losing independence, so we adjusted that language to reflect healthy collaboration. The AI proved helpful in tracking changes, ensuring we didn’t introduce loopholes or contradictions (like it caught that a new safety rule conflicted with our empowerment ethos until reworded). We also made sure to enshrine the member-vote requirement for these changes, so no future leadership could quietly rewrite the rules. Perhaps the biggest lesson is that this open revision process became an asset: new members, seeing that everything is up for honest review, felt more empowered to suggest improvements, knowing FPA isn’t stuck in the past.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Set a schedule for official reviews (e.g., every 2 years a convention, with emergency amendments possible in between if critically needed). Publish this schedule in the Compass Guide so everyone knows when big decisions are coming.
    
- Create a process for submitting amendments: any squad or member can propose a change, but perhaps funnel them through regional councils for refinement. Use the AI to gather related context (e.g., what happened that spurred this change, what other text would it affect) and include that in the briefing materials.
    
- Assemble a diverse committee to draft the initial slate of changes before the convention – include veteran members, newcomers, different regions, maybe even an external advisor (like a disaster ethics expert) for perspective. This committee works with AI to ensure clarity and alignment with core values.
    
- Host the convention in a hybrid format: encourage as many as feasible to meet physically (build camaraderie) with remote links for those who can’t. Ensure real-time translation or summaries if needed for any language barriers as we go global.
    
- Use the agreed voting mechanism (from Phase 3.17) to ratify changes. Ensure there’s ample time for squads to discuss draft changes locally before final votes – this might mean releasing draft proposals months in advance and letting feedback come in (aided by AI aggregating common concerns perhaps) to refine language.
    
- Codify the neutrality and independence clauses strongly now that Phase 3 is mature: e.g., an amendment that FPA shall remain non-partisan and not under government control, which can only be overturned by an overwhelming supermajority, if at all. Lock in those hard-won principles so they’re not easily eroded in the future.
    
- Archive old versions of our Charter/Doctrine publicly (within FPA) to maintain transparency about how our principles evolve. Perhaps even broadcast the highlights of changes via Outernet for all members to acknowledge and understand.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If a scheduled convention falls during a major crisis (disaster year), we can postpone rather than rush it – survival comes first. If internal disagreements on changes are sharp, and risk splitting the alliance, we might table the most divisive issues for further study instead of forcing them through – maintain unity as a priority. For global integration (Phase 4 perhaps), we may need to transition to an international constitutional process; our national cycle might become a subset of a larger global one. The contingency there is to ensure global additions don’t override national autonomy without careful consideration – basically apply the same philosophy upward. And if technology fails (e.g., the AI tool isn’t available or online voting is down), fall back to analog: mail out proposed changes via post or couriers to squads, gather their written votes. It’s slow, but in matters of core principles, thoroughness beats speed. Ultimately, the bedrock is the Trust Doctrine – even if we couldn’t formally meet, FPA would continue operating by those values as understood, until such time we can convene and adjust formally. No gap in our legalese will stop the mission, but keeping our doctrine up-to-date will only strengthen our resolve and clarity.
    

> _“I’ve been in disaster relief for 20 years, but I’ve never seen anything like this network. During the last hurricane, I used our FPA app to vote on where to send our extra generators – and the next day, I heard on the radio that exactly that plan was in motion. It feels like being part of a living organism that actually listens.”_ – FPA Regional Coordinator, Southeast US

### Phase 3.21: Implement Member Verification System

**Description:** Develop a secure member verification system (ID cards, call signs, and web-of-trust confirmations) to ensure that each FPA volunteer is authenticated. This reduces the risk of impersonators or bad actors and builds confidence when squads collaborate nationally.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2026, FPA issued wallet-sized ID cards with QR codes to all active members. When an out-of-state squad arrived to assist after a tornado, local teams scanned their cards to confirm identities and credentials on the spot, preventing confusion about who was truly FPA.  
**Lessons Learned:** Earlier responses saw instances of well-meaning unaffiliated volunteers claiming to be FPA, which created liability and trust issues. The verification rollout taught us to balance security with privacy – minimal personal data on IDs, but enough to validate membership quickly.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Assign each member a unique ID and callsign, recorded in the national registry.
    
- Issue physical ID badges and digital certificates (for those with internet) that squads can use to verify newcomers or outside helpers.
    
- Implement a simple verification protocol via radio (e.g., challenge-response codes) for when digital methods aren’t available.
    
- Train squads on politely verifying credentials during multi-squad operations, making it a standard practice.
    
- Periodically audit the member list for inactive or expired credentials and update the registry accordingly.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If an ID is lost or suspected misused, mark it as void in the registry and inform squads (via Outernet bulletin) to watch for that ID. In politically sensitive situations where carrying an FPA ID could endanger a member, establish a covert verification method (like code phrases) so members can still recognize each other safely.
    

### Phase 3.22: Prepare for Global Network Expansion

**Description:** Lay the groundwork for FPA to expand beyond national borders by identifying partner communities or diaspora groups in other countries interested in forming their own FPA squads. This preparation includes sharing our Phase 1-3 playbooks, adapting them to local contexts, and establishing communication links.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2027, FPA leaders held virtual meetings with volunteer groups in Canada and the UK who had followed our progress. We provided them with translated Compass Guides and Trust Doctrine documents. Soon, pilot squads in Toronto and London began using the FPA model, effectively becoming the first international chapters.  
**Lessons Learned:** We learned that our system isn’t one-size-fits-all globally – local laws and cultures required tweaks (for instance, radio licensing differs by country). Starting slow and respecting local autonomy was crucial. We also confirmed that our core values (trust, decentralization) resonated universally, which was encouraging.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Identify at least 3 countries with strong community preparedness movements and reach out via personal networks or social media.
    
- Share FPA’s Phase 1-3 guides, and offer mentorship to interested foreign leaders on how to bootstrap squads, emphasizing they can and should adapt to local needs.
    
- Set up an international liaison team within FPA to handle communications, time zone coordination, and cultural advice for global partners.
    
- Establish a simple onboarding process: e.g., new country squads operate under a provisional “FPA affiliate” status until they craft their own Trust Doctrine aligned with ours.
    
- Create an online forum (with offline digest via Outernet) where domestic and international FPA members can exchange tips and support, building a global community from day one.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If initial interest abroad is low, focus on quality of a few pilot international squads rather than quantity. Political barriers (like a country suspicious of foreign ties) can be mitigated by having that country’s FPA branch use a local name and simply share principles informally. Ensure that if global expansion slows, it doesn’t detract from national strength – the global team operates as a support unit and doesn’t drain resources from ongoing domestic efforts.
    

### Phase 3.23: Establish Global Communication Standards

**Description:** Create a framework for international communications among FPA chapters: common HAM radio HF frequencies for long-distance links, time-coordinated global radio check-ins, and shared Outernet content streams for worldwide alerts. This ensures that even across continents, FPA teams can reach each other and share critical information.  
**Real-World Example:** By 2028, FPA’s Global Net schedule was in place – every Sunday GMT, ham operators from different countries checked in on a designated 14.300 MHz frequency. During a Pacific earthquake, an FPA operator in Japan relayed damage reports over HF radio that were picked up in California and forwarded to other chapters, providing early situational awareness globally.  
**Lessons Learned:** We discovered propagation and language barriers needed addressing – some regions couldn’t reliably reach others via HF at certain hours, so we added alternate freqs and relays. Also, having basic English language protocols helped, but we learned to incorporate translation help (like bilingual operators or simple codes) so no group is left out due to language.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Assign specific HF frequencies (and backup frequencies) for FPA international use on popular ham bands (20m, 40m), and publish this in all chapters’ comm plans.
    
- Coordinate a global communications schedule (e.g., weekly nets) and practice cross-border message relays during these nets to build familiarity.
    
- Extend Outernet content to include international updates – e.g., disaster alerts or requests from any FPA chapter worldwide, tagged by region for relevance.
    
- Develop simple translation protocols: perhaps agreed signal codes or having each chapter prepare messages in both their language and English for broader distribution.
    
- Create an international contact directory (callsigns and email) of key communications leads in each country, so operators know whom to reach out to when needing a link.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If propagation fails (like a solar storm disrupting HF), lean on internet (if available) or satellite phones as backup links between continents. If language issues impede a message, have pre-designated multilingual volunteers in different chapters who can step in to interpret via radio or text. In politically tense times, keep international comms low-profile (amateur radio offers some deniability since it’s a common hobby) to avoid drawing undue attention. Plan that no single country’s net control is critical – if one chapter goes offline, others can still interconnect through alternate paths.
    

### Phase 3.24: Form International Alliance Council

**Description:** As multiple countries develop FPA chapters, establish an International Alliance Council with representatives from each national FPA. This council coordinates global strategy, facilitates resource sharing for transnational crises, and ensures the core Trust Doctrine principles remain consistent worldwide, while respecting each nation’s autonomy.  
**Real-World Example:** In 2029, FPA’s first International Council meeting included reps from 5 countries. When severe floods struck South Asia that year, the Council quickly organized: the Indian FPA chapter requested water purification units, the US and UK chapters arranged to ship surplus units through military flights, and the Council liaison smoothed customs paperwork. This collective action made a tangible impact, showing the value of a global forum.  
**Lessons Learned:** We found the council works best as a facilitator, not a global boss. Cultural differences required sensitivity – decision-making had to be consensus-driven and slow enough to include voices from various time zones. We also learned to formalize how new chapters join and how to mediate disputes (like if two chapters had overlapping regions in expat communities). The experience underscored that our Trust Doctrine needed a global addendum addressing international cooperation and neutrality explicitly.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Invite each country’s FPA leadership to nominate one representative for the International Council.
    
- Draft an International Charter that outlines the council’s purpose (coordination, not control) and key agreements (e.g., sharing info, mutual aid, preserving independence of national groups).
    
- Schedule regular council calls (maybe quarterly) and an annual in-person or virtual summit to build relationships and review global initiatives.
    
- Create subcommittees for specific global issues: training standards, Outernet content globalization, cross-border logistics, etc., each led by different chapter reps to distribute work.
    
- Ensure translation and accessibility: provide simultaneous interpretation for meetings as needed and circulate written proposals in multiple languages beforehand.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If some large chapters choose not to participate, keep the door open – demonstrate the council’s value through successful collaborations. Should international tensions arise (say governments frown on an ‘international alliance’), emphasize that each national FPA is independent and participation is about humanitarian aid, not politics. If travel or tech issues hinder meetings, use asynchronous methods (shared documents, radio relays of meeting minutes over Outernet). The council should never become a single point of failure – if it’s unable to convene, bilateral or small group collaborations can fill the gap until full meetings resume. Essentially, the alliance can function even if formal council processes temporarily pause.
    

### Phase 3.25: Host Global Preparedness Summit & Knowledge Exchange

**Description:** Organize a regular Global Preparedness Summit where FPA members from around the world (and other community responders) come together to share best practices, train collectively, and demonstrate the power of decentralized readiness. This summit solidifies international bonds and spurs innovation by learning what works in different contexts.  
**Real-World Example:** The 2030 FPA Summit was held in Houston with delegates from 12 countries. Workshops ranged from drone mapping of disaster areas (taught by the Japan FPA chapter) to community trauma counseling (led by FPA-France). Attendees also participated in a large-scale drill simulating an earthquake response, mixing teams from various nations. Everyone left with new techniques and a deeper sense of being part of a global family.  
**Lessons Learned:** Pulling off an international conference was challenging – visas, funding travel, language differences – but worth the effort. We learned to include virtual participation for those who couldn’t attend, which expanded reach. Also, exchanging ideas face-to-face built trust that later made remote coordination smoother. The summit highlighted that some low-tech solutions in one country could benefit high-tech ones elsewhere and vice versa, reaffirming that every region has something to teach.  
**Actionable Steps:**

- Plan summits biennially, rotating host countries if possible to spread the travel burden and showcase different disaster contexts.
    
- Secure funding via donations, partner NGOs, or modest attendee fees to cover venue and travel scholarships for volunteers from low-income regions.
    
- Create a summit agenda that balances hands-on training (multi-national drills, skill workshops) with strategic discussions (like refining global protocols).
    
- Encourage open sharing: publish all presentations and training materials online (and via Outernet) for the benefit of those not present, and archive them as part of FPA’s global knowledge base.
    
- Involve external experts (from academia, agencies) for fresh insights, but keep the tone practical and peer-to-peer – this isn’t a lecture circuit, it’s doers teaching doers.  
    **Contingency Plan:** If international travel is not feasible (due to pandemics, political climate, etc.), pivot to a fully virtual summit using video links and real-time translation – and complement with many regional meetups that connect digitally. In case a planned host country faces a disaster at the time (ironically possible), be ready to relocate or delay rather than cancel – or turn the summit into a relief effort if appropriate. Maintain flexibility: the summit’s value is content and connection, not a fixed format. If costs become too high, scale down frequency or form regional mini-summits that then share outcomes globally. The spirit is that learning and camaraderie must continue, whatever the format.
    

_(The roadmap continues through additional milestones focusing on global Outernet coverage, multilingual content, cross-border aid protocols, global resource pooling, political neutrality, public outreach, volunteer well-being, cutting-edge decentralized technologies, and ultimately achieving a fully self-sustaining international network. These steps ensure that by the end of Phase 3, the FPA is not only nationwide but worldwide, bonded by trust and capable of weathering any crisis.)_

### PATCH 2025-05-02 2a83de

> Aligned to Mk1Mod3 glossary. Added canonical context block.

#### Glossary-linked Terms:
- [[TERM:Trust Doctrine]]
- [[TERM:Offline-First Resilience System (OFRS)]]
- [[TERM:TMP]]

#### Canonical Context Insert:
This white paper is a manifesto-style explanation of the **Fair Preparation Alliance vision**, useful for partner outreach, public onboarding, or early-stage funding partners. While inspirational in tone, all referenced systems (FPAi, TMP, SOPs, readiness tiers) now exist in full Mk1Mod3 documentation. Treat this as a **framing doc**, not a source of ground-truth protocols.
