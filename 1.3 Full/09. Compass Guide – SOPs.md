## Compass Guide – SOPs

> Canonical terms: [[TERM:Compass]], [[TERM:TMP (Test My Plan)]]

This guide maps each SOP to its strategic alignment categories using the Compass framework. SOPs must reference their position within:

- **Direction:** Purpose, Threat Tier, Readiness Context
- **Route:** Inputs, Dependencies, Prep
- **Checkpoints:** Verification steps, Triggers, Pulse Checks, [[TERM:TMP (Test My Plan)]] simulations
- **Destination:** Output conditions, Success criteria

SOPs built using the Compass must embed canonical terms via `[[TERM:...]]` to ensure future-proof clarity.

...# Compass Guide

**Welcome to the FPA Compass Guide.** This handbook is your orientation to the Fair Preparation Alliance – explaining _why_ we do things the FPA way and _how_ we stay on course. It’s designed to motivate you with a clear-eyed, no-nonsense view of what it means to be part of the FPA. New members and veterans alike use the Compass Guide to align with our core principles and practices. _(For detailed definitions of terms, see the **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]**, and for action steps to complete, see your **[[Personal SOP Checklist]]**.)_

## Purpose of the Compass Guide

**Why the “Compass” Guide?** Just as a compass provides direction, this guide keeps every member oriented on our mission and values. In a field crowded with hype and fear-mongering, the FPA Compass Guide is blunt and realistic – it spells out _why_ we operate the way we do, without any sugarcoating. This isn’t a pep talk or a glossy brochure; it’s a grounding reference to ensure we all stay on the same page. You’ll find explanations of FPA’s philosophy, from big-picture ethics down to everyday protocols. Whenever you’re unsure _why_ the FPA chooses one approach over another, the answer should be in here.

**How to use it:** New recruits should read through this guide during their orientation. It will give you context behind the rules and checklists you’ll follow. Seasoned members refer back to it whenever we face tough decisions or need to recalibrate our approach. The Compass Guide works alongside the other FPA resources – the **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]** tells you _what_ something means, the **SHTF Bible** (our survival manual) tells you _how_ to do something, and the Compass Guide tells you _why_ it matters. Together, these ensure your mindset and actions stay true to FPA’s mission.

## FPA Mission and Ethos

**Who we are:** The Fair Preparation Alliance is a volunteer-driven network focused on ethical, community-oriented prepping. We believe preparedness shouldn’t be a luxury or fringe hobby; it should be a practical, cooperative effort that anyone can join. That means **sharing knowledge freely, helping our neighbors, and working as a team** so that when disaster strikes, _no one is left behind_ due to lack of information or support. We prepare for everything from everyday emergencies to worst-case scenarios, always grounded in real-world facts and skills (no fantasy zombie apocalypses here). The FPA is about **empowerment over fear** – turning ordinary people into capable responders through training, fairness, and ingenuity.

**Who we are _not_:** We are _not_ a militia, a cult, or a doomsday fan club. The FPA does **not** endorse vigilante behavior or any form of unlawful activity. We prepare to defend ourselves _only_ as a last resort and always within the law – our focus is on safety and survival, not seeking conflict. We’re apolitical and inclusive: people of all backgrounds are welcome as long as they uphold our values. You might hear skeptics label any organized prepper group as “extremist,” but we prove them wrong by our actions. FPA works _with_ local communities and authorities, not against them. In short, we’re citizens training to be an asset in disasters, not a threat. The Compass Guide makes it clear that **discipline, ethics, and respect** are just as important as stockpiling supplies.

## Guiding Principles of the FPA

At the heart of the FPA are six core values that every member strives to uphold. These guiding principles define “fair preparation” and shape every decision and policy in the alliance:

- **Fairness:** We ensure equitable treatment and sharing within the group. Preparedness resources and information are accessible to everyone, not hoarded by a few. _Fair preparation_ means balancing your own family’s needs with compassion for others when possible – you help your neighbors because someday you may need their help too.
    
- **Integrity:** We value honesty and trustworthiness, doing what’s right even under stress. In practice, this means keeping your promises to your squad, reporting truthfully on your readiness status, and adhering to laws and ethical codes. Trust is the currency of any survival group – without integrity, the whole alliance falls apart.
    
- **Realism:** Our plans are grounded in facts and likely scenarios, not wild speculation. We don’t indulge in conspiracy theories or fantasy; we focus on practical threats (storms, outages, civil unrest, etc.) and use evidence-based strategies. Realism also means acknowledging our limits and the harsh truths of disaster – no hype, no wishful thinking. If an idea doesn’t work in real life, we discard it.
    
- **Self-Reliance:** Every member works to be as capable as possible. This means taking personal responsibility for your training and gear. You don’t wait for someone else to save you – you put in the work so **you** can be part of the solution. From learning first aid to securing your home, self-reliance is about being an asset to your group, not a liability. (Importantly, self-reliance does _not_ mean isolation; it’s about strengthening the individual _so they can better contribute to the team_.)
    
- **Teamwork:** We rely on and support each other because community strength is key. FPA operates in **squads** and chapters – small teams that trust each other like family. You’ll train together, share burdens, and have each other’s backs. In a crisis, one person alone can only do so much, but a well-prepared team can achieve what individuals can’t. Teamwork also means communication and respect up and down the chain – you follow leaders when needed and step up to lead when called.
    
- **Continuous Improvement:** Preparedness is a journey, not a one-time checklist. FPA members are always training, learning, and adapting. There’s no “done” – when you master one skill, you move to the next. We conduct after-action reviews following drills to find weaknesses, we stay updated on new techniques, and we embrace constructive criticism. This principle keeps us humble (there’s always more to learn) and resilient (we evolve as new challenges arise).
    

These principles form our common ethical framework. They’re not just words on paper – you’ll see them in action. For example, **fairness** drives our unique membership fee system (everyone pays a small share and that share drops as more join – more on that below). **Teamwork** is why we form squads and require participation in group drills. **Continuous improvement** underpins our training programs and the **Alliance Points** system that rewards active members. Whenever tough decisions come up – say, whether to share supplies with an outside family, or how to handle a negligent member – we refer back to these core values. By adhering to them, we maintain unity and purpose, especially in crisis moments when it would be easy to panic or turn selfish.

## FPA Structure at a Glance

The FPA is organized to balance local autonomy with national coordination. Here’s the basic structure:

- **Squads:** At the local level, members form small teams called squads. A squad is typically a handful of people in the same area (often neighbors, friends, or folks from the same town). This is your immediate preparedness team – you’ll train together regularly and likely be the first to rely on each other in an emergency. Squads have informal leaders (often the most experienced member or the one who started the group), but the leadership style is collaborative. The squad structure ensures everyone has a tight-knit support group that knows their specific needs and locality. _Squads know their area best and can respond fastest when something happens nearby._
    
- **Chapters/Regions:** Several squads in a geographic area make up a **region**, sometimes referred to as a local chapter if they operate jointly. For example, all squads in one county or city might collectively form the FPA Chapter for that area. Among them, they’ll have a **Regional Coordinator** or chapter lead (an experienced member, often around the rank of E-7, see ranks below) who facilitates communication across squads. The region level organizes larger training events, helps redistribute resources where needed, and ensures that if one squad is hit hard by a disaster, neighboring squads come to help. The key is **regional coherence** – squads remain mostly autonomous for local matters, but they cooperate at the regional level for bigger efforts.
    
- **Alliance Council (National):** At the top, the FPA has a central leadership council composed of the highest-ranked members (E-8s and E-9s, typically founders and proven leaders). The **Alliance Council** sets overall strategy, establishes standards (like this Compass Guide, training curricula, and certification requirements), and handles coordination between regions. They don’t micromanage individual squads, but they provide the playbook and support that keep all the local units moving in the same direction. The Council also oversees national initiatives – e.g. securing partnerships, approving major policy changes, and managing any shared resources that span regions. Think of them as the steering committee ensuring the alliance stays true to its mission and grows effectively.
    

This tiered structure – **squad → region → council** – allows information and resources to flow efficiently. Local squads handle immediate issues and report needs up to their region; regions allocate support or escalate big issues to the council. The council disseminates guidance and resources down to regions, which then adapt them to local squads. We maintain **local autonomy** (because a small town’s needs in a wildfire differ from a city’s needs in a blackout) while still having a unified alliance-wide game plan. No member is an island: if your squad struggles, the wider FPA has your back; and if the FPA sets a protocol, it’s there to help your squad succeed.

**Roles and Ranks:** To make this work, FPA uses a **ranking system** for members, similar to how the military or Scouts use ranks to denote experience and responsibility. Don’t let this intimidate you – ranks in FPA aren’t about bossing people around; they’re about recognizing who has put in the work and who can lead when needed. Every member starts at **E-1** (Entry Level 1) upon joining. As you train and contribute, you earn promotions through E-2, E-3, and so on, up to E-9 (the highest enlisted rank, usually national leaders). Above E-9 there is an **Officer tier** for those who take on executive leadership roles, but that comes into play only as the alliance grows into later phases. For now, most members will progress through E-1 (novice) up to around E-5 or E-6 (local leadership). We’ll cover more on ranks and the **Alliance Points (AP)** system that drives promotions later. The main idea is that rank isn’t about ego – it’s a measure of trust and contribution. Higher-ranked members mentor others and assume more responsibilities; new members focus on learning and following guidance. The system is meant to be **meritocratic and transparent** – if you do the work, you will advance.

_(For details on every rank and how to earn it, see the **Ranks** section of the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]].)_

## Why We Do It This Way

Every rule, system, and practice in the FPA exists for a reason. This section explains the rationale behind our key approaches – essentially the “why” of the FPA. Understanding this will help you commit to the program not because someone told you to, but because you **genuinely believe in its logic and purpose**. Here are the cornerstone choices we’ve made and why they matter:

- **Local Squads for Resilience:** We organize into small squads because in an emergency, _your neighbor is more valuable than a distant expert_. A tight local team can respond faster and more effectively than a large remote organization. Squads build trust – you know exactly who has your back at 3 AM when the floodwaters rise. This cell structure also makes us resilient: even if higher communication fails, each squad can operate independently. It’s the opposite of a top-heavy system. History and disaster research show that community groups save lives long before national aid arrives. FPA squads embrace that truth.
    
- **Shared, Fair Resources:** FPA emphasizes **fairness** in knowledge and resource sharing. We created the **SHTF Bible** (our comprehensive survival manual) and the **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]** so that _everyone_ has access to critical information, not just a select few “experts.” We expect members to share tips, lessons learned, and even supplies when needed. Why? Because hoarding information or gear might give one person an edge, but sharing it gives the _whole community_ a fighting chance. In a true catastrophe, one family’s stockpile won’t rebuild a town – but an entire town’s combined skills and supplies just might. We do it the fair way because it’s the smart way for group survival.
    
- **$5 Membership & Dynamic Fees:** You might wonder why we charge a **$5/month membership fee** (and why it isn’t free). That $5 – the cost of a sandwich – serves a purpose: it keeps our operations funded _without_ relying on big donors or turning us into a commercial enterprise, and it gives each member a bit of skin in the game. Most importantly, the fee is **capped and will drop** as we grow. The FPA has a **fair-share pricing model**: we only ever need $100,000/month to run core operations, so as more people join, the cost per person goes down. At Phase 1 (up to 20k members), it’s $5. In Phase 2 (after 20k members), we switch to dynamic pricing – for example, at 50k members it might be $2 each; at 100k members, $1 each. In Phase 3 (once we’d be below $1), the membership will vote to eliminate fees entirely. We do this to live up to our name – _fair_ preparation – so money is never a barrier to joining​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. The small fee we ask early on goes straight into tools, training materials, and mutual aid supplies for members. And by having even a token fee, we filter in people who are serious (you’d be surprised how many freeloaders disappear when even a minor payment is involved). It’s a commitment device for you and a sustainability plan for the Alliance. You know exactly where your money goes: keeping the FPA independent and effective, _never bloated_. (All finances are transparently tracked on our live public audit feed – you can literally see the budget in real time.)
    
- **Action-Based Ranking (No Free Riders):** The FPA uses an **Alliance Points (AP)** system to make sure rank progression is tied to real contributions, not popularity or nepotism. We all know talk is cheap – what counts is **doing**. Alliance Points are how we quantify “doing.” Every time you complete a training module, attend a drill, help your squad, contribute a useful idea, or otherwise benefit the community, you earn AP. Hit certain AP milestones (and requisite skills) and you get promoted to the next rank. Why do we do this? Because it motivates continuous engagement and weeds out pretenders. If someone just wants to wear a cool patch but not put in work, they’ll stagnate at E-1 and likely leave. Meanwhile, the person quietly accumulating points by showing up and helping out will rise – and those are exactly the people we _want_ leading. The AP system gamifies things a bit (it’s satisfying to see your points grow), but it’s closely monitored to keep it healthy. Cheating or chasing points for ego won’t get you far; tasks are verified (by peers or evidence), and the culture is very much “we earn these badges to serve, not to brag.” In short, **AP and ranks keep our members accountable**. You’ll always know who has proven experience, and you’ll always know what you need to do to reach the next level. It’s preparation turned into a tangible progression, which keeps it fun but also fair.
    
- **Partial AI, Not AI Dependence:** We embrace technology – including artificial intelligence – but **with caution and purpose**. The FPA has an AI assistant (“FPAi”) and planning tools (like **Test My Plan**) that are incredibly useful for training and scenario simulation. However, we deliberately call Phase 2 “partial AI” because we augment human decision-making with AI, we don’t replace it. Why? Because technology can fail or misguide if unrestrained. Our approach is: use AI in planning and analysis _before_ a crisis (to crunch data, suggest improvements, personalize training), but when the grid is down or lives are on the line, we fall back on human leadership and pre-printed, verified plans. You’ll see this reflected in our protocols – e.g., our AI might evaluate your emergency plan and point out weaknesses (so you can fix them now), but come “Day Zero” (disaster day), you’ll be executing a plan you understand fully, not asking an AI what to do. We also keep AI’s role transparent. In Phase 3 (“full AI integration”), we intend for AI to help even more with coordination as our membership scales into the tens of thousands – _yet even then_, it remains a tool under human oversight. The FPA’s stance is that **human judgment, especially guided by ethics and real experience, remains supreme**. We use AI to get better, never to get lazy. (Plus, all critical AI-derived info is available offline in print, because if the AI or internet is unreachable, we don’t get caught empty-handed.)
    
- **“Offline First” Preparedness:** Everything we do has a redundant, offline fallback. The fancy app, the cloud database, the websites – those are conveniences. But if the power and internet go out (and we plan as if they will), the FPA still operates. We insist on old-school backups: **HAM radios** for communication when phones die, printed **SOP manuals** and SHTF Bible excerpts for when websites aren’t reachable, physical maps when GPS is down, and clear human command chains for when we can’t teleconference. This philosophy is summed up in our internal saying: _“No phone? Radio works. No server? Printed ops ready. No internet? Outernet live. No leader? Squad adapts fast.”_ In practice, we hold regular drills where we simulate “grid-down” conditions – no one can use electronics, and we see how well plans hold up. By doing that, we identify weak points and fix them. We choose this approach because history shows critical systems fail in major crises. If your preparedness plan lives in a smartphone app or in your head alone, it’s fragile. The FPA way is to have layers: tech where available, muscle memory and paper where not. It’s more work to maintain two of everything (e.g., updating a digital plan and printing copies), but it’s worth it. You’ll thank us the day a solar flare wipes out half the electronics – your solar charger might fry, but that laminated water-purification guide in your pocket will still save your life.
    
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** We codify best practices into checklists and drills so that every member knows _exactly_ what’s expected. From day one, you’ll have a **Personal SOP Checklist** (a step-by-step to get yourself up to speed – see the **[[Personal SOP Checklist]]** note) and your squad will follow **Team SOPs** for group activities. Why so formal? Because when chaos hits, you fall back on training. Having written SOPs that everyone follows means we react faster and more cohesively under stress. It removes ambiguity – instead of debating what to do during a wildfire evacuation, you already have a plan and each person a role, as laid out in the SOP. These procedures are living documents; we improve them continuously as we learn. But we’ve seen them work: for example, one of our squads followed the playbook during a sudden blackout – everyone knew who would get the generator, who would check on the elderly neighbor, where the rendezvous point was – all predetermined. The crisis went from panic to a coordinated response in minutes, _because of SOPs_. We design our SOPs to be realistic (no superhuman tasks), modular (adaptable to different scenarios), and straightforward (checklists, not convoluted manuals). By internalizing them, you gain confidence – you _know_ what to do and that your teammates do too. This discipline is what separates effective preparedness groups from ad-hoc crowds.
    
- **Transparency and Trust:** FPA is built on trust – in each other and in the organization itself. That’s why we run things transparently. As mentioned, finances are public within the group (everyone can see where funds go). Decision-making is documented, major changes are put to vote as the Alliance grows, and even our fail-safes for leadership are clear (e.g. if a leader goes down or goes rogue, we have succession protocols and council oversight). We explain this in the Compass Guide because members need to know they’re part of something fair and stable. In a world where many institutions have lost credibility, we aim to earn and keep trust by showing we have nothing to hide. For example, if a region leader has to allocate relief supplies unevenly, they’ll later report why (“Squad A got more water because Squad B was already stocked”). This openness prevents resentment and rumor. It also holds each of us accountable – if you know your squad’s readiness report will be seen by neighboring squads, you’re more likely to keep your gear in shape. We do things above-board, even in a crisis, because it solidifies group cohesion. Dishonesty or secretiveness is corrosive; we can’t afford that. By being transparent, we reinforce our integrity principle and make it easy for good actors to shine and bad actors to be spotted quickly.
    

In summary, **the FPA way has been engineered through hard lessons and practical logic**. None of these systems – small squads, fair sharing, token dues, merit-based rank, hybrid AI use, offline backups, strict SOPs, radical transparency – are arbitrary. Each addresses a specific problem that has tripped up other efforts or could threaten our mission. The Compass Guide exists to spell out these whys, so that when you follow an FPA rule, you’re not doing it “because I said so,” but because you understand the solid reasoning behind it. If you ever catch yourself wondering “Why does the FPA do X?”, check back here – chances are it’s explained. And if it’s not, ask! (Chances are _you_ found a way to improve us – and continuous improvement means we’ll adapt and add a new explanation for it.)

## Phase 1, 2, 3 – Growing with Purpose

From its inception, the FPA has envisioned its development in **three phases**. This scaling plan ensures we stay effective as we grow from a handful of people to a nationwide network augmented by AI. Each phase has a focus and we explicitly adjust how we operate at each stage:

- **Phase 1: Grassroots Foundation (Current).** We are in Phase 1 now. This is the bootstrap phase – we rely entirely on human effort, local initiative, and basic technology. Our member count is relatively small (tens or hundreds, aiming up to a few thousand). In Phase 1, every member is expected to be very hands-on: organizing local meetups, manually sharing printed materials, doing things “the hard way” if needed. Our AI tools are in development or limited release, and our budget is tight, so we prioritize. The emphasis is on building a **strong culture and proof of concept**. We solidify our SOPs, demonstrate successful responses in local incidents, and iron out any kinks in training programs. This phase also locks in the “legacy” membership – those who join early (e.g., first 500 members) earn permanent legacy status and influence. The $5 monthly dues and volunteer labor sustain us. In Phase 1 you might wear many hats – one day you’re recruiting friends, the next day you’re learning to operate a HAM radio, all while holding a regular job and family obligations. It’s a grass-roots hustle, but it forges the core community.
    
- **Phase 2: Growth and Partial Automation.** Phase 2 kicks in as we surpass roughly 5,000 members (scaling up to ~50,000). Here, we begin deploying **partial AI support** and more structured organization to handle the larger membership. We roll out the full FPA app with integrated FPAi assistant to all members, providing things like automated plan reviews (**Test My Plan**) and personalized training suggestions. However, we still maintain human oversight on all AI outputs. Organizationally, new ranks come into play – the full E-1 through E-9 enlisted ladder fills out in this phase, and top contributors might transition into **Officer ranks** (O-1, O-2, etc.) to take on broader leadership beyond their local region. We introduce **specialized roles**: some members become trainers (E-8 “Trainer” role), communications coordinators (E-7 “SignalNode”), etc., as the alliance’s needs diversify​file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. With more members, we also increase inter-squad coordination: regional exercises involving multiple squads, and mid-level councils at state or provincial levels possibly forming. Funding-wise, Phase 2 is when our dynamic fee system is active – each new thousand members slightly lowers everyone’s cost. We also start bringing in alternate funding (sponsors, merchandise, donations) to supplement or eventually replace member dues. The key danger in Phase 2 is complexity – but we tackle it by **standardizing where needed and leveraging tech for management**. We’ll use databases to track gear caches, AI to flag training gaps, and likely have a dedicated admin team in the council. Culturally, we must guard our values diligently now; with many new folks joining, the Compass Guide and mentoring by Phase-1 veterans ensure the ethos remains intact. Think of Phase 2 as the adolescence of FPA – rapid growth, exciting new capabilities, but needing guidance to not go astray.
    
- **Phase 3: National Network & Full Integration.** Phase 3 is our mature state – tens of thousands to 100k+ members, an established presence in communities across the country, and heavy integration of advanced systems (while still human-led). In Phase 3, FPA could be a household name in preparedness. We operate a full-blown **“Outernet”** – an independent emergency communication network likely anchored by amateur radio frequencies (e.g. a nationwide HF radio schedule on 7.200 MHz and regional nets) that keep information flowing even if the entire internet crashes. Our AI systems reach a level of **full integration** behind the scenes: for example, real-time analysis of national logistics (perhaps helping route supplies from one region to another before a disaster hits), predictive modeling to warn squads of emerging risks, and maybe an AI-coordinated incident command system that can assist local leaders during crises. However, the AI remains advisory – final decisions lie with elected or appointed human leaders in the alliance. By Phase 3, membership fees are likely $0 (we’ll have executed a transition to sponsor and donor funding with member approval). The alliance governance might even evolve to an open model where members vote on major issues (with guidance from AI analytics to digest options). **Transparency and democracy** become even more important at this scale, to avoid any perception of the FPA becoming a bureaucracy or fiefdom. We will also see an **Officer Corps** taking shape – experienced E-9s moving into roles like regional directors (O-5, O-6) and a national executive team (O-9, O-10) who handle cross-region decisions. Essentially, the structure starts resembling a volunteer emergency service organization spanning the country. Phase 3 also involves external partnerships: working alongside government emergency agencies, Red Cross, CERT teams, etc., as a respected auxiliary force. Throughout Phase 3, the Compass Guide’s principles are our compass (pun intended) – with so many moving parts, those core values ensure we never lose sight of our founding purpose: _neighbors helping neighbors survive and recover, fairly and together._ By the end of Phase 3, the goal is that the FPA can handle a full-blown national disaster with the same confidence and coordination that a single squad handles a local storm in Phase 1.
    

_(There is a concept of “Phase 4” where the alliance transitions to a self-governing, AI-optimized system beyond 100k members, but that’s far in the future – essentially an open-governance era where our structure becomes very flexible. For now, Phases 1–3 give us a clear roadmap.)_

By understanding these phases, you as a member know not just where we are today, but where we’re headed. It helps to put things in perspective. For example, if some processes seem a bit manual or rough around the edges right now (Phase 1), you know it’s because we prioritize action and real-world testing over polish – and that improvements (Phase 2 automation) are on the horizon once we have the manpower. Conversely, if you hear about grand ideas like AI-driven logistics or nationwide networks, you know those are Phase 3 aspirations being built step-by-step, and you can find ways today to contribute to laying that groundwork (like getting your HAM license to be part of the Outernet project eventually).

Each phase builds on the previous one; nothing gets scrapped, only strengthened. Phase-1 grassroots grit will always be in our DNA, even when fancy tools come in Phase 3. The Compass Guide will be updated as we transition phases, but its job remains the same: to keep our mission clear and our methods justified to every member coming on board.

## Conclusion: Keeping Your Bearing

The Compass Guide isn’t meant to be read once and forgotten. It’s a document to live by. In calm times, it might just seem like common sense guidelines; in crisis times, it becomes the voice in your head reminding you why we do what we do. When the pressure is on – maybe resources are scant, or fear and rumors are running wild – that’s when you’ll lean on these principles and explanations the most. They will help you make the hard calls: choosing cooperation over selfishness, action over paralysis, and fact over fiction.

By joining the FPA, you’ve agreed to uphold a certain standard. The Compass Guide is the contract of that standard. If you ever find yourself or a fellow member drifting off-course, come back here, find the relevant section, and regain your bearing. The beauty of having this written down is that it removes ambiguity and debate over “the right thing to do” in the FPA – we’ve thought it through, we’ve learned from others’ mistakes, and this is our collective wisdom.

Lastly, remember that the Compass Guide, like everything in FPA, is a _living document_. It can be refined. As you gain experience, you might have insights that make their way into the next edition. In that sense, every member is an author of our alliance’s story and its rules. Stay committed, stay curious, and never hesitate to ask “why?” – because that question is the reason this guide exists.

_Stay safe, stay fair, and stay prepared._ Together, we’ll navigate whatever comes, true to our compass.

### 🔧 Canonical Patch (Non-Destructive)
> Canonical term referenced: [[TERM:TMP (Test My Plan)]]

Add this line under **Checkpoints** in the Compass SOP structure:
- **Checkpoints:** Verification steps, Triggers, Pulse Checks, [[TERM:TMP (Test My Plan)]] simulations

This ensures TMP linkage without overwriting original content.

### PATCH 2025-05-01 5ab2e4

The Compass Guide serves as the orientation vector for all Mk1Mod3 members navigating operational and governance protocols. It integrates the foundational logic of [[TERM:Trust Doctrine]], squad structuring principles from the [[TERM:Squad Wheel]], and real-time readiness metrics derived via [[TERM:OpCheck]].

---

### Embedded Readiness Logic

Compass alignment is not symbolic—it reflects synchronized compliance with:

- **OpCheck cycles**: All SOP adoption phases must show green in the latest [[TERM:OpCheck]] before member-wide rollout. Failed checkpoints delay procedural integration.
- **Squad Wheel mapping**: SOPs must denote how they affect team dynamics and whether redistribution of roles or redundancies are triggered.
- **Skill Delta tracking**: Each SOP includes an expected skill uplift. Squads are advised to rerun deltas after SOP integration to identify mismatch or lag.
- **Gear Pool impact**: If any SOP mandates new gear validation, it must list sourcing, member burden, and fallback compatibility.

---

### Trust Calibration

Every SOP indexed here is subject to [[Trust Firewall System]]. That means:

- Edits require rank-suitable signoff (E7+ or officer depending on scope)
- Live drills must be logged with a "Trust Witness" if SOP revision follows a field incident
- Compass Guide patches must be versioned and timestamped on the [[TERM:Quick Sync SOP]]

Failure to observe trust calibration invalidates the SOP’s live status. Only TMP-aligned documents are reflected in squad briefings or Sync-reliant dashboards.

> Compass Guide entries are not philosophical—they define actual operational behavior under live deployment conditions.

#### Integrating Readiness Tools into SOP Navigation

The Compass Guide serves as a procedural bridge between static documentation and dynamic mission execution. To operationalize it fully, key readiness tools are now embedded in all SOP layers:

- **[[TERM:OpCheck]]**: Every SOP block includes pre-op and post-op OpCheck anchors to verify real-time capability.
- **[[TERM:Squad Wheel]]**: Team alignment checks are embedded into planning stages for multi-role coordination. Used especially in E5+ SOPs.
- **[[TERM:Skill Delta]]**: SOP tasks are tagged with delta flags based on elevation targets; deviations are auto-flagged in Sync Dashboard.
- **[[TERM:Gear Pool]]**: Each SOP lists required gear tiers. Members without authorized gear (based on elevation or TMP) are marked as "non-operational" for that segment.

These integrations ensure that SOP execution is:

1. **Validated** (checked against readiness and authorization)
2. **Team-synced** (mapped against Squad Wheel coherence)
3. **Adaptive** (skill deltas are used to assign stretch tasks or defer to backups)
4. **Bounded** (Gear Pool boundaries ensure task assignment fits actual kit access)

```markdown
| SOP Phase         | Tool Embedded     | Outcome Triggered                  |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| PRE-EXECUTION    | OpCheck           | Go/no-go readiness flag            |
| TEAM FORMATION   | Squad Wheel       | Role-load matching & sync lock     |
| TASK ASSIGNMENT  | Skill Delta       | Variance-based routing or flagging |
| GEAR VALIDATION  | Gear Pool         | Role lockout if unauthorized       |
| POST-EXECUTION   | OpCheck (again)   | Readiness signature + TMP update  |
```

By structuring every SOP around these tools, the Compass Guide becomes a live operational matrix—not just a checklist, but a contextualized mission interface.
