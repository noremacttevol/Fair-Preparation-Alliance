## Introduction and Vision

The Fair Preparation Alliance **Skill Wheel and Knowledge Management** system (abbreviated **FPAKM**) is a comprehensive member profiling and training platform designed to **enhance disaster preparedness through visual feedback, targeted learning, and honest assessment**. Every FPA member has a personal Skill Wheel in their profile – a quick-reference dashboard displaying their competencies across key survival domains. The vision is to **motivate lifelong learning and realistic readiness**. The Skill Wheel should reveal both a member’s strengths and their gaps, inspiring continuous improvement without fostering complacency or false confidence. This strategic plan outlines the system’s design, phased implementation, integration points, and guiding principles (drawing on internal FPA doctrines like the [[Trust Doctrine]]) to ensure the Skill Wheel and knowledge management components are effective, trustworthy, and aligned with FPA’s mission.

**Goals of the Skill Wheel system:**

- **Holistic Skill Visualization:** Represent each member’s proficiency in multiple core preparedness categories in one clear graphic (a “wheel”) anchored by their identity (badge, rank, call sign).
    
- **Personalized Readiness Insights:** Provide honest yet encouraging indicators of how prepared a member is (with no one ever shown at 0%, to preserve morale) and what their projected survivability might be in crises.
    
- **AI-Driven Guidance:** Leverage FPA’s AI (the **FPAi** assistant) to analyze each member’s skills against regional threats, assigning tailored survivability scores and suggested learning paths to improve those scores.
    
- **Integration with FPA Ecosystem:** Seamlessly tie the Skill Wheel into the FPA Mk1Mod3 structure – the mobile app, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the [[SHTF Bible]] knowledge base, the [[Test My Plan]] simulation tool, and the rank progression system – as well as offline tools like printed packets and Outernet broadcasts.
    
- **Phased Growth:** Implement the system in stages, from basic manual tracking (Phase 1) to a fully AI-integrated, automated platform (Phase 3). This phased approach allows us to scale capabilities while maintaining reliability (per the AI Reliability Plan) and member trust (per the [[Trust Doctrine]]).
    
- **Realism over Gamification:** Avoid vanity metrics or superficial badge-collecting; ensure the system rewards **real skill development and practical readiness**. The ultimate aim is not to “beat” or complete the wheel (since 100% is intentionally unattainable), but to continuously learn and stay prepared for the unexpected.
    

By achieving these goals, FPA will cultivate a culture of **continuous improvement, humility, and mutual trust** among members, thereby strengthening the alliance’s overall disaster resilience.

## Skill Wheel Design and Layout

### Visual Profile Element

The Skill Wheel is a prominent visual element on each member’s profile (visible in the app and printable formats). At the **center of the wheel** is the member’s personal identity: their **badge** (FPA insignia or rank emblem), **rank/title**, and **call sign** (unique identifier or nickname). This central area personalizes the wheel – it’s clearly _their_ readiness profile – and ties into the FPA rank structure (immediately conveying the member’s status in the Alliance).

### Wheel Segments (Core Categories)

Surrounding the center, the wheel is divided into segmented slices or rings. Each segment represents a **core skill category** critical to survival preparedness. For example, the core categories might include:

- **First Aid & Medical** – emergency medical response, trauma care, CPR, etc.
    
- **Communications (Comms)** – radio operation, signaling, emergency communication protocols.
    
- **Survivalcraft** – wilderness survival skills: shelter building, firecraft, foraging, water purification.
    
- **Navigation** – land navigation with map and compass, GPS use, route planning.
    
- _(Additional categories)_ – Depending on FPA’s scope, other segments could cover **Security/Self-Defense**, **Logistics & Supplies**, **Planning/Leadership**, **Engineering/Repair**, etc. The system is flexible enough to include all key domains defined in the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]].
    

Each segment is **color-coded** for quick recognition (e.g. First Aid could be red, Comms blue, Survivalcraft green, Navigation yellow, etc.), creating a vibrant and intuitive wheel. The colors align with common associations (red for medical, green for outdoors, and so on), helping members instantly identify which areas are well-developed and which are lacking.

### Progress Indicators

Within each category segment, a **filled portion** of the segment indicates the member’s current proficiency or preparedness level in that domain. This works like a radial progress bar: for example, if a member is roughly 50% proficient in First Aid, the First Aid segment will be filled about halfway outward from the center. A completely filled segment (reaching the wheel’s outer edge) represents 100% in that skill area. Importantly, **100% is an idealized target rather than an actually attainable state** – as discussed later, no member will ever truly reach 100%, reflecting the philosophy of ongoing improvement.

As members improve their skills, their wheel **“fills out”** accordingly, providing a tangible sense of accomplishment while making it easy to spot skill gaps (the unfilled portions of segments). To prevent discouragement, **no segment ever appears fully empty**. Per FPA policy, every member starts with a minimum **10% baseline** in each category – visually, a small sliver of each segment is filled in from the start. This baseline serves two purposes: it avoids the demoralizing appearance of a 0% skill (since no one in FPA is at absolute zero; even a novice has _some_ foundational knowledge), and it reflects that basic orientation training or common knowledge gives everyone at least a sliver of capability in all areas. For instance, a brand-new recruit who has completed the entry orientation would still see ~10% filled on all segments. This design choice reinforces confidence and acknowledges that **everyone has something to contribute**, while a completely blank segment could imply “you have nothing at all to offer here,” which is never true in a team context.

The **wheel’s overall layout logic** is optimized for clarity and practicality. Text labels for each segment (the category names) are placed along or just outside each slice. If viewing digitally, hovering or tapping on a segment can bring up a tooltip or details (e.g. the exact percentage and a list of sub-skills or qualifications that make up that segment). This layered approach keeps the main graphic uncluttered, while allowing one-click access to deeper information.

For a clean visual look, the wheel may be depicted as a continuous ring encircling the member’s badge/rank center. A member who is exceptionally advanced in most areas will have a wheel that looks nearly complete – all segments mostly filled, forming an almost solid ring. A member with a mix of strengths and weaknesses will have a more jagged or uneven wheel shape – some segments reaching farther out, others shorter. This creates a unique **“skills profile shape”** for each individual. For example, one member’s wheel might bulge out in the “northwest” quadrant (indicating high First Aid and Comms skills) but be shallower in the “southeast” quadrant (indicating low Navigation skills) – visually encouraging them to focus on that weaker quadrant next.

This concept is analogous to competency “spider charts” or wheels used in other fields (such as career skill assessments or educational competency frameworks) where multiple domains of skill are visualized together. Those frameworks demonstrate that breaking competencies into broad categories and assessing each gives a more balanced view than any single aggregate number ([Domains and Leveled Core Competencies – Joint Task Force for Clinical Trial Competency](https://mrctcenter.org/clinical-trial-competency/framework/domains/)). The FPA Skill Wheel applies the same principle specifically to survival and disaster preparedness. By seeing a multi-dimensional profile rather than a one-dimensional score, members get clearer feedback on where to direct their efforts next.

## Core Skill Categories and Scoring Criteria

Each core category in the Skill Wheel is underpinned by a defined set of **skills and learning objectives** (outlined in internal FPA training manuals and in the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]). Defining these sub-skills and criteria is crucial so that percentages on the wheel are meaningful and standardized across the organization. For example, the **First Aid** category might consist of sub-skills like completing a basic first aid course, earning a CPR/AED certification, finishing a Stop-the-Bleed training, attaining Wilderness First Responder training, etc. The **Communications** category might include operating an FRS/GMRS radio, obtaining an amateur HAM radio license, knowing emergency frequencies and protocols, and so on. Similar detailed breakdowns exist for each category. These lists of requirements will be compiled from existing FPA curricula and resources (cross-referenced with the _[[SHTF Bible]]_ content and relevant SOPs) to ensure consistency between what is taught and what is measured.

**Scoring:** Within each category, a member’s percentage is determined by their progress in completing those defined sub-skills and objectives. In early phases, scoring will be a manual or semi-automatic process – for example, instructors or admins will input when a member completes a given requirement. By Phase 3, scoring becomes more automated and data-driven (with the AI verifying quiz results, checking logs of training drills, etc., as described later). Regardless of phase, **transparency in the scoring criteria** is critical for trust. Members should understand _what_ contributes to their score in each segment. To that end, we anticipate providing each member with a checklist or “skill journal” for every category. As they check off items (e.g. _“Complete CERT Basic Training”_ under First Aid, or _“Pass FPA Level 1 Radio Comms quiz”_ under Communications), their percentage in that segment increases accordingly. The system will make it clear how much each accomplishment is “worth.”

To keep the system **honest but motivating**, the scoring criteria are calibrated so that _reaching 50% in a category signifies a solid baseline competence; 75% represents an advanced skill set; and approaching 100% reflects mastery and exceptional breadth._ (In fact, “100%” is aspirational and likely unreachable in practice, as discussed below.) Members won’t receive points for trivial or unrelated activities – **every percentage point earned corresponds to a verifiable skill acquisition or achievement**. This addresses potential vanity metric issues by tying scores strictly to tangible outcomes. As emphasized in the [[Trust Doctrine]], **integrity of information** is paramount: the Skill Wheel must be a truthful reflection of ability, not inflated for feel-good effect. To uphold this, the initial calibration of scoring will involve input from subject-matter experts and perhaps a beta-test with a small group, to ensure the percentages genuinely correspond to real skill levels.

In some cases, categories may also confer **levels or badges** when certain milestones are reached. For example, the First Aid segment might display a small icon at 50% indicating “Certified First Responder,” or an icon at 80% for “EMT-Level Training.” These act as **micro-credentials** within the segment. However, to avoid encouraging a “collect badges” mentality over actual readiness, these indicators are kept subtle. They might appear only on a detailed view of the profile rather than on the main wheel graphic. The focus remains on the filled segment as a holistic measure of progress in that domain, rather than on a collection of individual badges.

## Data Inputs: Quizzes, Drills, and Demonstrations

The accuracy and value of the Skill Wheel depend on **multi-source data collection** about each member’s skills. There are three primary input sources that feed into the system, with a fourth supplementary source from plan evaluations:

1. **Knowledge Quizzes and Exams:** FPA will develop standardized quizzes for each skill domain (for example, a First Aid theory quiz, a Communications protocol quiz, etc.), eventually evolving into an [[Adaptive Quiz System]] that personalizes testing as members advance. These quizzes can be taken through the FPA app or during training sessions. When a member passes a quiz, the system awards a percentage increase in the corresponding skill segment. For instance, passing a “Basic Navigation Theory” test might contribute +5% to the Navigation segment. Quizzes provide an easy, objective measure of knowledge and allow the system to quickly baseline a member’s understanding in a topic. All quiz content will be derived from vetted FPA sources (aligned with the _SHTF Bible_ and official SOPs) to ensure consistency between what is taught and what is tested. In Phase 1, quizzes might be on paper or simple web forms with results manually recorded; by Phase 2, in-app quizzes will automatically update the Skill Wheel upon completion.
    
2. **Training Drills and Simulations:** Practical drills (hands-on trainings, workshops, or simulated scenarios) offer evidence of real **skill application**. For example, an FPA chapter might run a weekend field exercise where members practice land navigation or set up emergency communications. Instructors or team leaders overseeing the drill will verify each member’s participation and demonstrated skills. Completion of a drill yields a significant boost to the relevant skill segment – because actually _doing_ something in a realistic setting is more indicative of readiness than just passing a quiz. For instance, attending a “Wilderness Survival Weekend” and successfully performing key tasks might add +10% to the Survivalcraft segment. The system will provide an interface for instructors to log drill results (possibly with notes or scores for participants). Over time, as AI integration grows (Phase 3), we may incorporate **digital tracking** for certain drills – for example, using the mobile app to time how quickly a member can assemble a go-bag during a “grab-and-go” exercise, or letting members upload a photo of a successfully built emergency shelter as evidence of skill. Even as we add automation, human verification remains important (per the AI Reliability guidelines), so any automated assessments would be cross-checked by an instructor to avoid giving false credit.
    
3. **Real-World Skill Demonstrations:** Nothing proves capability like **real-world experience**. If a member has actually _used_ a skill in an emergency or major project, that should be recorded on their profile. For instance, if a hurricane strikes a member’s town and they organize a neighborhood first aid station, or if they have to navigate their family to safety during a wildfire evacuation, those experiences deserve recognition. We do **not** want to encourage members to seek dangerous situations just to boost their scores, but FPA does want to capture when hard-earned experience is gained. In practice, regional coordinators or leadership could enter a “skill credit” for members who demonstrably applied their skills in a real event. For example, someone who successfully administered first aid at a car accident might earn a few points in First Aid (with proper documentation). Real-world demonstrations will likely contribute modestly per incident (since any single event may only cover part of a skill domain), but over time they add up – and they serve as **stories to share**, enriching the member’s profile beyond numbers. This ties into FPA’s [[Trust Doctrine]]: we operate on trust but verify. Significant real-world contributions might require verification (witness statements, after-action reports, or even news clippings for major events) before awarding credit, to prevent any fabrication.
    
4. **Personal Plan Simulations – “Test My Plan”:** In addition to the above, the **[[Test My Plan]]** tool within Mk1Mod3 can serve as an indirect input to the Skill Wheel. _Test My Plan_ is essentially an AI-driven simulation that evaluates a member’s personal emergency preparedness plan. If a member’s plan has glaring gaps that point to skill deficiencies, the system can reflect that in their Skill Wheel. For example, if the simulation finds their plan lacks an alternative communication method, it suggests a weakness in Communications knowledge – the member might not know how to set that up. The Skill Wheel could flag this (or even cap their Comms segment at a certain level) until they improve their plan and retest. Conversely, a well-crafted, thoroughly tested plan indicates the member can effectively apply their knowledge, which validates their skill levels. (We may not give an explicit percentage boost solely for a good plan, but it reinforces their existing scores and confidence.) This integration ensures that _planning and execution are linked_: it’s not enough to have isolated skills, one must integrate them into a coherent personal plan. In the future, we might even add a badge or tag on the profile (such as “Plan-Tested”) to denote that the member has successfully combined their skills in a scenario. This encourages members to not just learn in the abstract, but to put their skills to use in their own lives – closing the loop between knowledge and preparedness action.
    

All these data inputs are aggregated and managed in the system’s **Knowledge Management** backend. Essentially, each member builds a digital _transcript_ of their preparedness training: quiz scores, drill records, plan evaluations, etc. The Skill Wheel is the front-end visualization of that transcript. The backend will apply weighting rules to combine these inputs into the segment percentages. For example, within a given category we might decide that quizzes can contribute up to, say, 30% of the segment, hands-on drills up to 50%, and real-world experience up to 20%. This would ensure that hands-on skills carry the most weight in the long run. The exact weighting schema will be determined in the detailed design phase (and will likely be documented in an internal design reference, such as the SHTF Bible’s design appendix or training manual, to maintain transparency).

One key policy is that **a member’s Skill Wheel segment should not decrease without cause.** Skills don’t just vanish overnight, so the system will not arbitrarily lower someone’s percentages unless there’s a reason. However, we will implement reasonable **decay or expiration rules** for certain time-sensitive qualifications. For instance, if your CPR certification expires after two years, the system might deduct a couple of points from your First Aid segment until you renew it. This introduces the concept of **recurring training** to maintain one’s scores, which is common in both military and medical fields. It prevents a situation where someone’s wheel remains full based on training they did a decade ago but might now be rusty at. By Phase 3, the AI could actively prompt members when a skill refresh is due – for example, _“It’s been 18 months since your last radio communications drill; consider scheduling another to maintain your Comms proficiency.”_ In short, the system encourages upkeep: if you don’t use it, you _do_ slowly lose it (and you’ll be nudged to refresh it).

## Integration with FPAi (AI Readiness Analysis)

Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the Skill Wheel system is its integration with **FPAi** – the Alliance’s AI-driven preparedness analysis engine (which functions as a kind of expert advisor or chatbot for members). The Skill Wheel provides rich raw data about **who knows what, and how well**. FPAi will transform that data into actionable intelligence: namely, **Projected Survivability Scores** and **Personalized Learning Paths** for each member.

### Projected Survivability Score

The **Projected Survivability Score** is an AI-generated metric estimating a member’s likelihood of surviving various disaster scenarios given their current skill profile (and assuming they utilize FPA’s support and resources). FPAi calculates this by considering the member’s Skill Wheel – their strengths and weaknesses – _and_ factoring in **regional threat profiles** specific to that member’s environment. For example, a member living in a coastal hurricane zone will be evaluated against the skills needed for hurricanes and flooding, whereas a member in an earthquake-prone region will be evaluated for earthquake preparedness. The survivability score might be presented as an overall percentage (and possibly also broken down by scenario type).

We conceptually define **50%** as roughly _“likely to survive a moderate disaster if FPA is active and can assist.”_ In other words, a member at ~50% proficiency in most areas has solid basics and would likely pull through a crisis especially with community support, but might struggle in extreme scenarios without help. **75%** would mean _“very likely to survive in most disasters”_ – this member has a well-rounded and advanced skill set, potentially able to handle many emergencies solo and even lead others. Reaching ~75% in all categories is a major achievement, marking a veteran member; still, it’s not an absolute guarantee because there could always be scenarios that overwhelm even a well-prepared individual. **100%**, as noted, is intentionally **unattainable** – no one can be fully prepared for _everything_. The system will never actually display “100%” even if a member checks every box; practically, it might cap at 99%. This ceiling is a deliberate reminder of humility: it echoes the [[Trust Doctrine]] emphasis on honesty (no false certainty). There’s always some scenario or extreme condition that could challenge even the best-prepared person. By never showing 100%, the system subtly reminds members that there is no such thing as total invincibility. The goal is _continuous improvement_, not an end point.

In computing these scores, the AI cross-references the member’s skills with a knowledge base of what’s required to survive specific situations (this knowledge base comes from historical data, expert input, and models that FPAi has been trained on). For instance, suppose historical data or expert guidelines indicate that surviving a severe winter blizzard requires at least 40% competency in First Aid (for treating frostbite or hypothermia), 50% in Survivalcraft (for keeping warm, managing a heat source safely, etc.), and some level of Comms (to call for help or coordinate). If the member meets or exceeds those thresholds, their likelihood of making it through is high; if they fall short in one area (say they lack medical know-how), that area becomes a vulnerability pulling down their overall survival projection. Importantly, FPAi will be **transparent** in how it derives the score. Instead of just giving a number, it will provide an explanation such as:

> _“Overall Survivability: 68%. **Strengths:** Navigation and Comms are high (these will help in most scenarios). **Risks:** Below-average medical skills could pose an issue in common regional threats (e.g. earthquake-related injuries).”_

This explanatory component is crucial – per the AI reliability guidelines, any AI-generated assessment must be explainable and interpretable by the member and FPA leadership. It cannot be a mysterious black box. Members will see _why_ the AI rated them a certain way, which in turn maintains trust in the system’s fairness and accuracy.

### Personalized Learning Paths

Based on the member’s identified skill gaps and personal context, FPAi will also suggest a tailored **Personalized Learning Path**. This is essentially a custom training and development plan generated for the individual. It could include recommended training courses, specific study materials, or even mission assignments that would help boost particular segments of their Skill Wheel.

For example, if the AI flags that a member’s First Aid skills are low relative to the flood risks in their region, it might recommend something like: _“Complete the Flood Response First Aid module (see Chapter 4 of the [[SHTF Bible]]) and attend the upcoming Red Cross disaster medicine workshop in your area.”_ If Navigation is the weak link for someone living in wildfire country, the AI might suggest, _“Join the next orienteering hike with your local FPA squad to practice land navigation.”_ These suggestions essentially create a **custom curriculum** for each member, focusing their efforts on the most impactful improvements first – much like a personal coach saying “here’s your next drill.” The recommendations will draw from FPA’s own resources (like chapters of the SHTF Bible, local FPA training events) as well as external opportunities (reputable courses or certifications) to fill in the gaps.

This adaptive approach is informed by competency-based education practices: tracking specific competencies allows training to be tailored to an individual’s needs. In education, for instance, knowing exactly which skills a student is lacking means an instructor can target those areas rather than re-teaching what the student already knows. Studies in fields like healthcare education emphasize that competency tracking promotes comprehensive improvement and confidence by focusing on weaknesses. We apply the same principle via AI – identifying each member’s weaknesses and actively guiding them to improve – thereby raising overall preparedness. As the member follows these tailored recommendations and logs new completions, FPAi will update their Skill Wheel and survivability score accordingly, creating a motivating feedback loop of improvement.

### Regional Threat Integration

A standout feature of the AI analysis is how it accounts for **regional threats and context**. When a member joins, their profile will include at least a general location or environment type (e.g. coastal, urban, suburban, wilderness). We do **not** need precise coordinates – just enough context to personalize the risk profile. FPAi uses this context to weight the importance of certain skills for that member. For example, **Navigation** might be absolutely critical for someone living in remote Montana (where getting lost could be fatal and help is far), but slightly less critical for someone in Manhattan (where navigation mostly involves knowing evacuation routes and public transit, and one is rarely far from help). Conversely, **Communications** and community coordination skills might be weighted more heavily for an urban member who would need to coordinate with neighbors and authorities in a crisis. The system thus provides **contextualized feedback** – making training recommendations far more relevant than any one-size-fits-all program. Moreover, if a member moves or if threat patterns change over time (say wildfires become more frequent in their area), the AI can dynamically adjust the learning path and threat assessment for that member.

All AI-generated scores and suggestions are stored in the Knowledge Management System, and key insights are shared (securely) with the member’s squad leaders or designated mentors. This allows human leadership to **validate and adjust** the AI’s outputs if needed, an important safeguard outlined in the AI reliability plans. For instance, if FPAi suggests a course of action that a seasoned instructor in the field disagrees with, there will be mechanisms for that instructor to provide feedback or override the recommendation with a human judgment call. In effect, we have the AI **augmenting** human decision-making, not replacing it. This combination of AI analytics with human wisdom aims to deliver the best of both worlds, and it will increase member trust in the system’s recommendations. Members will know that there’s always a human in the loop who can clarify or correct the AI as necessary.

### Ensuring Trust and Appropriate Use

Finally, it’s important how we present and use these AI-driven insights within FPA’s culture. **Survivability scores will not be treated as a public ranking or judgment of a person’s worth.** They are a private developmental tool. We will communicate clearly to members that a lower score is not something to be ashamed of – it’s an opportunity to improve – and that these scores are kept private to the member (and perhaps their immediate team leaders or mentors). We will avoid any scenario where members start comparing scores (“I’m 80%, you’re only 60%”) as that could undermine teamwork. In fact, to prevent any “gamification” or competition around the survivability number, it may be displayed less prominently than the Skill Wheel itself. The wheel, which provides granular detail, remains the primary visual indicator on a profile. The survivability percentage might live in a personal dashboard or report view. This way, the emphasis stays on improving specific skills rather than chasing a composite number.

All of this aligns with the ethos of the [[Trust Doctrine]]. Every member should feel valued and supported regardless of their current level, and trust that the system’s purpose is to help them grow, not to call them out. The AI’s role is as a helper – a virtual advisor that members can turn to for guidance – not as some authority passing judgment. By phasing in these AI features gradually and keeping them transparent, we will encourage even initially skeptical members to see FPAi as a trusted assistant. Over time, as members experience the AI’s usefulness (for example, a tip that proved life-saving, or a training suggestion that significantly helped them), their trust in the technology will grow. We will always position FPAi as a tool under human control – it **augments, but does not replace, human judgment** in preparedness. In summary, the integration of AI into the Skill Wheel system will be done carefully and ethically, always upholding the Alliance’s values of trust, humility, and mutual support.

## Offline Sync and SHTF Bible Integration

A hallmark of FPA’s approach is an **“offline-first” resilience** mindset – we prepare for worst-case _grid-down_ scenarios. The Skill Wheel system is therefore designed to bridge online and offline worlds, ensuring that each member’s critical information and learning resources are available when they’re needed most, even if power or internet connectivity is lost. This aligns with the FPA [[Offline-First Resilience System]] principle that nothing should rely solely on active internet or electricity.

### Auto-Tailored Skill Cards

One key deliverable for offline use is a **personalized skill summary** for each member – essentially a one or two-page “cheat sheet” of their readiness profile that can be printed and kept in physical form. By Phase 3, the system will automatically generate these for every member (in earlier phases, they may be compiled manually). This summary, often envisioned as a **Skill Card** or part of the member’s binder (the “SHTF Bible” binder many members maintain), would include:

- The member’s **strengths** – highlighting which skills/domains they are strong in, so they know what they can confidently rely on.
    
- The member’s **caution areas** – noting which skills are weaker, so they know what not to overestimate in a crisis (and perhaps who else to rely on for those tasks).
    
- **Quick-reference guides** or key tips for those weaker areas.
    
- Any **immediate action checklists** recommended by FPAi given the member’s situation.
    

For example, if a member’s Navigation skill is low and they live in a wildfire-prone area, their tailored page might include a basic map-reading guide and an evacuation route checklist (pulled from the _SHTF Bible_ content on wildfires). If the same member’s Communications segment is high, the card might list their radio call sign and key frequencies or channels they monitor, so others could reach them. In effect, this personal summary is like a pair of crib notes: it reminds the member what they’re good at, what they should be careful about, and gives them essential info at a glance.

These Skill Cards would be formatted for easy printing (e.g. black-and-white friendly, minimal fancy graphics). Members could print and laminate them to carry in a go-bag or include in their emergency binder. The content for these cards would be generated by pulling from our knowledge base as appropriate. The _SHTF Bible_ (FPA’s comprehensive survival manual) is structured into chapters and modules on various threats and skills. Our Knowledge Management System knows which sections correspond to which skills. So, if FPAi determines “this member needs a refresher on X,” the system can automatically excerpt key points from the relevant SHTF Bible chapter to include on their card. It’s essentially an automated _“extract and summarize”_ process tailored to the individual. In Phase 1, doing this might involve an instructor manually selecting relevant pages for a member. By Phase 3, it will be fully AI-driven and kept up-to-date whenever the member’s profile changes.

### Synchronization with Outernet and Offline Devices

To support members who are off-grid, FPA plans to utilize low-bandwidth broadcast services (such as the “**Outernet**”) to push updates and information. _Outernet_, broadly speaking, is a concept for broadcasting internet content via satellite or other means for one-way offline reception (i.e., users with a simple receiver can get data without needing a two-way internet connection). In our context, if a member has an FPA-issued portable data receiver (or even just a radio tuned to FPA’s channel), we could periodically broadcast updates that include new training material or even updates to personal skill data, in a secure form.

For instance, suppose a member in the field completes a drill and later comes within range of a field HQ or relay – their device might send a tiny packet of data (“Member #12345 completed Drill X”). At the next scheduled Outernet broadcast, FPA could beam out an updated skill summary for that member (encrypted for their device). When the member’s receiver picks up that transmission, their offline app or device would update to show the new achievement. In another case, regular broadcasts might include generic updates like, “New chapter on cyber-security added to SHTF Bible, here’s the text,” or urgent alerts like, “Hurricane incoming – all coastal members, review your Comms and Medical segments now.”

Earlier-phase implementations of offline sync will be simpler. For example, we might use QR codes or short data bursts whenever possible: if a member briefly connects to any network, they could scan a QR code on their profile to pull down the latest data. Also, FPA teams deploying to a disaster zone with no internet could, **before leaving**, generate local copies of all team members’ Skill Wheels and guides on a rugged tablet or print them out as a dossier. The system will support exporting a batch of profiles to PDF or another portable format for exactly this scenario.

Integration with the _SHTF Bible_ is also part of offline strategy. Each skill category on the wheel corresponds to chapters or sections in the Bible. Ideally, the SHTF Bible (which exists in both printed handbook form and as a digital reference) includes self-study material and drills for each of those categories. We will ensure the **Knowledge Management System cross-links content** with the Skill Wheel data. For example, in the app, clicking on your First Aid segment could suggest _“Learn More: SHTF Bible Chapter 5 – Basic Trauma Care”_ as further reading. Conversely, while reading the digital SHTF Bible, a member could take a quiz at the end of the chapter with one tap, and that result would feed back into their Skill Wheel. This two-way integration reinforces learning: the knowledge base informs skill improvement, and the skill profile points back to the knowledge needed.

### Offline Packet Contents

Ultimately, every member will maintain an **offline readiness packet** (sometimes called a “go-binder” in preparedness circles). We envision the packet containing several components, which the Skill Wheel system will help compile and update:

- **Emergency Info Cover Page:** The member’s vital info like emergency contacts, call sign, blood type, allergies, etc. (This is standard personal preparedness info and may be managed outside of our system, but it would be included for completeness.)
    
- **Skill Wheel Summary:** A printout of the member’s Skill Wheel – possibly as the graphic itself or a simple table listing their skill percentages. This allows, for instance, team members to quickly assess each other’s capabilities if they convene during an emergency (“Who’s our strongest medic here?” can be answered by a glance at these sheets).
    
- **Personal Skill Card/Pages:** The individualized skill summary and tips described above, with tailored advice, quick guides, and checklists.
    
- **Key SHTF Bible Excerpts:** Crucial pages from the SHTF Bible relevant to that member’s context. For example, a coastal member’s packet might include a printed section on hurricane preparedness and flood response. A member in a wildfire zone might have the wildfire chapter. This ensures that, even if they can’t carry the entire manual, they have the most pertinent instructions on hand.
    
- **Relevant SOP Quick-Guides:** If the member has a particular role or high skill (say they are the go-to radio operator in their squad), include a one-page Standard Operating Procedure summary for that role (e.g. radio operation protocols, call logs templates, etc.). Essentially, whatever tasks they are most likely to perform in an FPA operation, they should have the instructions for those tasks in their packet.
    
- **Training Log and Certificates:** Copies of any important training certificates, course completions, or endorsements the member has earned (if space permits). This can serve as proof of qualifications if they need to interface with official responders or just to remind themselves of their accomplishments.
    

By automating as much of the creation of these packets as possible, we ensure consistency and up-to-date information. In Phase 2 or 3, whenever a member significantly improves a skill or earns a new qualification, the system could notify them: _“New achievement unlocked – print an updated page for your binder to reflect your First Aid training upgrade.”_ During annual readiness audits or trainings, leaders could prompt members to refresh their printouts, so everyone’s binder stays current.

All these offline integration efforts tie back to a central idea: **the Skill Wheel system must remain effective even when the lights go out.** It’s not sufficient to have a flashy app that only works in good times. FPA’s ethos, as reflected in documents like the Trust Doctrine, emphasizes redundancy and reliability. We don’t rely on any single medium or technology. By having both digital and physical (analog) representations of the data, we build confidence that the system is a practical tool under _all_ conditions – not just a tech gimmick. Members will trust the Skill Wheel system more knowing that it won’t abandon them when the internet is down; instead, it has already equipped them with the knowledge and references they need in hand.

## Motivation and Realism: Scoring Philosophy

A core principle guiding the Skill Wheel is to be **“honest but motivating.”** The percentages displayed on a member’s wheel are calibrated to mean something concrete in terms of survival capability, and the way we present those scores is intended to encourage progress without either complacency or despair.

We’ve internally defined rough benchmarks for overall preparedness levels:

- **50%** – signifies _“likely to survive if FPA remains active and can assist.”_ A member around 50% in most categories has a solid basic proficiency. In a moderate disaster scenario, especially with support from the FPA network (communications, supplies, guidance), this person stands a good chance. However, in extreme scenarios they would still be in trouble without help. 50% is essentially a competent beginner or intermediate survivor.
    
- **75%** – signifies _“very likely to survive in most disasters.”_ At ~75%, the member has a well-rounded and advanced skill set. They probably have multiple redundancies (backup skills, cross-training) and can handle many crisis situations independently. This level might be akin to an FPA expert or veteran member. Someone at 75% might even take leadership roles during emergencies. Still, this is not a guarantee of survival – there are always scenarios that can overwhelm even very prepared individuals.
    
- **100%** – intentionally **unreachable.** We frame 100% as an asymptote: you can approach it (90%, 95% perhaps with immense effort), but 100% represents theoretical perfect preparedness – something that doesn’t exist in reality. By never awarding a full 100%, the system reinforces a mindset of **lifelong learning and humility.** There’s _always_ something new to learn, some skill to refresh, or some edge to sharpen. Even top experts must respect that disasters are unpredictable. In practice, members might consider anything above ~90% as “maxed out,” but even then the system will show that small gap to perfection to encourage a growth mindset.
    

We will communicate this philosophy during member onboarding and training. It’s important that members understand the Skill Wheel is **not a game to be “beaten”** or an exam to get 100% on – it’s a mirror and map for personal preparedness. We plan to include explanatory notes in official references (possibly as entries in the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]] or the member handbook) about what different percentage ranges mean in plain language. This is similar to practices in some elite organizations (for example, certain military or special forces evaluations purposely avoid ever giving a “100/100” score) to keep people striving for improvement and acknowledging that conditions and requirements can evolve.

Additionally, the system will incorporate **positive reinforcement messaging** to keep motivation high. When a member improves a segment of their wheel, they might receive a congratulatory message or notification: “Great job – your First Aid skills are improving!” If a segment’s score drops (say, because a certification expired), the system will frame it as a supportive reminder: “Your First Aid certification has lapsed; time to refresh this skill to maintain readiness – you’ve got this!” The tone throughout is **encouraging, not punitive**. This aligns with FPA’s culture of mutual support and teamwork; the goal is to lift members up, not knock them down for shortcomings.

### Avoiding Complacency

One risk of introducing any scoring system is that high-performing members might become complacent – e.g. someone hits a comfortable number and then stops pushing further. We address this in several ways:

- **Unreachable 100%:** As described, the fact that no one can ever hit “100% complete” on their Skill Wheel sets the expectation that you are _never done_ training. Even the highest-ranked, most experienced members will always see a little slice of their wheel unfilled, which is a constant nudge that there’s more to learn.
    
- **Evolving Criteria:** We will update the skill criteria _very sparingly_ over time to reflect new knowledge or emerging threats. If the world changes – say a new technology becomes important (e.g. satellite-based texting devices), or a new type of risk appears – we might introduce a new sub-skill or even a new category to the wheel. This creates fresh room to grow for everyone. (We will be careful not to move the goalposts too often, as that would frustrate members; the idea is to evolve the system along with genuine changes in the preparedness landscape.)
    
- **Challenging Scenarios:** The AI’s survivability analysis can present new challenges to high performers. For example, a member who reaches 75% might start getting advanced scenario prompts from FPAi like, “You’re very solid – but could you handle _this_ extreme scenario?” This ensures that as someone improves, they are presented with increasingly tough hypotheticals, much like a coach upping the difficulty level. In essence, the system can “raise the bar” with scenario-based coaching so that nobody feels there are no further mountains to climb. It’s akin to how video games introduce harder levels as you master easier ones, preventing you from resting on your laurels.
    

### Avoiding Despair

On the flip side, a new member might join and initially see many segments hovering near that 10% baseline, which could feel overwhelming (“I’m so far from being prepared!”). We mitigate discouragement in a few ways:

- **10% Baseline:** As mentioned, everyone starts with at least some progress in every category. Psychologically, seeing even a little color in each segment conveys that they are _already on the journey_. No one is at zero.
    
- **Early Quick Wins:** The system is tuned to make the first steps relatively easy to achieve. The first few quizzes or basic trainings a member completes might each give a substantial boost to a segment (we sometimes call this the “low-hanging fruit” effect). This provides quick wins and positive reinforcement. For example, attending an introductory first aid class might bump a brand-new member’s First Aid segment from 10% to 30%. Those visible jumps can be very motivating. As their skills advance, each additional percentage will likely require more effort (just like how in many RPG games, the first levels are easy to gain and later levels require more experience). This proven model keeps people engaged – you get hooked with rapid initial progress and then you’re invested in pursuing the more challenging gains.
    
- **Mentorship:** FPA will leverage its community by pairing newcomers with experienced members as mentors or “battle buddies.” A mentor’s robust Skill Wheel serves as inspiration, and mentors can reassure new members that _everyone starts with small slices_ and builds up over time. Mentors will actively guide newbies through their initial trainings, helping them navigate the resources and perhaps training alongside them. This not only improves the newcomers’ skills faster but also shows them they’re not alone – it’s a team effort.
    

Throughout all our messaging, we emphasize that **the point of the Skill Wheel is not the number itself, but what you do with it.** An individual at 50% who is actively training, improving, and contributing to the group is far more valuable than a “75%” who has grown complacent. This perspective is reinforced in the [[Trust Doctrine]] and core FPA values like humility, continuous improvement, and service. We plan to incorporate snippets of those doctrines into the training materials around the Skill Wheel to continually remind members of the bigger picture. For instance, the Trust Doctrine highlights transparency and not giving false promises – we reflect that by giving realistic feedback (no inflated 100% scores) and openly acknowledging uncertainties. Similarly, the FPA Dictionary will define terms like “Survivability Score” and “Skill Wheel” with guidance on interpretation, ensuring a common understanding across the organization. In essence, we will build a culture around the Skill Wheel that keeps it in proper perspective: it’s a _tool_ to help you prepare, not a trophy or a label defining your worth.

## Implementation Plan: Phases 1 through 3

Implementing the Skill Wheel system will be a **gradual, phased process**. This allows us to learn and adjust as we go, and to build trust and reliability step by step. We have defined three major phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation – Manual & Verified (Year 1)

**Scope:** In Phase 1, the Skill Wheel is introduced in a simplified form, primarily as a manually-updated profile element. The focus is on establishing the core categories, defining basic scoring rubrics, and getting member buy-in through education and feedback.

- **Basic Wheel Rollout:** We will start by creating paper-based or static digital versions of the Skill Wheel for each member. For example, an instructor might fill out a printed wheel chart during a new member’s initial evaluation or orientation. Quizzes, if any, might be on paper or simple Google Forms, with instructors recording the scores afterward. The emphasis is on familiarizing everyone with the concept of the wheel.
    
- **Manual Verification:** During this phase, all inputs go through human verification. If a member claims a skill or certification (e.g. “I am CPR certified”), an instructor or admin will check the documentation and then mark their First Aid segment accordingly. This ensures data integrity from the outset and also helps refine our scoring process with expert oversight. Essentially, Phase 1 uses human judgment at every step to make sure the system’s foundation is solid.
    
- **Minimal Tech:** The FPA app/software at this stage might not be fully interactive with the wheel. It could be as simple as showing a static image or chart of the member’s wheel that an administrator updates periodically. Members won’t be updating their own profiles yet through the app.
    
- **Data Gathering & Pilot:** Phase 1 is also about gathering baseline data on our membership’s skills. We’ll analyze which categories tend to be strong or weak across the board and use that to adjust training focus or baseline assumptions. We may conduct a small-scale pilot (for example, one regional chapter or squad) before rolling out the wheel Alliance-wide. This pilot would provide feedback on the wheel’s design, how members react to seeing their skills quantified, and whether any adjustments are needed before broader adoption.
    
- **Member Orientation:** Members will be introduced to the Skill Wheel concept through meetings or training sessions. We will clearly explain its purpose – that it’s _not_ a competition leaderboard but a personal development tool. We’ll encourage questions and feedback. Early feedback from members is vital; if they find any aspect confusing or demotivating, we want to know and correct it now.
    

By the end of Phase 1, we expect to have all active members set up with an **initial Skill Wheel profile** (most likely documented by their squad leaders or instructors), and a general understanding throughout FPA of what the Skill Wheel is and why we’re using it. We’ll likely also have created some supporting documentation – for example, a section in the SHTF Bible or a pamphlet explaining how the system works, and entries in the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]] defining new terms introduced by the system. Success for Phase 1 is measured by acceptance and understanding: members should feel the wheel reflects them reasonably well, and leadership should have confidence that the concept is sound for scaling up.

### Phase 2: Integration – Digitize & Partially Automate (Year 2)

**Scope:** In Phase 2, we build out the technical infrastructure to support the Skill Wheel and start integrating it with other FPA systems. This is where the project shifts from a manually maintained idea to a dynamic software-supported platform.

- **App Integration:** The FPA mobile app will be updated to include a **Skill Wheel module**. Members will be able to log in and see an up-to-date visualization of their Skill Wheel on their dashboard. This will likely be one of the first things they see upon opening the app (e.g., “Welcome [Call Sign], here is your current Skill Wheel.”). Members will also be able to take quizzes directly in the app. Upon completing a quiz, the system will automatically update their corresponding segment. We’ll implement push notifications to gently nudge behavior (for example, “📋 Your Navigation skill is a bit low – consider taking the Land Nav quiz or attending a map-reading workshop.”).
    
- **Database-Backed System:** Behind the scenes, we’ll move from spreadsheets or manual records to a proper database. Each member’s skills, training activities, and achievements will be stored in a centralized system. Instructors and authorized volunteers will have accounts to input data (like drill results) directly. This removes the bottleneck of a single admin updating everyone’s profile. It also opens the door for more advanced data analysis and tracking.
    
- **Squad Dashboards (Part of [[Squad Tools]]):** We will develop leadership views so that squad leaders, regional coordinators, etc., can see the Skill Wheels of their team members at a glance. This might be presented as a roster with mini-wheel icons next to each name, or a summary table of percentages. These **Squad Tools** will be invaluable for planning and preparedness management. For example, a squad leader preparing for hurricane season could quickly identify which squad members have strong Medical or Comms skills and which might need extra training, helping assign roles or buddy pairs accordingly.
    
- **Integration with Test My Plan:** By this phase, we aim to have the [[Test My Plan]] simulation tool feeding data into the Skill Wheel system. Concretely, this means if the _Test My Plan_ analysis flags a deficiency in someone’s plan due to a skill gap, the system can reflect that. For example, if a member’s personal plan review indicates they didn’t include an alternate communications method, the system might flag their Comms segment for review or subtly reduce their effective Comms score until the issue is addressed. Conversely, if a member aces a rigorous plan simulation, the system could give a confidence boost or at least mark that their plan is verified. We’ll tread carefully here to keep it fair and not punitive, but the integration ensures the wheel isn’t isolated from practical planning efforts.
    
- **Proto-AI and Analytics:** While full AI integration comes in Phase 3, in Phase 2 we can start building simple analytics rules. For instance, we might implement a basic algorithm for a preliminary survivability score: e.g., “If First Aid >70% AND Navigation >70% AND all others >50%, then mark survivability as ~75%.” These kinds of rules (more complex than that example, but along those lines) can be tested internally. We might also run the AI in a “shadow mode” during this phase: FPAi generates recommendations or scores based on the data, but we don’t show them to members yet – instead, we give them to a few staff or beta testers to evaluate whether the AI’s advice is good. This way, when we officially launch AI features in Phase 3, we’ve already verified their quality.
    
- **Offline Preparedness:** We’ll begin implementing some of the offline features in Phase 2. For example, by the end of Phase 2 it’s reasonable to aim for every member’s physical SHTF binder to include a printout of their current Skill Wheel and a basic personal skill page. We might coordinate a one-time mailing or meeting where we distribute these printouts to all members, to test how they use them. This also gives us a chance to test our offline update process – for instance, during a nationwide drill or event, we can observe whether members reference their printed skill cards and if they find them useful in practice.
    

Phase 2 is essentially about **connecting the dots**. We transform the Skill Wheel from a standalone concept into something woven into daily FPA operations and technology. By the end of Phase 2, members should be regularly interacting with their Skill Wheel via the app, and leaders should be incorporating it into training plans and mission prep. We will also handle scaling challenges during this phase: ensuring our database can handle all members, implementing data security measures (so that privacy is maintained as more people access the system), and refining user roles/permissions (so members can see only their data, leaders can see their teams, etc., in line with FPA’s data policies).

### Phase 3: Automation & AI – Full Maturity (Year 3 and beyond)

**Scope:** In Phase 3, the system reaches full maturity. It becomes smart, adaptive, and deeply integrated with AI and even external data feeds, realizing the original vision of a living, learning preparedness ecosystem.

- **Full AI Integration:** The FPAi engine will be fully connected to the Skill Wheel system. Each member’s profile will automatically include the AI-generated survivability analysis and learning path recommendations described earlier. In the app, members might have a “My Readiness Report” section where they can see their current survivability score(s), the rationale behind them, and the personalized to-do list of training or actions to take next. The AI will draw on a wide array of data: not only the member’s skills and quiz results, but possibly their equipment inventory (if the app tracks what gear they have or if they contribute to a shared [[Gear Pool]]), their network (maybe noting if they have nearby mutual aid partners), and real-world threat intelligence. For example, if an impending winter storm is detected in their region, the AI could temporarily elevate the importance of certain skills or send a targeted reminder: “A blizzard is forecast this week – make sure your generator skills and supplies are in order.”
    
- **Advanced Dashboards for Command:** At this stage, we can develop higher-level views for regional and national leadership. These dashboards would aggregate data in anonymized form to give a picture of FPA’s overall readiness. For instance, national HQ might see a “Skill Readiness Index” by region – highlighting if a particular region is lagging in medical training, or if another region excels in navigation, etc. This helps in resource allocation (e.g., sending traveling instructors to the areas that need improvement). We will implement these carefully to avoid any misuse of data – it’s meant for supporting and focusing training efforts, not for shaming chapters. Any public or organization-wide stats will be anonymized and framed positively (like identifying needs and offering help).
    
- **Robust Outernet Sync:** We will roll out the sophisticated offline sync capabilities. By Phase 3, it’s conceivable that FPA might distribute a small, dedicated receiver device or at least an app update that enables members to receive satellite broadcasts of updates. These broadcasts, as discussed, could include not just static content but personalized messages. For example, in the event of a disaster affecting multiple members, FPA HQ could broadcast an emergency packet that each member’s device picks up and customizes: _“Hurricane incoming in 48 hours. [Your weakest skill] is [X]; review the attached summary from your offline card. Also, remember to reach out to [your squad buddy]. Stay safe!”_ This would be a highly personalized mass communication, using the Skill Wheel data to give each member tailored advice even via one-to-many broadcasts.
    
- **External Certification Integration:** By now, we should integrate with external systems to automatically verify and credit certain achievements. For example, if a member goes out and earns an official EMT certification or an amateur radio license, the system could interface with that certifying body’s database or accept an upload of the certificate and then _automatically_ update the member’s First Aid or Comms segment. We’ll pursue partnerships or API integrations with major certification providers (Red Cross, FEMA training, HAM radio organizations, etc.) so that our members don’t have to enter things twice. This not only eases data entry but also enhances credibility (the system knows that a certification is legit because it was verified).
    
- **Careful Gamification (if any):** If we choose to introduce any gamified elements, Phase 3 is when it would happen, and only after a lot of thought and community input. Examples might be friendly competitions or challenges. For instance, we could have an annual “Chapter Preparedness Challenge” where squads collectively try to raise their average Skill Wheel percentage, or maybe issue digital badges for squads that achieve certain group milestones (like 100% of members above 50%). The emphasis would always be on _teamwork and improvement_, not individual bragging rights, in line with the [[Trust Doctrine]] (which cautions against vanity). Any competitive element would be opt-in and framed as a fun way to encourage training (for example, a region might host a “skills weekend” where everyone tries to boost their Navigation by 10%, etc.). The key is that we **never publicly single out individuals in a negative way** – success is celebrated collectively, and competition is used only to the extent that it motivates learning and practice.
    
- **Long-Term Evaluation and Evolution:** With several years of data and experience now, we will evaluate how the Skill Wheel correlates with real-world outcomes. Do members with higher Skill Wheels actually fare better in emergencies? Are there any skills we weighted too heavily or not enough? Perhaps we discover a new skill area that was not originally in the wheel but proves important. We will use this information to carefully evolve the system. For example, we might decide to add a new segment (if a major domain was missing) or adjust the internal weightings of certain skills. Any changes will be done with extreme care and transparency – likely we would archive old metrics so members can still see their historical progress even if we rescale something. The idea is to continuously improve the tool’s accuracy and usefulness over the long term.
    

Throughout all phases, **member communication and training about the system itself** remains crucial. We will likely create a dedicated “Skill Wheel Guidebook” or section in the SHTF Bible that clearly explains how the system works, how to interpret your profile, and how to use it to set personal goals. In Phase 1 this is delivered in-person (briefings, Q&A sessions). In Phases 2 and 3, we’ll supplement with in-app tutorials or videos for new features (for example, a quick tutorial when we introduce the new dashboard, or a guide on how to request a mentor through the app if that feature is added).

We will set **milestones and checkpoints** between phases. Notably, we will not advance to Phase 3 (full automation/AI) until we have verified that Phase 2’s data is solid and that our AI model – tested in pilot – is reliable and aligned with human judgment. According to our AI reliability plan, we’ll likely run the AI in parallel with human evaluation for a period, and only when the AI’s recommendations align well with what human experts would also suggest will we start deploying those AI suggestions to members directly. In other words, we will earn the membership’s confidence step by step, so that by the time the fancy AI stuff rolls out, members trust that it’s been vetted and is there to help, not to experiment on them.

## Integration with the Mk1Mod3 Ecosystem

The Skill Wheel system does not stand alone; it is one component of FPA’s larger **Mk1Mod3** architecture. (Mk1Mod3 refers to the current generation of FPA’s strategy and tools – see the [[Compass Guide]] for the master plan.) For context, Mk1Mod3 encompasses our mobile app, the compendium of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the _SHTF Bible_ knowledge base, the _Test My Plan_ tool, and the rank progression framework, among other things. We have designed the Skill Wheel to **complement and enhance each of these elements**:

- **FPA Mobile App:** The app is the primary user interface for members to interact with the Skill Wheel (especially starting in Phase 2). The profile section of the app will prominently feature the member’s Skill Wheel graphic and key stats. We’ll use app capabilities to support the system: for example, push notifications might remind a member to work on a weak area, the app’s camera can be used to scan or upload proof of real-world training (like taking a photo of a first aid certificate for verification), GPS might be used to trigger learning suggestions when traveling (e.g., “You’re in mountainous terrain this week – a good chance to practice Navigation skills!”). The app will also serve as the portal for **Adaptive Quizzes** (eventually tailoring question difficulty to the user’s level) and for delivering the AI’s recommendations directly to members. We’re mindful of keeping the UI uncluttered – likely the Skill Wheel view in the app will initially show the colored wheel and maybe an overall readiness score, with taps or swipes to drill down into details.
    
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** SOPs are the concrete “how-to” guides for various tasks and roles in FPA (for example, how to set up a field radio station, how to perform triage, etc.). We anticipate a two-way linkage between SOPs and the Skill Wheel. **First**, some Skill Wheel requirements will be directly tied to SOP completion. For instance, to reach 50% in Survivalcraft, you might need to demonstrate the SOP for emergency fire shelter deployment. In this way, the Skill Wheel actively encourages members to _practice SOPs_, not just read them. **Second**, the wheel can help identify members qualified for certain roles as defined by SOPs. For example, if there’s an SOP for “Squad Communications Officer,” we can map what skills are needed (say 70%+ in Comms, 50%+ in Navigation for setting up relays, etc.). Then, by looking at Skill Wheels, leaders can quickly see who meets those qualifications. During mission planning or emergency deployment, this is a quick reference: _“Who can handle medical triage right now? Let’s check wheels… Alice has 80% First Aid – she’s our best candidate.”_ In implementation, we will coordinate closely with the SOP development team so that the skill categories and metrics align naturally with SOP requirements.
    
- **SHTF Bible:** The _SHTF Bible_ is FPA’s extensive survival manual and knowledge base. Integration here is straightforward: the Skill Wheel points _to_ the content you should study, and the content can point _back_ to the Skill Wheel progress. We’ve already mentioned how each skill category corresponds to one or more chapters in the Bible. The Knowledge Management System maintains a mapping of wheel segments to those chapters or sections. In the app, if you notice a low score in a segment, there may be a “Learn” or “Study” button that jumps you to the relevant SHTF Bible material. Conversely, as you go through the digital SHTF Bible, you might encounter quizzes or “mark as completed” boxes that, when checked, feed into your Skill Wheel data. Another aspect is keeping them updated in tandem: as the SHTF Bible is updated over time (it’s a living document, updated with new best practices), we’ll update the Skill Wheel’s criteria accordingly. For example, if the SHTF Bible adds a new chapter on _cybersecurity preparedness_, we might add new objectives under the relevant category (or even add a new category if needed) so that members can get credit for learning that material. The end result is that the **knowledge base and the Skill Wheel stay synchronized** – one provides the information and the other measures the absorption of that information.
    
- **Test My Plan:** This tool evaluates members’ personal emergency plans via scenario simulation. We’ve described how it can feed into identifying skill gaps. To reiterate the synergy: the Skill Wheel encourages learning of individual skills; _Test My Plan_ checks how those skills are applied in a holistic plan. The integration ensures that planning (which is cross-functional by nature) influences training. If _Test My Plan_ finds, for example, that a member’s plan has no answer for “what if the main route is blocked?”, that hints at maybe a Navigation or planning skill gap – which the Skill Wheel can then highlight or direct them to fix. In the future, we might allow _Test My Plan_ results to directly unlock certain achievements on the Skill Wheel. Perhaps successfully passing a very comprehensive plan test gives a member a tag like “Plan-Validated” or contributes a bit to multiple segments (since a good plan implies effective integration of medical, comms, nav, etc.). This is somewhat experimental, but the key point is the tools will work in concert: _Test My Plan_ makes sure members not only have skills in isolation but can integrate them, and the Skill Wheel ensures they have the skills to begin with to make a solid plan.
    
- **Rank Progression System:** FPA likely has a rank or tier system for members (whether it’s military-style ranks or simply levels like Novice, Experienced, Leader, etc.). We plan to tie rank advancements partly to Skill Wheel progress. For example, to be promoted from “Recruit” to “Responder” you might need at least 40% in all core categories and one category above 60%. To reach a higher rank like “Senior Responder” or “Squad Leader,” you might need, say, 60%+ in all categories and an overall survivability score above 70%. The idea is that rank reflects not just time served or participation, but also _breadth of competence_. This prevents someone from gaming the system by only specializing in one thing to get promoted – we don’t want a “radio expert” who has 90% Comms but 10% in everything else to outrank others; they would need to round out their skills to be a leader. This use of the Skill Wheel to gate rank ensures **well-rounded development** is rewarded, which is crucial for leadership roles. We will formalize these rank requirements and communicate them clearly (e.g., a member can look at the next rank’s requirements and see which skills they need to bring up). It’s analogous to how in scouting or martial arts, advancement requires demonstrating proficiency across a range of areas, not just one specialty. Of course, we will be cautious to keep the spirit cooperative – the aim is personal growth, not rat-racing your peers. The Trust Doctrine’s guidance on humility and service will be observed: higher rank in FPA is about being more capable _for the benefit of the team_, not personal glory.
    

All these integrations will be documented in the Mk1Mod3 Master Plan (see the overall [[Compass Guide]]) to ensure everything stays coherent. From a member’s perspective, the goal is for the FPA ecosystem to feel like _one unified system_. For example: a member reads about a technique in the SHTF Bible, they then practice it in a _Test My Plan_ drill, that success updates their Skill Wheel, which in turn brings them closer to their next rank – and along each step, the app and materials are guiding them and reflecting their progress. It should feel seamless and supportive, with each component (content, practice, evaluation, recognition) reinforcing the others.

## Alignment with FPA Internal Doctrines and Plans

The design and implementation of the Skill Wheel system has been heavily guided by FPA’s internal principles and strategic documents. We want to ensure it aligns with the organization’s ethos and long-term strategy. Below we cross-reference key internal documents to illustrate that alignment:

- **SHTF Bible Design Document:** The design doc for the _SHTF Bible_ (our knowledge base) likely outlines how information is structured (possibly by scenario, by category, etc.), how it’s kept up-to-date, and how it’s meant to be used by members. Our Skill Wheel system is built to _leverage_ that content. By mapping skill categories directly to SHTF Bible chapters, we ensure that **training content and assessment criteria are in sync**. The Bible provides the “what you need to know,” and the Wheel tracks “what you have demonstrated knowing.” This means any changes in the SHTF Bible can be reflected in the Skill Wheel. If the Bible adds a new section on, say, _cybersecurity preparedness_, we can introduce a corresponding new skill element. Conversely, if we find through the Skill Wheel data that members consistently lack knowledge in an area, we can check if the Bible needs more content on that. In short, there’s a tight integration: the Skill Wheel is a practical extension of the SHTF Bible, turning the written knowledge into measurable competencies. This feedback loop will keep both the training content and the skill tracking relevant and up-to-date.
    
- **AI Reliability Plan:** FPA’s AI Reliability Plan (a set of guidelines for how we implement AI responsibly) has been a key reference for every AI-related feature in the Skill Wheel project. That plan likely emphasizes things like **explainability, human oversight, fail-safes, and data privacy**. We have baked those principles in throughout our design:
    
    - _Explainability:_ As noted, any AI-generated survivability score comes with an explanation of strengths and weaknesses, so members are never left mystified as to why the AI “thinks” something.
        
    - _Human Oversight:_ In Phases 2 and 3, AI recommendations are advisory and subject to instructor/mentor review. We are not letting the AI make high-stakes decisions (like promoting or excluding someone) without human confirmation. Early on especially, every AI action will be monitored by staff.
        
    - _Fail-Safes:_ If the AI system encounters an error or outputs something clearly off-base, the system will detect that (we can build in sanity checks – for instance if an output contradicts known data) and default to a safe state. A “safe state” might mean sticking with the last known good recommendation or deferring to a human. We will not allow an AI glitch to mislead our members or undermine trust. For example, if FPAi for some reason gave someone a bizarre 0% survivability warning (say due to a bug), we’d have checks to catch that and hold it for review rather than display it.
        
    - _Data Privacy:_ The AI features require using personal data (skills, location context, etc.) to generate tailored advice. We will strictly protect that data. The AI’s analysis of a member is only seen by that member and appropriate leaders – it’s not public. We will enforce encryption in storage and transmission. Even when sending data over Outernet, as mentioned, we plan to encrypt personal segments so only the intended device can read it. A member’s weaknesses or scores should _not_ fall into the wrong hands or become gossip. Internally, we treat Skill Wheel data with the same confidentiality as we would medical or personnel records. This is explicitly guided by the reliability and ethics plans governing our use of AI and data.
        
- **FPA Dictionary:** The [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]] is our authoritative source for terminology within the Alliance. As the Skill Wheel system introduces new terms and concepts (and repurposes some existing ones in specific ways), we will update the dictionary accordingly. For example, terms like “Skill Wheel,” “Preparedness Level,” “Survivability Score,” “FPAi,” “Outernet Sync,” etc., will have clear definitions in the dictionary. This ensures everyone speaks the same language. When a new member hears about the Skill Wheel or sees an acronym like FPAKM, they can refer to the dictionary and get a straightforward explanation. We are also aligning with the dictionary’s existing entries: if the dictionary defines certain skill levels or roles, we made sure to use the same wording and criteria. Consistent terminology across all training docs, the app, and leadership communications is important. Leaders might start using phrases like “Our squad’s average wheel is 55%, let’s focus on first aid and navigation to bring that up.” Thanks to the dictionary and training, all members will understand that jargon. Maintaining the dictionary entries will be an ongoing task especially as the system evolves – but it’s part of our change management process in Phase 2 and 3 to update documentation in lockstep with system updates.
    
- **Trust Doctrine:** Perhaps the most important guiding document is FPA’s [[Trust Doctrine]], which outlines how trust is maintained within the Alliance – trust among members, trust in leadership, and trust in our tools and processes. We have strived to design the Skill Wheel system in a way that _earns and preserves trust_. Some specific alignments:
    
    - _Transparency:_ The Trust Doctrine emphasizes transparency wherever possible. We avoid opaque “mystery metrics.” Members will know generally how their scores are computed (we might publish an outline of the scoring rubric). We’re also transparent about the unreachable 100% and why we chose that design – no hidden agendas. This openness prevents rumors or cynicism from taking root.
        
    - _No Vanity or False Incentives:_ The doctrine likely warns against creating systems that encourage checking boxes for the sake of appearances. We took that to heart – everything in the Skill Wheel must correspond to real capability. Our verification steps, the emphasis on drills and real demos, and the lack of trivial points all serve to avoid a hollow “point collection” dynamic. We will also actively audit and listen: if members find a way to game the system (e.g., someone figures out they can keep taking an easy quiz to inflate their score), we’ll adjust the system to close that loophole. The doctrine values **authenticity**, and so do we: a shiny Skill Wheel means nothing if the person can’t perform when it counts, so we’ve built in checks to always correlate the two.
        
    - _Teamwork Over Individual Glory:_ Trust in a team grows when everyone feels useful and no one is showboating at others’ expense. The Skill Wheel supports this by ensuring every member has at least a basic level in all areas (no one is utterly unskilled in any critical domain) and by highlighting that different people have different strengths. It’s implicitly saying: “We need each other to cover all the bases.” We’ve also avoided things like individual public leaderboards which could erode trust and camaraderie. Instead, any competitive aspect is team-based and supportive. This design was absolutely influenced by the Trust Doctrine’s guidance that we succeed or fail together.
        
    - _Accountability:_ The doctrine also means holding ourselves and our systems accountable. We intend to constantly validate that the Skill Wheel “walks the talk.” If the system says someone is 80% ready but in a drill they completely choke on a basic task, that’s on us to investigate why the system gave a misleading signal. We plan to set up **feedback loops** such as after-action reviews following real incidents or major drills. In those reviews, we’ll specifically compare outcomes to what the Skill Wheels had indicated. If we find discrepancies (and we expect to find some), we will openly address them and fix the system. For instance, if an after-action report shows that many members struggled with a task despite high scores, we might adjust the scoring or training for that task. Admitting mistakes and improving quickly is how we keep everyone’s trust.
        
    - _Gradual Introduction of AI:_ The Trust Doctrine likely advises not to impose technology without proving it. By phasing in the AI usage and always keeping a human hand on the wheel (no pun intended), we show respect for members’ trust. Those who are skeptical about an AI evaluating their survival chances will see that it’s implemented carefully, with oversight, and that it’s there to help – not to pass judgment or replace human advice. Over time, as it gives good advice, they’ll warm up to it. In line with the doctrine, we make it clear the AI is a tool _under our control_.
        

In summary, this Skill Wheel and FPAKM system isn’t being built in isolation. It stands on the shoulders of these internal policies and plans. We treat those documents as requirements just as important as the user-facing features. At every design meeting, we ask questions like: _Does this foster trust? Is this terminology consistent? Are we reinforcing our core doctrine values?_ By continuously checking our decisions against the SHTF Bible’s guidance, the AI reliability rules, the Dictionary definitions, and the Trust Doctrine’s principles, we aim to ensure the system remains in harmony with FPA’s identity and mission.

## Inspirations from Similar Systems in Other Fields

While the FPA Skill Wheel is tailored to emergency preparedness, we drew inspiration and lessons from analogous systems in other domains – the military, healthcare, education, and various elite training programs. These parallels helped shape a robust and credible system, and also warned us of pitfalls to avoid:

- **Military Readiness and Cross-Training:** Military organizations track the readiness of their personnel across multiple skill domains (physical fitness, marksmanship, medical training, technical skills, etc.). In elite units, every operator has a primary specialty but is _cross-trained_ in the fundamentals of the others’ specialties, to ensure no critical skill gap on a team. For instance, a U.S. Army Special Forces team (ODA) has designated weapons experts, medics, engineers, communicators, etc., but each member is expected to know at least basic skills in all those areas – so if the medic is down, someone else can perform essential aid. This directly influenced our “no 0%” policy – we want every FPA member to have some capability in each area, just like an ODA member can handle themselves even outside their specialty. The military also provides models for how to reward proficiency (they issue marksmanship badges, for example, at different levels) and enforce ongoing qualification (annual requalification on weapons or fitness tests). We borrowed from that by planning periodic re-tests and by potentially using small icons for milestones on the wheel. On the flip side, the military can sometimes fall into a “checklist” mentality, where people chase qualifications for promotion points rather than truly internalizing skills. We are very conscious of that pitfall – our system focuses heavily on practical demonstration and verification, not just accumulating certificates. Also, the way militaries summarize unit readiness (like the US Army’s color-coded C-level ratings for units) shows it is possible to communicate a complex readiness state simply, but it must be done carefully to be truthful. Our approach to an overall survivability score with detailed breakdowns is analogous – a simple summary backed by nuanced detail.
    
- **Healthcare Competency Frameworks:** In healthcare, professionals maintain competencies across multiple domains (clinical skills, communication, critical thinking, etc.), and hospitals use tracking systems to ensure each staff member is up-to-date on required skills (e.g., CPR certifications, medication administration competencies). A key lesson from healthcare is the premium on **accuracy** – lives depend on it. You do _not_ want an incompetent surgeon falsely certified as competent, nor do you want to bar a talented nurse from doing a procedure just because a box wasn’t checked. To address this, healthcare competency systems combine written tests with direct supervisor observation and mentoring. We mirrored that approach by mixing quizzes, drills, and real-world checks in our inputs. Another aspect is continuous development: doctors and nurses have ongoing education requirements (CMEs, etc.) and multi-tier competency frameworks. For example, the NAHQ Healthcare Quality Competency Framework defines 8 domains of competency with 3 levels of proficiency, and professionals self-assess or are assessed to identify gaps. We found this multi-domain, leveled approach very relevant – it reinforced our design of discrete skill categories with progressive levels (our 10%-increment visual scale roughly maps to novice → intermediate → advanced expertise). Healthcare also warns against **credential inflation** – collecting certificates that don’t translate to real skill. That’s why our system gives more weight to drills and actual demonstrations. Much like a hospital might run a simulation to ensure a nurse who took an online course can actually perform CPR on a dummy, we emphasize proving ability, not just possessing a card.
    
- **Elite Certification Paths:** Consider programs like becoming a certified emergency manager, a master SCUBA diver, or a black belt in martial arts. These programs require **mastery of a breadth of sub-skills through staged progression**. For example, to achieve Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts’ highest rank), one must earn a variety of merit badges across diverse categories: first aid, citizenship, fitness, outdoorsmanship, etc. This ensures a well-rounded skill set – directly paralleling our requirement that FPA members develop all core areas, not just one. In our context, you can liken each Skill Wheel segment to a “merit badge category,” except we allow partial progress (you don’t either have it or not – you can be 40% toward completing a certain set of skills). Another example: **SCUBA diving certifications (PADI)**. As a diver, you start as Open Water certified, then perhaps Advanced Open Water (which requires navigation dives, deep dives among others), then Rescue Diver (adding rescue and first aid skills), and eventually Master Scuba Diver which requires experience in many different conditions (night dive, search and recovery dive, etc.). By the time someone is a Master Diver, they’ve accumulated a broad range of experiences. The lesson we take is the value of **progressive training with expanding scope**. That’s why we built the phase progression and tie-ins to rank: as members advance, we expect a broader set of experiences. Also, elite communities instill the mindset that _you’re never truly done_. Martial arts masters often say “a black belt means you’re a serious student, not that you’ve learned everything.” We mirror that ethos: reaching an elite level in FPA (say a very high Skill Wheel and rank) is framed as the start of a new level of responsibility (teaching others, refining subtler skills), not an endpoint.
    
- **Professional Skill Self-Assessments (Corporate “Radar” Charts):** In some industries and corporate training settings, individuals use tools like _radar charts_ or _skill wheels_ to self-assess their proficiency in various competencies (for example, a software engineer might rate themselves in algorithms, system design, communication, teamwork, etc.). These often look very similar to our wheel concept. Typically, these are used for personal development discussions – you visually see that, say, one dimension is much lower than others and make a plan to improve it. One insight from these tools is that the **visual unevenness** is itself a motivator; people naturally want to “fill out” a lopsided shape. We absolutely are leveraging that psychology. When a member sees their wheel has one or two glaring dents, most will be driven to work on those. However, another caution from these systems is that self-assessment can be unreliable – many people overestimate or underestimate their skills. That’s why our percentages are _not_ self-assigned; they are earned through objective measures. We ensure data accuracy via tests and verifications, rather than someone just rating themselves. In other words, we took the best part of those radar charts (the visualization of imbalance) and avoided the worst part (inaccurate self-reporting) by building a more objective backend.
    
- **Gamification in Fitness and Learning Apps:** We looked at popular apps and games (like Duolingo for language learning, various fitness tracker apps, etc.) to learn what to do – and _what not to do_. A common pitfall is when **the metric becomes the goal**, rather than the real-world outcome it’s supposed to represent. For example, someone might focus on earning points or maintaining a streak even if they aren’t truly improving their skills. Expert commentary on gamification stresses focusing on meaningful progress and avoiding “shiny badge” distractions ([How to Avoid Common Gamification Measurement Mistakes](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-some-common-pitfalls-mistakes-avoid-when-measuring#:~:text=When%20setting%20goals%2C%20it%27s%20crucial,periodically%20to%20ensure%20they%20stay)). We took this to heart. Every design choice in our system – from giving everyone a 10% start, to how points are awarded, to how we communicate what the scores mean – is intended to reflect _real preparedness_, not arbitrary gamification. For instance, one article advised to “avoid vanity metrics that sound impressive but don’t actually move the needle” and to periodically review goals to ensure they remain relevant. We adopted that philosophy by, for example, capping quiz-only progress and emphasizing drills – making sure that what goes up on the wheel truly represents improved survival chances (i.e., _moving the needle_ in readiness). We also plan to regularly re-evaluate our scoring model to ensure it correlates with actual performance and outcomes (which ties back to the accountability feedback loop).
    

In summary, these external analogues provided both **validation and warnings** for our project. They validated that tracking multi-faceted competency is a proven approach in high-stakes fields – militaries do it, hospitals do it, etc. – and that a well-rounded readiness profile is achievable and desirable. They also reinforced key design elements: no critical zeroes (military cross-training), mix knowledge with demonstration (healthcare), structured progression (scouting/SCUBA/martial arts), and smart use of visualization and motivation (corporate radar charts, gamified apps). At the same time, they warned us of the dangers of box-checking, vanity metrics, and false senses of accomplishment. By internalizing those lessons, we’ve built the FPA Skill Wheel to be **grounded in reality and truly beneficial** for preparing our members, rather than being just an app gimmick.

## Avoiding Vanity Metrics and “Badge-Chasing”

A significant concern in deploying a system like this is the temptation for members to chase numbers and badges for their own sake, losing sight of the actual mission (being prepared to help themselves and others in emergencies). We have implemented several design and cultural measures to avoid the trap of **vanity metrics**:

- **Meaningful Metrics Only:** Every data point in the Skill Wheel is tied to a real skill or accomplishment. We deliberately chose not to award frivolous points. For example, you don’t get 1% just for logging into the app, or a badge for posting on a forum. If it’s on your wheel, it has a real preparedness value. This reduces the risk of members finding loopholes to boost their score without actually improving capability. We will also conduct periodic audits of high scores to ensure they were earned through a diverse set of _relevant_ activities. If someone somehow has a very high score purely from taking easy quizzes, for instance, that will be flagged for review.
    
- **Balanced Scoring Algorithm:** We’ve balanced the contributions of different activity types (quizzes vs. drills vs. real experiences) to reward substance over form. In theory, someone could try to game the system by memorizing quiz answers and racking up quiz points. But we cap how far quizzes alone can take you – beyond a certain percentage, you _must_ do drills and demonstrate skills in action. High-level proficiency in any segment requires an instructor’s sign-off or real-world proof. This inherently prevents “paper tigers” – a member who only has book knowledge will hit a ceiling on their wheel until they get out and practice. By Phase 3, FPAi will even help detect anomalies: e.g., if someone aces all the advanced comms quizzes but then performs poorly on a basic radio operation drill, the system (or an instructor) will flag that discrepancy for follow-up. The effect is that to have a high score, you almost certainly have the real ability to match, because the easy stuff only gets you so far.
    
- **No Public Individual Leaderboards:** We consciously avoid any feature that would pit members against each other in a race for points. There will be _no_ “Top 10 Preppers” scoreboard or public ranking of members by their Skill Wheel scores. Competition, if introduced, will be on a group level and purely for fun/cohesion (for example, a friendly inter-squad challenge as mentioned earlier, where squads try to improve together). We do not want a culture of “Bob is rank #1, Alice is #2, Charlie is way down at #50.” Everyone’s context and journey are different. A 40% wheel for a newcomer who has learned a lot in one month is more laudable (and useful to the group) than a 60% wheel for someone who’s been stagnant for a year. Therefore, we focus on **personal progress tracking** (you versus your past self) and team readiness metrics, rather than individual rankings. Removing public individual rankings takes away the incentive to treat the Skill Wheel like a video game high-score chart.
    
- **Cultural Messaging:** We are shaping the narrative from the top down that **the mission is saving lives, not collecting badges.** Whenever leadership talks about the Skill Wheel, we frame it in terms of real-world impact. Any time we recognize a member’s achievement, we tie it to how it improves our collective readiness. For example, rather than saying “Congrats on reaching 70% in Navigation!” we might say “Thanks to all that map work, John is now able to confidently guide others during an evacuation – a huge asset to our team.” This constant linking of skills to their practical purpose helps members internalize that the _skill itself_ (and its application) is the reward, not the number. The Trust Doctrine supports this approach by valuing authenticity and cautioning against self-aggrandizement. We will also prepare mentors and leaders to gently correct any signs of unhealthy competition or bragging. For instance, if someone starts boasting about their score, a leader might remind them (perhaps with humor) that “there’s always more to learn” and maybe point out an area they could help others in instead.
    
- **Unachievable Perfection:** The decision that 100% is unreachable is in part to prevent the “game over, I won” mentality. In many games or gamified systems, once people hit the max level or collect all badges, they lose interest or get overly proud. By always leaving room for improvement, even top performers stay engaged and humble. It also encourages knowledge-sharing: if someone has an impressively filled-out wheel, one of the only ways for them to keep growing is to **mentor others** (teaching is a great way to deepen one’s own understanding). We’ll encourage this – essentially saying, “If your wheel is nearly full, your new goal is to help someone else fill theirs.” It transforms high achievers from being end-of-line “winners” into valuable coaches and force-multipliers.
    
- **Mentorship and Collaborative Learning:** As alluded to, we want high-skill members to gain status by _lifting others up_, not just by showing off their own skills. We may formalize this by incorporating mentorship into our advancement criteria. For example, to reach the highest rank in FPA, part of the requirement could be “mentored at least 2 other members through to intermediate proficiency.” This way, those with near-complete wheels channel their energy into teaching, which benefits the whole community and also keeps the focus on collective readiness. It shifts the bragging rights dynamic into something healthier: your brag is not “I have 90% in everything,” but rather “our squad increased its average by 15% this year, partly thanks to my coaching.” That’s a boast that actually aligns with our values.
    
- **Continuous Review of Metrics:** We will continuously scrutinize the system itself. The question we’ll keep asking is, “Is this metric or feature driving real preparedness, or has it become hollow?” If we ever identify an aspect of the system that isn’t contributing to our mission, we will change or remove it. For instance, if we had introduced a badge for “30-day login streak” (just a hypothetical example) and found that people were just opening the app daily to keep the streak alive without engaging in training, we’d eliminate that badge. The idea is to ensure all incentives remain meaningful. This approach echoes best practices in gamified systems where designers periodically adjust the program to prevent counterproductive habits. Our measurement of success isn’t high scores themselves, but correlations with actual resilience and performance. So the metrics must evolve if they stop reflecting that.
    
- **Qualitative Feedback Integration:** We recognize that not everything important can be quantified on a wheel. Traits like leadership, teamwork, creativity under pressure, calmness in chaos – these are critical in emergencies but are hard to reduce to a percentage. To ensure such qualities are not overlooked, we will allow **qualitative notes** and feedback in member profiles. For example, after a major drill, a squad leader might add a note to a member’s profile: “Demonstrated exceptional teamwork and problem-solving during the March exercise.” These notes don’t affect the Skill Wheel scores, but they show up for leaders and the member themselves. It paints a fuller picture of the member’s readiness beyond numbers. It also signals that FPA values more than what can be scored. This helps discourage members from obsessing solely on the numbers; they know that being a good team player or an inspiring leader is recognized in other ways.
    
- **Avoiding Over-Gamification:** We have been very careful not to turn the Skill Wheel system into a trivial game. Yes, we use game-like visualization and progression, but we stop short of things that could cheapen the seriousness of our mission. For instance, we are not implementing virtual currencies, pointless collectibles, or gimmicky rewards like “buy new avatar clothes with points” – those have no place in a survival preparedness context and would distract from the mission. The _reward_ for leveling up your Skill Wheel is **real competence and the ability to handle crises**, and maybe increased respect and responsibility in the community – not virtual trinkets. This keeps the tone aligned with FPA’s no-nonsense mission. We can certainly have fun during training (friendly competition, badges as mementos, etc.), but everyone knows it’s in service of real-world goals.
    

In essence, we strive for what one might call **“authentic gamification”** – using a few game design elements (visual feedback, levels, achievable challenges) purely to drive genuine engagement and skill-building, _never_ to create a false sense of accomplishment. If we ever detect vanity or gaming of the system creeping in, we will recalibrate the system to refocus on reality. Both FPA leadership and the member community will hold each other accountable to keep the Skill Wheel honest and useful.

Our hope is that as members use the system, they will see the translation of their Skill Wheel improvements into actual field performance. For example, a member might realize, “I handled that emergency so much better than I would have a year ago – and that’s because I followed the learning path to improve my medical and comms skills.” When members connect those dots, they internalize that _the real value lies in the skills_, not the numbers. At that point, the Skill Wheel simply becomes a mirror reflecting their progress and a map pointing to what to do next. It’s not the _object_ of the game, but a guiding tool for the never-ending journey of preparedness. And that is exactly what we want in FPA: a culture where we are always learning and adapting, never for bragging rights, always for the true goal – protecting ourselves and our community.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

No plan is complete without analyzing potential risks and how we will mitigate them. The Skill Wheel and FPAKM system, while promising, comes with certain risks that we have anticipated and prepared for:

1. **Data Accuracy and Truthfulness:** If the data feeding the Skill Wheel is inaccurate – say a member’s skills are overestimated or underreported – then the wheel’s output (and any AI analysis) will be flawed and potentially dangerous. **Mitigations:** We rely on verified inputs at every critical juncture. Early on, that means instructor sign-offs and documentation checks. For ongoing use, it means requiring multiple sources of evidence for significant skill claims (for example, you only get marked “proficient” if you’ve passed the quiz _and_ the drill). We’ll also enforce periodic re-tests and drills; skills can atrophy, so an annual or semiannual check-in will recalibrate the wheel if needed. If someone somehow “gamed” a quiz (e.g. cheated or memorized answers without learning), that should become apparent during the practical drill – at which point instructors can correct the record. Additionally, we will use cross-validation – if the AI or system notices inconsistencies (like a member with very high quiz scores but very low instructor evaluations on drills), it will flag that for human review. Our motto here is **“trust, but verify”** – trust what members input or claim, but have verification steps at multiple levels.
    
2. **Over-Reliance on AI Predictions:** There’s a risk that members or leaders might put too much stock in the AI-generated survivability scores or recommendations, treating them as gospel. If the AI is wrong or if it fails to consider a factor, this could mislead preparation efforts. Conversely, a pessimistic AI assessment might demoralize someone unduly. **Mitigations:** We will constantly remind users that the AI is a **decision support tool, not a decision maker**. All AI-provided scores will come with caveats that they are estimates. We will encourage common-sense and personal judgment to override the AI when members have extra information. For example, if the AI says “you’re fine,” but the member knows they have a medical condition or personal circumstance the AI didn’t account for, they should trust themselves and even input that info into the system for better analysis. We’ll refine the AI continuously with real-world feedback (machine learning models will be retrained as we get more outcome data). And importantly, we will never frame the survivability score as a guarantee. It’s always “likelihood” or “projection.” All messaging around it will reinforce that it’s an aid to highlight strengths and weaknesses, not a crystal ball.
    
3. **Privacy and Security of Member Data:** The Skill Wheel system will hold sensitive personal information – essentially a profile of strengths and weaknesses. In the wrong hands, that information could be misused. For instance, if someone hostile obtained a list of who has low security skills, they might target those people. **Mitigations:** We treat this data as we would medical or personnel records, with strict confidentiality. Technically, we will implement strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Access to the data is role-based: members see only their own data; squad leaders might see a summary of their squad (with consent); higher aggregates are anonymized. When we broadcast or sync data offline, personal details will be encrypted or coded so only the intended recipient’s device can read it. We’ll also educate members on OPSEC – for example, discouraging them from publicly sharing their scores or posting their Skill Wheel on social media, since that could reveal personal info. In terms of cybersecurity, the system will be part of FPA’s critical infrastructure, so it will undergo regular security audits, penetration testing, and have backups. Essentially, we apply the same rigor to this as we do to protecting member lists or other sensitive comms.
    
4. **Technical Reliability (Offline/Online Sync):** The utility of the system in a crisis depends on it being accessible offline. If our sync mechanisms fail, or if a disaster strikes before the latest data was transmitted, members might be looking at outdated info. **Mitigations:** Redundancy and tolerance for staleness are key. We design the offline materials (binder printouts, etc.) to be useful even without frequent updates – they focus on fundamental principles that don’t change rapidly (first aid steps, contact lists) more than ephemeral data. If a member’s printed wheel isn’t updated for a few months, that’s usually fine; their core skills likely haven’t radically changed, and having something is better than nothing. We will thoroughly test the Outernet and other sync channels during calm periods (e.g., incorporate it into drills: simulate the internet down and practice using only our radio/Outernet updates). We also maintain backup comms methods: if the satellite fails, maybe we switch to HF radio broadcasts of critical info, or even a phone tree to disseminate urgent messages. And we encourage each member to _also_ keep their own analog notes of training (like a simple log in their binder) just in case – an “offline-first” habit where high-tech augments but does not replace low-tech preparedness.
    
5. **Member Psychology – Complacency or Discouragement:** This we have discussed in detail earlier, but to restate in risk terms: A high-scoring member might become complacent (“I’m all set, I don’t need to train anymore”), or a low-scoring member might feel overwhelmed and give up (“I’ll never get better, why bother”). **Mitigations:** We address complacency by the design (no one ever reaches 100%, criteria can evolve, AI keeps challenging you with harder scenarios). We address discouragement by the 10% baseline, quick initial progression, and mentorship to support newbies. Additionally, we will **not** use the Skill Wheel punitively. For example, we won’t say “you cannot participate in this mission because your wheel is below X%,” except perhaps for highly specialized dangerous roles (and even then it would be handled case-by-case). Instead, we practice pairing – if someone is weaker, we put them under the wing of a stronger member during missions. This way lower-skilled members still get to participate and learn, rather than being sidelined (which would be demotivating). As for complacency among veterans, the FPA culture of continuous improvement, plus the slight skill decay for non-use, plus social pressure (seeing others learning new things) should keep even the “old hands” on their toes. If needed, we might implement a gentle decay as mentioned (like losing a few points if you haven’t practiced a skill in a long time, which serves as a nudge to refresh it). All these measures together create an environment where the wheel is seen as a helpful guide, not a label that limits people.
    
6. **Gaming the System or Vanity Behavior:** Despite our precautions, some individuals might attempt to cheat (for example, by finding answer keys to quizzes, or falsely claiming they did a drill) or start caring more about their score than the mission. **Mitigations:** We’ve made cheating on quizzes harder by having large question banks and randomizing questions. Many of our quizzes might even be open-book – which sounds counterintuitive, but in real life the ability to quickly find and apply information is as valuable as memorizing it. If it’s open-book, “cheating” by looking up answers is actually just learning. For hands-on claims, that’s where verification comes in. FPA has a strong community aspect; typically, if someone claims they completed a certain training, there will be a record or witnesses. The **honor code** within FPA (part of the Trust Doctrine ethos) will also be emphasized: lying about your preparedness is a serious breach of trust because it could endanger lives. Culturally, anyone caught faking things will face social consequences and possibly be reset in the system (we might revoke unearned points). As for vanity, by removing public ranks and fostering team play, we minimize avenues for grandstanding. If someone tries to flaunt their wheel, usually their peers or leaders will gently put it in context (“Great, you have 80% – maybe you can help the team by teaching a class, instead of boasting.”). We will highlight stories in our newsletters or meetings where, say, a low-ranked member’s quick thinking saved the day, to show that numbers aren’t everything – character and cool under pressure matter too.
    
7. **Scope Creep and Complexity:** As we add more features (especially by Phase 3), there’s a risk the system becomes too complicated to use or maintain. If members see it as a bureaucratic chore or something overwhelmingly complex, it could backfire and reduce engagement. **Mitigations:** We will adhere to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles in the user experience. For the average member, interacting with the Skill Wheel should feel straightforward: _learn skills → log/validate them → see your wheel grow_. They shouldn’t need to know about all the weights, algorithms, or data flows under the hood (those can live in documentation for those interested). Each phase’s rollout will come with training and clear comms so that new features aren’t a surprise. On the backend, we’ll be cautious about feature bloat – every addition must have a clear value. If a particular data point isn’t proving useful, we might stop tracking it. By Phase 3, we expect to possibly have dedicated support (maybe an admin team or even an AI assistant) to help manage the system. For example, if manually reviewing anomalies becomes too much, an AI script might automatically do first-pass checks. We’ll also modularize the system so that if one part fails or is too much, it can be revised without taking everything down.
    
8. **Member Acceptance and Cultural Fit:** Change is hard. Some members (especially those with a lot of real-world experience) might initially resist the Skill Wheel. They might say “I don’t need an app to tell me what I know” or distrust the idea of quantifying survival skills. **Mitigations:** We will emphasize that this is a tool _for_ members, created to help them identify where to focus and to showcase what they’ve accomplished. We’ll involve members in the design process (e.g., the Phase 1 pilot will solicit their feedback heavily). If a veteran member is skeptical, we might ask them to help test and improve it – turning a critic into a collaborator. Participation in the system will be strongly encouraged but we won’t immediately expel someone who opts out; we suspect peer pressure and obvious benefits will bring them around. For example, if all their squad mates have these cool personal readiness dashboards and are getting targeted tips and they’re the only one not using it, they might eventually join in when they see others gaining value. We’ll make sure the system _does_ provide clear value: e.g., the AI suggestions actually help people, the wheel makes it easier to plan team missions, etc. As those success stories circulate (“Hey, the AI recommended I take that course and it was great!”), holdouts will see the benefit. All along, aligning with the Trust Doctrine (e.g., not using this data against members, being transparent, etc.) will help convince folks that this isn’t Big Brother or a trivial toy – it’s a genuine aid.
    
9. **“Vanity Progress” vs. Real Preparedness (Strategic Risk):** This is a broader organizational risk: leadership might inadvertently start focusing on Skill Wheel metrics (like average scores) as a goal in themselves, rather than what those metrics stand for (members actually being prepared). For instance, a danger would be if HQ says “We need to get our average skill level to 60% by next year” and people start chasing that number without truly learning. **Mitigations:** Leadership will be coached to always pair metrics with qualitative and outcome-based indicators. In leadership meetings, when reviewing something like “X% of members are above 50%,” that should be immediately correlated with real-world readiness checks (like “Did those chapters actually perform well in drills?”). If there’s a mismatch, that’s a red flag that we address. We will include qualitative KPIs in our evaluations of readiness – e.g., number of successful missions, community members aided during disasters, etc. Those are the true success measures. The Skill Wheel helps drive those, but it’s not the end goal. By keeping that perspective (metrics as means, not ends), and possibly formalizing it in policy, we guard against chasing numbers. Essentially, we’ll use the data as a tool to ask the right questions and find weak spots, not as the sole determinant of success.
    

By identifying these risks early, we have incorporated features and policies to mitigate them from the start. We will remain vigilant as the system rolls out. The Skill Wheel system will undergo **continuous improvement not just in features but in safety and ethics**. We plan to establish a review board or committee (including folks from the AI team, training instructors, and member representatives) that meets periodically to review how the system is affecting the membership and to address any new issues that arise. This governance component will ensure we stay true to FPA’s values and mission. Our ultimate aim is for the Skill Wheel and Knowledge Management system to be a strong asset to FPA – something that enhances our preparedness and unity – and never a liability or source of division.

## Conclusion

The Fair Preparation Alliance **Skill Wheel and Knowledge Management System** is an ambitious initiative that integrates **visual tracking, personalized training, and AI-driven insights** into the fabric of FPA’s operations. By breaking down the vast concept of “being prepared” into tangible skill categories and measurable progress, it empowers members to take charge of their own development and see how each effort they make directly builds their resilience.

The design – with its colorful wheel graphic, clear percentages, and the member’s personal call sign at the center – reinforces that **preparedness is personal**, yet also part of a larger team effort. Each member’s strengths contribute to the Alliance’s overall strength, and each gap identified is an opportunity for the group to support that member or for that member to improve. In other words, when a member looks at their Skill Wheel, they’re not just seeing _their_ readiness, but also how they plug into the broader preparedness network of FPA.

This strategic plan has detailed how the system will function and grow through **three phases**: starting from simple, human-verified assessments in Phase 1, advancing through digital integration in Phase 2, and eventually reaching smart automation and widespread adoption in Phase 3. At each step, we have been careful to ground the plan in FPA’s core values and existing doctrines. Technology serves our people – never the other way around. We would rather have a low-tech solution that members trust and use, than a fancy high-tech system that alienates or confuses. Fortunately, by following our phased approach, we can have the best of both: introduce the concepts in low-tech ways to build trust, then add tech muscle once the concept is proven and embraced.

When fully realized, the Skill Wheel will act as a **unifying interface** across FPA’s toolkit – linking the training content of the _SHTF Bible_, the procedural knowledge of SOPs, the experiential learning from drills (and _Test My Plan_ simulations), and the forward-looking analysis of our AI. It essentially closes the loop between _learning_ and _doing_. What a member learns in training gets recorded on the wheel; that record then guides them on what to learn next; and around it goes in a continuous cycle of improvement. This cycle is essential for a “living” preparedness organization like FPA. We can’t afford stagnation; the world is always changing, and we need to be continually learning. The Skill Wheel system institutionalizes that mindset.

Crucially, we have engineered this system to avoid the common pitfalls of metric-driven programs by keeping the focus on **real-world readiness and humility**. In FPA, a high score on your Skill Wheel is not a badge to show off – it’s a responsibility. It means you are in a position to lead, to teach, to help others with those skills. A low score is not a failure; it’s the _beginning_ of a journey that every one of our seasoned members has gone through. The culture around the Skill Wheel will be one of **support and teamwork**: members will help each other fill their gaps, celebrate genuine skill acquisition, and always remember that no single person can do it all – that’s why we operate as an Alliance.

In providing this detailed plan, we’ve created a blueprint to build the system in alignment with FPA’s Mk1Mod3 program and ethical framework. The next steps after this plan would be to develop prototypes (both of the visual aspects and the database/app backend), test them with a pilot group, and gather feedback for refinement. From there, we implement Phase 1 officially, then Phase 2, and so on, with continuous improvements at each stage.

With diligent implementation and adherence to our principles, the FPA Skill Wheel will become more than just a visual dashboard – it will be a **compass** that points each member toward greater preparedness. It will transform abstract goals (like “be better prepared”) into visible, trackable progress, making the formidable task of disaster readiness feel tangible and achievable. Yet it will also constantly remind us that it’s a journey without end – there is no 100%, no finish line, only continual improvement. In a world of growing uncertainties, this system will help ensure that FPA members stay **ready, realistic, and resilient**, learning and adapting together, no matter what challenges lie ahead.
