- **Integration with Authorities:** FPA’s liaison (a Level 4 coordinator) is monitoring the city’s emergency channel. The city knows of our presence. They request any on-ground intel from neighborhoods their crews can’t reach. FPA hams relay key observations: where fires are, where streets are blocked by trees, etc. This helps prioritize official response when the worst winds subside. We’re effectively acting as an extension of the response network, all unofficial but very real.
