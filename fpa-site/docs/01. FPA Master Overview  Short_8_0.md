1. **Breadth vs. brevity:** 1‑page index hides nuance; link sanity check passed.  
2. **Pending short‑view for Readiness & Drills** flagged.  
3. **Glossary limited to 10 anchors** to fit one screen; extend in next rev if needed.  
4. **Funding numbers** match full doc; re‑verify after next finance audit.
