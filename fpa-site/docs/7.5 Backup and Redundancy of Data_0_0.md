Disasters that take out infrastructure shouldn’t erase FPA’s knowledge. Thus, the Alliance implements robust backup and redundancy strategies for all critical data. The Knowledge Vault, for example, isn’t kept in just one place: multiple members maintain offline copies (on laptops, external hard drives, even USB flash drives sealed against water). Some caches include a Raspberry Pi or small server with the vault data that can spin up a local Wi-Fi hotspot serving the info to anyone nearby. Regularly, a designated “Archivist” member will prompt everyone to update their copies – or distribute fresh ones at meetups – so that recent changes propagate. Important documents (like contact lists, emergency plans, legal papers) are printed and stored in waterproof folders at secure locations (maybe in each chapter’s emergency cache, or handed to trusted members). They also use media diversity: not relying solely on electronic formats, FPA might microfilm some key documents or use M-Disc DVDs (which are very long-lasting) for an archive that can be read decades later. Passwords or encryption keys for sensitive data are themselves backed up, but in a secure manner (split across several people’s knowledge so no single person has the full key unless absolutely needed, sometimes called Shamir’s Secret Sharing). The Alliance tests its backups – e.g., during a drill, simulate that the main coordinator’s laptop is destroyed and see if another member can bring up the vault from their backup
