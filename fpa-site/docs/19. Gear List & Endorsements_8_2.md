- **Local Drills and Training with Endorsed Gear:** A piece of gear is only as good as the user’s ability to wield it under stress. FPA’s doctrine emphasizes **hands-on training** as part of the endorsement value. Local squads regularly organize drills and practice sessions where members bring their endorsed gear and simulate scenarios (many drawn from our _SHTF Bible_). For instance, a squad might have a “water purification day” where everyone uses their FPA-endorsed filters to purify local pond water, or a night navigation drill using endorsed flashlights and maps. These drills serve a dual purpose: they reinforce the reliability of the gear (or reveal issues, which get fed back into our monitoring process) and they ensure members know how to use the tools when it counts. Results and experiences from drills are logged in the Gear Audit Journals and shared at squad meetings. This continuous offline engagement keeps knowledge fresh and uncovers any “user experience” issues with gear that pure testing might miss (e.g., a device that technically works but is too complicated to operate under pressure, which might prompt us to add that note to its profile or even reconsider the endorsement).
