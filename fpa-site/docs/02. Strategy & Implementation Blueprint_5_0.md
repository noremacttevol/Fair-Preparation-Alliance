The next layer is our **process**: the shared knowledge, practices, and training that align all squads. The FPA **Compass Guide** is our central reference manual and ethical compass, containing codes of conduct, detailed SOPs, and guidelines for various scenarios. It ensures that different squads and members operate with a **common understanding**. Key aspects include:  
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** For every routine operation or likely scenario, we maintain an SOP in the Compass Guide. SOPs cover things like how to conduct a squad check-in, how to handle an equipment vetting drill, how to respond to a local emergency, communication protocols, etc. They are written clearly and updated as we learn. By following SOPs, squads minimize mistakes and variability â€“ everyone is on the same page, literally.  
- **Training Programs:** The Compass Guide also outlines training modules. This includes basic onboarding training, specialized skills (first aid, navigation, cybersecurity, etc.), and leadership training. Many of these are delivered through the FPA App (e.g. interactive lessons) but can be done offline via downloadable materials. Completion of training modules often corresponds to progression milestones for members.
