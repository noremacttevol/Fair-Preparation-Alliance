In short, Section 16 isn’t an island – it’s the communication of all our doctrines put into practice. It takes the **values** from Trust, the **self-sufficiency** from Offline-First, the **tools** from Gear, and the **leadership framework** from Compass, and fuses them into a working manual for staying connected and organized when everything else falls apart. Members should continually cross-reference these sources: if a question of “_why_ are we doing this in comms?” arises, the answer likely lies in the Trust or Compass documents (e.g., we encrypt not because we’re paranoid but because we value trust and security of info; we share certain info publicly because Compass says to help the wider community, etc.). Conversely, the success of those doctrines depends on comms: you can’t build trust if you can’t communicate; you can’t follow a compass if you can’t receive guidance.  
Thus, this Communications Readiness Doctrine is effectively the **central nervous system** connecting the Alliance’s body of doctrine. It carries the signals of our values and plans to every member, ensuring that planning translates into coordinated execution.
