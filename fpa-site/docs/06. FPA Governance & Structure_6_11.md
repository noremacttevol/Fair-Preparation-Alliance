- **Emergency & Ethical “Trust Firewall” in Practice:** _(This example shows how multiple protocols interlock in a crisis)_ Imagine a scenario where an unverified individual shows up on our radio frequency claiming to be an authority and giving orders to FPA teams during a regional crisis. Our Trust Firewall would prompt us to verify their identity through challenge questions or by confirming with known officials – we don’t just obey because someone uses a plausible callsign. At the same time, our Compass Guide ethics would remind teams to coordinate with legitimate emergency services, but _on our terms of trust_. We might dispatch a squad to physically confirm that person’s credentials. During this, our offline comms plan ensures that even if that voice tried to jam or mislead our coordination, squads have pre-planned rendezvous and code words to continue operating. If the person turned out legit, great – we’d integrate with them; if not, our firewall and protocols would have stopped a potential misdirection. This example shows how the layers work together: trust but verify; use tech but always have a manual backup; and lean on our training and ethics no matter what.
