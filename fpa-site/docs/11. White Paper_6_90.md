- Update documents: this Phase 2 development plan can be living. Donâ€™t be afraid to add a Milestone 51 or modify an existing one if circumstances changed. For example, if a new hazard emerges (say a pandemic), you might incorporate public health training and PPE stockpiling as new milestones. Link new items to FPA resources if available (perhaps the Compass Guide has an annex on pandemics, etc.).  
- Recommit to the refined plan: ensure all members, especially any new ones, are briefed on the current roadmap. Phase 2 ideally concludes when you have a mature, functioning squad, but even then the maintenance and improvement continues indefinitely (and transitions into Phase 3 tasks of networking more broadly).
