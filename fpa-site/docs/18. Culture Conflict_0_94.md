Cultural Resilience = Shared Identity Stronger than Differences: By heavily investing in a culture of trust, honesty, and accountability (Section V), we forge a strong shared identity. Members identify with FPA’s values deeply. So, when conflict arises, they frame it as a problem to solve together, not a battle of enemies. Even if they vehemently disagree on an issue, the underlying respect and common purpose remain. This is akin to a family that fights internally but ultimately sticks together – the bonds of trust act like a rubber band pulling members back from the brink of separation. Moreover, by encouraging constructive conflict and dissenting voices inside the tent, we ensure that innovative or minority views don’t have to leave to be expressed; they can exist within FPA’s big tent. Over decades, this broad but coherent culture can accommodate diversity of thought without cracking.
