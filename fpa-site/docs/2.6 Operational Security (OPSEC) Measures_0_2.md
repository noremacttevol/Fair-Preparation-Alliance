OPSEC refers to the practices FPA uses to protect sensitive information and plans from falling into the wrong hands. Given that knowledge of who has what supplies or where members are gathering could be exploited by malicious actors (looters, hostile groups, or even overly curious authorities), FPA places strong emphasis on OPSEC throughout its operations. Key OPSEC measures include: Need-to-Know Information Sharing – Members are only given information relevant to their role or local area. For example, a member knows the identities and addresses of their immediate chapter mates but might not know details about distant chapters unless necessary (so if one member is compromised, they can’t expose the whole network). Similarly, details of supply caches or evacuation routes are compartmentalized; only those involved in maintaining or using a cache know its exact location. Use of Codes and Codenames – In communications, especially over potentially monitored channels like radio, FPA uses pre-arranged codewords for locations, people, or statuses. For instance, a chapter might refer to their meetup spot as “Depot Blue” instead of the actual name, or use a phrase like “checking on Aunt Mae” to signify checking a particular cache or safehouse. Each chapter develops a set of brevity codes (often updated periodically) for key messages to avoid giving away intent to eavesdroppers (detailed in [[Communication Protocols and Etiquette]]).
