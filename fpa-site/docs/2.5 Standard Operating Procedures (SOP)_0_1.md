Meeting and Reporting Schedules: In routine times, SOP might require local chapters to meet at least once a month (physically or virtually) and report a summary to regional coordinators. It may also set a schedule for national leadership calls or Realnet forum updates (ensuring information flows regularly).  
Operational Security Measures: Rules around sharing information: e.g., never post identifiable personal prep details on public forums, use encryption for sensitive communications, maintain cover stories if needed (members might refer to FPA just as a “camping club” or similar publicly). This ties into [[Operational Security (OPSEC) Measures]] and [[Member Privacy and Data Security]].  
Resource Storage and Cache Protocols: The SOP advises on how to store supplies safely (with rotation schedules for perishable goods), possibly the creation of group caches. It might outline that certain items (like extra fuel, medical kits) are kept in secure caches accessible to the chapter in case someone’s home cache is compromised. Access to caches might be controlled by multiple members (to enforce trust through mutual oversight).
