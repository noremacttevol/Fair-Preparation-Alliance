Effective outreach is not a one-time effort or a single channel – it is an **ecosystem of communication** that spans _before, during, and after_ an emergency. FPA’s strategy breaks this into three phases, each with distinct objectives and methods, all interlinked:  
1. **Pre-Event (Preparedness Phase – “Peacetime”)** – Outreach during calm periods, primarily online and in communities, to build awareness, skills, and networks.  
2. **During Event (Crisis Phase – “Battlestations”)** – Communications when disaster strikes, leveraging Outernet, HAM radio, and analog methods to maintain the flow of information and coordination.  
3. **Post-Event (Recovery Phase – “Rebuilding”)** – Outreach in the aftermath, aiding recovery efforts, debriefing, and replicating successful local models elsewhere.  
Each phase is crucial. Pre-event outreach lays the groundwork that makes crisis communications feasible. Crisis-phase comms are the execution of everything we prepared. Post-event outreach helps solidify lessons and expand our reach for next time. Below, we detail each phase.
