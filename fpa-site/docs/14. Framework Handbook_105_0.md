Perhaps the most futuristic aspect of Mk1Mod3 is the built-in AI assistant (nicknamed “FPAi”). Unlike typical cloud-based assistants, FPAi runs locally on your device and is fine-tuned for emergency preparedness. Here’s what it can do:  
- **Interactive Q&A:** You can ask questions in natural language (text or voice). For example, “How do I treat a deep cut?” The AI will draw from the SHTF Bible and medical guides to give you a concise, step-by-step answer. It’s like having an experienced mentor on call. During crises when human experts might be unavailable, this quick guidance can be invaluable. (We do remind users: AI advice is a help, not gospel – use judgment and cross-check if possible.)  
- **Decision Support:** The AI helps weigh options. Ask, “Should we evacuate or stay put?” and it might list factors to consider (e.g., flood risk at your location, official guidance, your squad’s resources). It won’t command you, but it acts as a smart checklist, ensuring you consider key points.  
- **Data Analysis:** FPAi can crunch numbers or summarize information. You might input, “We have water for 40 people at 2 liters/day; how many days will it last?” and it will calculate that. Or it can condense a long situation report into bullet points. This is handy for squad leaders processing lots of input during a crisis.
