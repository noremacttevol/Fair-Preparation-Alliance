- **Transparency and Member Inclusion:** Governance & Oversight also manages how information about governance is shared. They hold periodic **all-hands meetings** or publish governance reports so members know what decisions are being made at the top. Minutes of major leadership meetings are often shared (with some redactions for sensitive info), because secrecy breeds distrust. They encourage members to participate in governance through committees or local leadership roles – basically grooming the next set of leaders. They might run a “Leadership Academy” workshop with Readiness, teaching interested members about governance and management, thus building internal capacity and demonstrating that leadership isn’t some closed club. The idea is any member should _feel_ they could have a voice or even a seat at the leadership table if they put in the work. That openness keeps the Alliance fair and dynamic.
