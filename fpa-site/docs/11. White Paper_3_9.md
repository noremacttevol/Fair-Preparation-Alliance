_Lessons learned:_ It’s not just about having stuff, it’s about having the _right stuff and knowing how to use it_. A common mistake is focusing on flashy gear while neglecting basics like water and medications. After a regional blackout drill, we found many members had multiple tactical flashlights but **not enough drinking water** stored. Lesson: prioritize ruthlessly – water, food, warmth, and medicine come first. Another lesson: **rotation and maintenance.** Stockpiles aren’t “set and forget.” People have opened their bug-out bags in a real emergency only to find spoiled food or leaky batteries. We emphasize low-cost approaches to maintenance: for example, calendar reminders to rotate water every 6 months (it’s free, just labor) or using up stored pantry food in normal times before expiration and replacing it. Also, _skills_ are part of provisioning – knowing how to purify water or cook off-grid can extend limited supplies. A past FPA drill revealed that few members knew how to safely run a generator or even a charcoal grill indoors (which you should **never** do due to carbon monoxide). So, we learned to pair supplies with training (e.g., having a camp stove + practicing using it outdoors). Lastly, feedback from low-income members taught us that building a 14-day supply is doable on a budget by gradually **incremental prepping** – e.g., each grocery trip buy a couple of extra cans. The lesson: consistency beats splurging. Five dollars a week towards your kit adds up.
