**Lessons Learned:** We discovered that letting squads figure it out organically worked to a point, but official guidance helped avoid turf battles or hurt feelings. One lesson was to involve all members in the discussion – when a merger was first floated in one area, leaders talked only among themselves and some members felt blindsided; we corrected that by requiring an all-hands meeting and vote for such changes. Another lesson: we set benchmarks to prompt consideration – e.g., if a squad exceeds 30 regularly active members, time to consider splitting for manageability; if it falls below 6, consider merging or recruiting. But we also learned not to force it – local context matters (maybe 40 well-organized folks can still function as one squad if they break into teams internally). Flexibility within a framework turned out to be key.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Define criteria for potential squad reorganization: membership count thresholds (upper and lower), geographic considerations (like squads overlapping or being very distant), and activity level (e.g., an inactive squad might merge into a neighboring one to revitalize).
