Structured Escalation = Channel for Every Dispute: Our escalation ladder (Section IV) ensures no one hits a dead-end. If a solution isn’t found at one level, there’s always a higher level to appeal to, culminating in the Movement Council. Thus, even if someone is unhappy with a circle’s decision, they have an avenue to seek a movement-level review rather than choosing to exit. This reduces the likelihood of breakaway groups forming out of frustration. It also means local conflicts don’t automatically infect the whole organization – they can be quarantined and resolved in an orderly way without derailing others. Knowing that every conflict can be resolved somewhere, people have patience with the process instead of resorting to drastic measures.
