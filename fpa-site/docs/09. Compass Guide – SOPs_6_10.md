In summary, **the FPA way has been engineered through hard lessons and practical logic**. None of these systems – small squads, fair sharing, token dues, merit-based rank, hybrid AI use, offline backups, strict SOPs, radical transparency – are arbitrary. Each addresses a specific problem that has tripped up other efforts or could threaten our mission. The Compass Guide exists to spell out these whys, so that when you follow an FPA rule, you’re not doing it “because I said so,” but because you understand the solid reasoning behind it. If you ever catch yourself wondering “Why does the FPA do X?”, check back here – chances are it’s explained. And if it’s not, ask! (Chances are _you_ found a way to improve us – and continuous improvement means we’ll adapt and add a new explanation for it.)
