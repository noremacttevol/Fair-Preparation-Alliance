Potential Pitfalls: A known dysfunction is avoidance of accountability, which we combat as described. But we must also avoid the other extreme: excessive peer scrutiny could tip into a feeling of micromanagement or lack of autonomy. We address that by balancing feedback with empowerment – peers give input but don’t control each other’s work. Also, accountability discussions are ideally private and respectful, not public shaming. If someone feels ganged up on by peers, that’s counterproductive. Thus, our mediators and Liaisons are alert to situations where what should be constructive peer feedback turns into bullying or scapegoating. Any sign of cliques enforcing norms in a toxic way (e.g., ostracizing someone) is treated as a serious cultural breach. We emphasize accountability behaviors: focus on the action or result, not personal attributes, and always pair critique with an invitation to problem-solve together.
