- **Build a first aid kit (budget-friendly):** Assemble a personal first aid kit if you haven’t. It doesn’t need to be a $200 pre-made bag. Use a tackle box or Tupperware and include basics: bandages, gauze, adhesive tape, antiseptic, scissors, tweezers, gloves, pain relievers, etc. Many items can be bought at dollar stores or in bulk and split. Reference the FPA Compass Guide or Red Cross checklist for contents. After training, add advanced items you’re trained to use (e.g., tourniquet, chest seal) – and label them if others might use your kit.  
- **Home emergency drill with first aid:** Incorporate first aid into your home drills. Example: during a family drill, pretend someone sprains an ankle while evacuating or gets a “bleeding” cut (use moulage or red marker for effect). Practice the treatment steps: cleaning a wound, wrapping a sprain, etc. This not only reinforces your skills but also normalizes taking action despite a little chaos.  
- **Leverage FPA mentorship:** If you’ve completed training, volunteer to share that knowledge. Host a short skill-share at an FPA meet-up or in the app forums. Conversely, if you can’t attend formal training, link up with a fellow member who did – maybe they can show you some basics one-on-one. Peer training is better than none.
