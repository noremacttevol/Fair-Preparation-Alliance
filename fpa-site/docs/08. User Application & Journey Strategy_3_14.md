- **Trust Safeguards:** As AI takes a bigger role (in vetting and guiding), safeguards outlined in the [[Trust Doctrine]] are actively employed. For example, if the **AI gives questionable advice** to a user, there’s a mechanism for the user to flag it, and an admin or “AI Ranger” will review and correct it – akin to the **Trust Firewall System (TFS)** that auto-patches serious AI mistakes and alerts a local council if needed. The app interface might include a “Report issue” button on content, feeding into these trust protocols. FPA might run **trust drills** even in Phase2 (simulating a misinformation incident in a squad to see if members catch and correct it), reinforcing a culture of vigilance.
