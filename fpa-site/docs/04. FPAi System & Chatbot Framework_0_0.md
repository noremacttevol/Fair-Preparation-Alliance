INSTRUCTION FOR GPT REWRITE · FPA Mk1Mod3 · 04. FPAi System & Chatbot Framework.md  
This note is part of a coordinated 21-file rewrite. The system has accumulated inconsistencies in terminology, outdated references, and fragmented logic. Your task is to:  
✅ Standardize terminology across the Mk1Mod3 system.
✅ Flag and fix misalignments between sections and related files.
✅ Deeply interlink this note with all other Mk1Mod3 documents using [[Note Name]] format.
✅ Maintain original meaning — but clarify, consolidate, and format for coherence.
✅ DO NOT create new ideas or models — restructure only based on what exists.  
Known systemic issues to watch for:
- Terms, role names, or procedures that differ between files and need unification.
- Notes that refer to concepts covered elsewhere without linking or quoting.
- Updates to frameworks or protocols that aren't reflected consistently.
- Lack of clear flow between orientation → training → execution → governance → feedback.  
Your rewrite goal:
Clarify how AI agents interact with FPA components. Clean up terminology, distinguish system roles vs. GPT roles, and link to all impacted notes.  
Audience:
GPT engineers, AI operations teams
