- Define the council’s scope in writing (a simple charter): e.g., “Council coordinates national initiatives and upholds alliance principles; it does not interfere in operational decisions of squads unless coordination is required across regions.” Make this transparent to all members to alleviate concerns.  
- Establish meeting routines: monthly strategic calls, and emergency sessions whenever a multi-region disaster occurs. Use multi-platform approach – internet conferencing when available, HF radio net as backup, plus ensure minutes are recorded (and later distributed via email or Outernet for transparency).  
- Give the council some teeth in governance but also checks: for example, the council can propose amendments to FPA guidelines, but these might require ratification by a wider vote of squads (to avoid disconnect). Outline such processes so everyone knows the rules of the game.  
- Create working groups under the council for specific tasks (mirroring some Phase 3 topics): e.g., an Outernet working group, a Training standardization group, etc., headed by council members but involving other volunteers. This spreads the work and keeps non-council members engaged in decision-making.
