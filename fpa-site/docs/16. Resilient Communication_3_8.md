Finally, note that amateur radio is also a **force multiplier** beyond just communication: it gives us intel. A battery-powered shortwave receiver can pull in news from hundreds of miles away when the internet is gone. A network of FPA radio operators can act as the ears of the Alliance across a region, reporting on conditions, threats, and opportunities. Information is power in a disaster, and HAM radio is our information pipeline. We will train for it, we will invest in it, and we will use it ethically and effectively, in line with our Trust Doctrine (e.g., verifying information before acting).
