- **Amateur (HAM) Radio Networks:** **Ham radio** has famously filled the communication gap when everything else fails ([Amateur radio emergency communications - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_emergency_communications#:~:text=Recent%20examples%20include%20the%20September,1)). FPA fully integrates amateur radio into our crisis outreach plan. Before events, we encourage members to get their HAM licenses and set up radios. During an event, we activate an **Emergency Net** on predetermined frequencies. For instance, each region might have a designated HF frequency for long-range and a VHF/UHF for local line-of-sight that our members monitor. Trained radio operators in our ranks (and friendly operators we’ve networked with) will take shifts acting as Net Control, coordinating information flow. Critical features of our HAM strategy:  
- We use **clear text** (no codes that would exclude listeners) so that even unlicensed folks with just a radio scanner can benefit from the information. We’re not passing state secrets; we want the public informed.
