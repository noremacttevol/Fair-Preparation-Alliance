A core operational upgrade in Mk1Mod3 is the formal **squad structure**. Instead of individuals preparing in isolation or loose, undefined groups, FPA now organizes members into cohesive squads with assigned roles. This structure borrows from best practices in emergency response and military small-unit organization, but itâ€™s tailored for civilian community use.
