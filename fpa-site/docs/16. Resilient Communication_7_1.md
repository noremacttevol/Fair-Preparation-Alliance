- **Emergency Calls:** How to make a distress call or SOS over radio, and how to respond to one (e.g., the standard “Mayday” or local equivalent for life-threatening emergencies, or “All-call” for Alliance-wide urgent broadcasts).  
- **Protocol & Etiquette:** Understanding when to speak and when to listen. Phase 1 trainees learn the importance of not clogging the channel with chatter, especially during an incident. The concept of a **net control station** is introduced – i.e. in a busy communication scenario, one station may direct the flow of messages.  
- **Backup Communication Methods:** Phase 1 also covers the very basics of what to do if radios fail. For instance, they are taught a simple _rally plan_: “If you can’t reach anyone on the radio, move to Location X or display Signal Y.” This could be as simple as a colored flag or marker outside their home to indicate status when electronic comms are down. It’s the first taste of fallback logic.  
- **Drills:** Before being considered Phase 1 proficient, a member must participate in at least one communications drill or exercise. An example drill: the chapter calls a “radio silence test” where grid power is cut (simulate blackout) and all Phase 1 members must attempt to contact their squad leader via FRS radio within 30 minutes. Their success/failure and improvisation is evaluated. This builds confidence and reveals who might panic or falter without a phone – which instructs further mentoring.
