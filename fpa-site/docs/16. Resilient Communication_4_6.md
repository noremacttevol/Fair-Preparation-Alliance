**Resilience and Redundancy:** Each mobile unit is built to be rugged. Pelican cases, waterproofing, shock-proof foam inserts, etc., are standard. EMP resilience is addressed by having backup critical electronics shielded. Additionally, **redundancy** is key: the unit provides overlap with individual gear. For example, each member might carry a personal hand-held radio, but the unit’s higher-powered mobile radio and better antenna dramatically extend range when set up. If a member’s device fails, the unit’s devices fill the gap. Likewise, a member’s small solar charger is backed up by the unit’s more robust solar array. This layering ensures that even if a few pieces go down, the squad as a whole still has capability. Units also allow **interoperability** – since they carry multiple comm methods, a squad can act as a relay or bridge. For instance, using the unit’s HAM radio to talk to an adjacent region’s team while simultaneously using FRS to talk to a local unlicensed volunteer group, effectively linking groups that otherwise couldn’t talk. The computing module can interface with the radio for digital modes (if pre-arranged, e.g. sending text data via HF), though that is an advanced use case.
