This adaptive approach is informed by competency-based education practices: tracking specific competencies allows training to be tailored to an individual’s needs. In education, for instance, knowing exactly which skills a student is lacking means an instructor can target those areas rather than re-teaching what the student already knows. Studies in fields like healthcare education emphasize that competency tracking promotes comprehensive improvement and confidence by focusing on weaknesses. We apply the same principle via AI – identifying each member’s weaknesses and actively guiding them to improve – thereby raising overall preparedness. As the member follows these tailored recommendations and logs new completions, FPAi will update their Skill Wheel and survivability score accordingly, creating a motivating feedback loop of improvement.
