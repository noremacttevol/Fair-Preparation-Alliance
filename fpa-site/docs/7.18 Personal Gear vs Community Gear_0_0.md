FPA distinguishes between personal gear (items each individual or family keeps for their own use) and community or shared gear (larger or less-common items pooled for group benefit). Personal gear includes the basics everyone should have: their own go-bag with clothes, personal meds, a flashlight, knife, etc., and home supplies like food, water, a first aid kit. The Alliance provides guidelines for these so every member can be self-sufficient at least 72 hours or more. On the other hand, community gear might be things that not everyone needs to buy duplicates of, due to expense or bulk: examples are heavy tools (chainsaw, large tent, water purification station), advanced medical equipment (like a field trauma kit or defibrillator), communication infrastructure (long-range radios, repeaters), cooking equipment for many people (big pots, grills), or transportation assets (an inflatable boat, an off-road handcart). These are often stored centrally or with designated caretakers. The concept is efficient resource use â€“ one well-maintained chainsaw accessible to the group is better than ten cheap ones gathering dust. FPA organizes how community gear is stored and accessed: for instance, a chapter might keep a trailer stocked with community equipment that can be hitched and brought to a disaster site where members gather. They also make plans for sharing personal gear when needed; e.g., if someone has a skill (like a ham operator) but another member has the actual high-frequency
