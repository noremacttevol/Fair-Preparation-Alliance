Having a trove of information is futile if people can’t access it when needed, so FPA plans carefully for knowledge access during emergencies. This involves multiple strategies:  
- Distributed Copies: Key info (like emergency action checklists, comms frequencies, medical protocols) is distributed to members beforehand in printed form or pocket reference cards. Each team leader might carry a USB with the vault on their keychain.  
- Offline Servers: As noted in offline repositories, some chapters maintain a battery-powered mini server or even just a tablet that anyone can use on the spot to look up data. For instance, at a basecamp or shelter, they might set up a laptop as a kiosk with the vault and offline library open for reference.  
- Radio Broadcasts of Info: An innovative practice is that FPA can use radio to share knowledge on the fly – say there’s an outbreak and people need to know how to sanitize water, a ham operator might literally read the procedure on-air at regular intervals, turning radio into an audio library. Or they use slow-scan TV or digital text modes to transmit specific documents to others who can’t directly access the vault.
