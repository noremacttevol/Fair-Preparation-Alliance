Q1: What is the FPA “Trust Doctrine” and why is it important?
A: The “Trust Doctrine” is FPA’s formal code of conduct designed to maintain strong trust among members. Prepping communities can be secretive and wary (for security reasons), so FPA uses the Trust Doctrine to encourage openness and cooperation within the group. It lays out values like honesty, mutual respect, and confidentiality. For example, members agree not to exploit each other or spread sensitive information outside the alliance – what you share with FPA stays in FPA. In return, everyone commits to helping one another and sharing knowledge in good faith. Essentially, the Trust Doctrine is a pledge all members take: to act with integrity, share resources fairly, and keep each other’s trust. By having these principles clearly stated, FPA ensures that a group of individual preppers can work together confidently, knowing everyone is held to the same ethical standard.
