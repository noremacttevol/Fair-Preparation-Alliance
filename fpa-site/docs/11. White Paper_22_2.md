- Outline who does what in a disaster scenario: e.g., Red Cross runs shelters, FPA squads can help by distributing relief supplies or doing wellness checks in areas they can’t get to quickly. Document these complementary roles in a simple reference guide (possibly added to the Trust Doctrine appendix for external partners).  
- Establish liaison positions similar to FEMA’s: assign FPA points-of-contact to interface with each major NGO during incidents. For example, have a Red Cross liaison in each region’s FPA relay squad who exchanges information with the Red Cross EOC rep.  
- Integrate communications: if NGOs use radio (Red Cross has some radio networks, TR uses cell apps), see if we can share a channel or at least monitor each other. Or simply swap important phone numbers and include them in the registry under contacts.  
- Offer resources smartly: if FPA has supply caches (coming in later milestones), inform NGOs that these exist and can be tapped in an emergency to support their operations. Conversely, if an NGO has excess donations of something, they might route to FPA for harder-to-reach families.  
- Join coordination groups (which leads to the next milestone, VOAD) – many NGOs coordinate through those, and having FPA present as a member solidifies these partnerships.
