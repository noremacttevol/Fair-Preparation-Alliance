Recognition and Reinforcement: We also recognize teams and individuals who exemplify peer accountability and support. For example, an award or shout-out for a squad that effectively resolved a tough conflict on their own (demonstrating maturity), or a mention in the newsletter for a member who consistently helps others stay on track in a kind way. By celebrating these behaviors, we signal that the Alliance values mutual accountability as a strength, not as nosiness. This positive reinforcement encourages everyone to be each other’s keepers in the best possible way.  
Support Systems: Accountability should come with support. When someone is struggling and their peers call it out, we ensure there are resources to help them improve (mentoring, training, perhaps workload adjustment if burnout is an issue). The ethos is not “catch and punish” but “observe and assist, with firm expectations.” For instance, if a peer calls out another for missing commitments, the next step might be the team offering help to reorganize or prioritize so it doesn’t happen again. By solving problems rather than just pointing fingers, we create a supportive accountability loop that strengthens trust (one can rely on teammates to be honest and helpful).
