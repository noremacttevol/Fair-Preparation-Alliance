Q10: How does FPA integrate new technology (like apps or AI) into prepping?
A: FPA is open to useful technology that can enhance preparedness, as long as it doesn’t create dependency or violate the alliance’s ethos. For example, FPA might have its own app for members – possibly the one mentioned as the Fair Protection Alliance app – which could facilitate communication, knowledge sharing, alerts, and tracking of personal preparedness goals. AI could be used to analyze data or help with scenario planning (like predicting which areas need more attention, or personalizing training based on a member’s profile). They might use AI-driven simulators to create more realistic training scenarios. However, FPA would also caution about over-reliance on tech: any app or tool should have an offline backup, since in true crises technology can fail. The alliance likely encourages members to use mapping apps, digital checklists, and online forums for learning, but also stresses printing out key documents (like the Compass Guide), keeping hard copies of maps, and practicing skills without gadgets. In essence, FPA embraces tech as a force multiplier for coordination and learning (like using a group chat or emergency notification system among members), but everything tech-based is complemented by low-tech resilience.
