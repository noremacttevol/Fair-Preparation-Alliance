Adaptable Governance: Our framework will not ossify. We have an amendment process built in: say every 5 years (or as needed), a committee reviews this Conflict & Resilience framework in light of recent experience and new insights, and proposes updates. Those updates would be ratified by whatever governing method the Alliance sees fit (member vote, Council approval, etc., as per our constitution). This ensures that, while the spirit remains the same, the tactics and structures can adapt to changing times or scaling of the Alliance. For instance, if in 20 years FPA is ten times larger and global, we might need additional layers or digital tools to manage conflict that we incorporate then. The key is we are not afraid to evolve our approaches â€“ resilience is not rigidity. As long as changes undergo due scrutiny and align with our core values, we welcome improvements to this living document.
