- **Crisis Activation:** If “Day Zero” (a major collapse scenario) actually hits in Phase3, the FPA is designed to seamlessly transition to offline mode. All those drills and offline tools come to bear. From a user’s perspective, this is the climax of their journey: they have been prepared to act without needing to rely on the central app or even electricity. Squads switch to radio coordination, leaders follow the Incident Command system as defined in the PACIFR plan (Preparation Alliance Conflict/Incident Framework) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=protocol:%20day%20zero%20triple%20redundancy,always%20include%20fallback%20strategy%20recommendations-p383gle/)), and members use their printed guides and training to respond. The app’s final act before going dark (if infrastructure fails) might be to push a “Emergency Activation” message to all, then it’s up to the **people**. Thanks to Phase1 and 2’s groundwork, _“FPA squads roll offline without missing a beat.”_ Each user’s journey empowered them to be self-reliant yet networked; Phase3 ensures the network can sustain itself through the members.
