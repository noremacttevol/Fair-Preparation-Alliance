Modern society faces a new normal of overlapping and cascading crises. In the past, disasters often came one at a time with ample breathing room for recovery. Today, however, multiple crises can strike concurrently or sequentially, compounding their impacts. For example, a severe storm can trigger floods and power outages while a pandemic strains emergency services – all before communities have recovered from the last event. Climate change, global interconnectivity, and fragile infrastructure mean that shocks are more likely to “pile on,” unleashing new problems before the initial crisis has passed.  
This convergence of hazards has exposed gaps in traditional preparedness. Government agencies and individual households alike often plan for isolated incidents – a hurricane _or_ a cyberattack _or_ a pandemic. But what happens when these events collide? **Cascading crises** amplify each other, overwhelming systems that were designed for single emergencies. The result is longer recoveries, higher costs, and greater loss of life and livelihood.  
**Why a new approach?** The Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) believes that in this age of complex risks, preparedness must evolve. We need a framework that is _holistic_, _adaptive_, and _community-driven_. This means:  
- **Strategic foresight:** anticipating compound scenarios rather than one-off events.
