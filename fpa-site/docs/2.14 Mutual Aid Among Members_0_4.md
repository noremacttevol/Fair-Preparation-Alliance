though usually social dynamics handle it). Scaling Up: On a chapter level, mutual aid is direct. Between chapters (regionally), it can also occur: if one chapter’s area is hit by disaster and another nearby is not, the unaffected chapter may send supplies or people to assist. For example, after a hurricane, an inland chapter might convoy in with fuel and water for a coastal chapter. This is facilitated by Realnet communications and pre-regional planning. In summary, mutual aid is the practical implementation of FPA’s fairness and community values. It turns individual preparedness into a safety net that’s far stronger. Time and again in FPA exercises and actual events, this mutual aid ethos has proven its worth – members quickly see that a group that has each other’s backs can tackle challenges (from clearing fallen trees to deterring crime to saving a life) that any one of them alone could not. (Cross-ref: [[Membership Philosophy and Benefits]] – mutual aid is one of the prime benefits that attract people to FPA, knowing they won’t be alone. Also [[Public Image and Perception Management]] – showing mutual aid success can improve how others see prepping.)
