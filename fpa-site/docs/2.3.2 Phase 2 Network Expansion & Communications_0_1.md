if digital comms are fragmented). The alliance’s organization scales up – regional coordinators emerge to link local efforts, ensuring that, for example, a lightly affected area can send help to a devastated area. Another major aspect of Phase 2 is mutual aid and resource sharing. Based on the groundwork in Phase 1, members now execute plans to help each other: they pool resources at safehouses or predetermined caches, perform duties like security shifts, community watch, and medical support for the group. If one member’s area is hit by a disaster (e.g., their neighborhood floods or faces civil unrest), nearby FPA members coordinate through Realnet/ham to assist with evacuation or supplies, according to the [[Emergency Activation Protocols]]. The alliance essentially activates as an independent emergency support organization for its members and potentially trusted neighbors. Security and OPSEC remain high priority: as public systems falter, FPA instructs members to be vigilant. [[Physical Security Measures]] are implemented collectively (teams might guard a perimeter around a group shelter or escort convoys of family members moving to safer locations). All communication on networks uses code names or ciphers where possible ([[Communication Security (COMSEC)]] measures) to prevent eavesdroppers from identifying FPA locations or resources.
