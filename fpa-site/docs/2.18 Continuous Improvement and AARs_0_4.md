Ultimately, this commitment to continuous improvement ensures that FPA doesn’t stagnate or become overconfident. They remain humble in the face of evolving challenges, always asking, “How can we do better next time?” This relentless refinement of their processes and skills significantly raises their resilience and is a hallmark of FPA’s professionalism as a prepper network. (Cross-ref: [[Test My Plan Program]] – an example of building improvement into the preparation process, and [[Evolution of FPA Strategy]] in the Innovations category, which on a larger scale reflects continuous improvement of the Alliance’s overall strategy.)
