Imagine a hurricane is forecast in 5 days. FPA sees spikes in requests for plywood, generators, and water containers. Here’s how dynamic logistics respond:  
- We announce that we have emergency stock of these items at the chapter depot. All members can request what they truly need by a deadline. No cost increase – actually, we decide to make water containers free (thanks to a donation) and plywood at minimal charge. Generators are limited, so we allocate by a needs matrix (medical or vulnerable families first). Those who get one will pay via points or at cost; those who don’t get one are assured we’ll pool help to share the ones we have.  
- A Supporter-tier member who already has a generator might voluntarily relinquish their “slot” to someone in an Assisted tier who needs it for medical equipment – that Supporter gets recognized and maybe given some points for future use as thanks.  
- After the hurricane, resources are reshuffled: maybe some areas have excess food while others need it. Through the app, squads list excess and needs, and we arrange swaps. No one is price-gouging bottled water at $50; instead, the network treats water as a shared asset and our funding covers delivering it where needed. Members keep track with points just to account for things, but essentially it’s more of a mutual aid ledger than a market.
