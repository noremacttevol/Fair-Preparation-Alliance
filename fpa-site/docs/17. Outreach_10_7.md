This human-in-the-loop verification means information travels a bit slower than a tweet, but when it reaches you, you can trust that multiple people had eyes on it. In practice, FPA has built a **culture of verification**. We train members to habitually question and confirm. Even something as simple as a forwarded WhatsApp message in our groups will often be accompanied by a member asking “Source?” and others providing it, or debunking if false. This is an almost journalistic or intelligence-community mindset, instilled into everyday volunteers.
