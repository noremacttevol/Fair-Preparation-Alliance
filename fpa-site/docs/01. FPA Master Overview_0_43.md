Emergency Response Teams (ERTs): Within the Alliance, Readiness & Drills spearheads the formation of specialized quick-reaction units or “go-teams.” These Emergency Response Teams are groups of highly trained volunteers ready to deploy on short notice to a crisis outside their home area (for instance, helping a neighboring state after a disaster). This team ensures ERT members get advanced training in incident command, working alongside first responders, and being self-sufficient in disaster zones. They coordinate with Core and Tech to pre-position caches of gear for ERTs (portable comm kits, medical supplies, tools). They also drill the ERTs specifically on rapid mobilization – e.g., can Team Alpha gear up and depart within 4 hours of a call? ERTs often become our public face during crises, so Readiness makes sure they perform professionally and actually help (not just well-intentioned amateurs showing up).
