an important historical milestone was when the founders introduced the multi-phase framework (Mark I Mod 1 at that time) – dividing the Alliance’s growth and action plan into phases. After initial small-scale success and refinement (Mark I Mod II introduced more formal roles and the beginnings of the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] concept), FPA expanded via word of mouth and discreet outreach. By the time of Mark I Mod III (the current framework), the Alliance had grown beyond its original locale to a national footprint with numerous chapters and a recognized internal culture (trust, fairness, tech-augmented prep). Over time, certain events underscored the need for FPA’s approach: for example, when a severe hurricane hit one of the regions where FPA had members, the coordination and mutual aid those members provided (compared to non-associated preppers who struggled alone) proved the model. Such experiences strengthened resolve and attracted more members after the fact.
