but a power outage stops it, and a neighbor has solar to run it if they team up. The Trust Doctrine helps ensure community reliance doesn’t lead to freeloading – everyone is expected to contribute if they can. Also, being self-sufficient in attitude (not panicking, solving problems proactively) makes you a better community member. Conversely, having a community means your “self-sufficiency” extends beyond your own resources (the group’s overall sufficiency covers your gaps). In training, both aspects are covered: individual prepping (food, water, skills) and team exercises (patrols, group shelters). FPA’s view is ultimately pragmatic: be capable alone, but you’ll do better together. Or as they might put it, “Strong individuals make strong communities, and strong communities empower individuals.” [#Intermediate] [#Philosophy]
