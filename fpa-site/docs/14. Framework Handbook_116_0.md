Morning comes and the storm moves inland. The city is devastated: widespread flooding, power and water outages, plus news breaks that the chemical plant did leak some hazardous material into floodwaters. FPA shifts fully into relief mode:  
- **Search and Rescue:** Squads execute their post-storm SOPs. Able-bodied members form teams to check every home on their street for injured or trapped people. They mark cleared homes with chalk per CERT practice and communicate finds. In one case, Squad 7 rescues a non-member family trapped in an attic by rising water. Using a boat from an FPA volunteer (Tier 4 asset), they ferry them to a designated safe house. This is all done before official rescuers even reach that area.  
- **Establishing a Command Post:** The chapter sets up a central coordination point on high ground (a local school that FPA had pre-keyed for shelter use). They bring the equipment: generator, comms station, first aid station. This becomes a hub where members convene to organize further efforts and where the public soon comes for help because they see activity. On a bulletin board, they post information: a map of resources, schedule for community meals, safety advisories (like “Assume all floodwater is contaminated – wear boots and gloves” referencing the chemical spill).
