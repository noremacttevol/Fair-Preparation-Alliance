A living system thrives on feedback:  
- **After-Action Reviews:** Every significant operation or drill is followed by an after-action review (AAR). In these reviews, squads and observers discuss what went well and what didn’t. Critically, any lessons or suggestions that emerge are fed upward into the FPA’s knowledge loop. For instance, if multiple squads report that a certain SOP step was confusing, that’s flagged for revision. The culture is not to assign blame for mistakes, but to extract learning. These reviews are documented and added to a repository of lessons learned.  
- **Member Suggestions:** Beyond structured AARs, members at any time can submit suggestions or concerns – perhaps via the app’s feedback feature or in meetings. We encourage a mindset that **every member is a co-creator** of FPA. A Phase I recruit might have a fresh perspective that a veteran missed. All suggestions are taken seriously. They are logged (transparency again ensures they’re not ignored) and routed to the appropriate team or committee. For example, a tech suggestion goes to the Tech Committee, a training idea goes to the Training Committee, a governance suggestion might go to the Tribunal or full membership if broad.
