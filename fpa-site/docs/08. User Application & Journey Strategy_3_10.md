- **Progression & Rewards:** Phase2 activates the **member progression system** more formally. All new members start as **Rank E-1 (Entry level)**. The criteria for rising in rank are clearly laid out (as per the ORP – Operational Readiness Progression plan). For example, to reach E-2, a member might need to complete all onboarding tasks, attend one squad meeting or drill, and pass a basic knowledge quiz. The app tracks these milestones. **Ranks are tied to real actions**: completing a gear check, hosting a practice event, performing a radio contact, etc., all contribute to rank ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=,squad%20votes,%20regional%20mentoring/)). The **culture of accountability** is reinforced by making these visible – e.g., your profile might show “Tasks completed: 3/5 for next rank” encouraging continued engagement. **Peer verification** is required for certain tasks (especially higher ranks), in line with FPA’s mantra that trust is earned collectively. For instance, a squad leader or two squad peers must confirm a member actually participated in a drill for it to count. By Phase2, the app provides the interface for peers or leaders to give these sign-offs (perhaps a simple “thumbs-up” on an activity log), and may also allow photo proof uploads for things like gear prep. **Squad leaders can initiate promotion votes** or recommendations within the app, which the system then ratifies. This way, as the community grows, the
