- **Time-Based Role Decay (No Perpetual Titles):** In FPA, roles **aren’t held for life** – in fact, they naturally **expire if not actively renewed**. We institute term limits and a “role decay” mechanism to ensure fresh energy and continuous member trust. For key roles, there’s a set term (say 1 year for a council rep, 6 months for a squad lead, etc.), after which the role is up for reconfirmation or rotation. Even before a term ends, if you go inactive or stop contributing, your authority **diminishes over time**. It’s simple: _if you’re not around, your influence fades._ This prevents a scenario where someone who led a project two years ago still has veto power despite not being involved lately. Members have to **stay engaged to maintain their roles**. On the flip side, it opens space for active contributors to step up. This dynamic keeps the leadership landscape fair and fluid – nobody becomes a permanent bottleneck, and there’s always room for new talent to be recognized.
