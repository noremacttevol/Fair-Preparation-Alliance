- **Common Protocols:** Thanks to standardized SOPs and training, any squad can work alongside another. We use common radio call signs and jargon defined in the SOP Compass. In practical terms, this means during a statewide disaster, multiple squads can form an impromptu task force. One might handle first aid station setup, another manages a community kitchen, another does neighborhood damage assessment – each squad lead communicates on the alliance radio net to ensure efforts complement each other, not duplicate.  
- **Support from FPA Command:** Above the local chapters, FPA has a central coordination (think of it as a small HQ staff) monitoring large-scale events. If an incident overwhelms local squads, FPA Command can dispatch help from outside the area (including relaying requests to partner organizations or sending in specialized volunteers from other regions). Squads feed situational reports up through the communication chain. This multi-tier structure (squad -> chapter -> central) was refined in Mk1Mod3 to be faster and more organized than the previous version. It mirrors the Incident Command System’s scalability while staying community-focused.
