**Training and Education:** To turn an interested volunteer into a true interpreter of doctrine, we invest in education. This can be formal training programs – like a multi-week course (virtual or in-person) going through advanced topics of preparedness, crisis management, FPA philosophy, etc. We pair newcomers with mentors (seasoned interpreters) in a kind of apprenticeship. We encourage them to not just learn _what_ we do, but _why_ we do it that way. For example, anyone can read our procedure for verifying info, but in training we emphasize the rationale (like the historical failures we reviewed) so they internalize the importance. We also challenge them with scenarios: “If you were the only FPA member in X situation and you couldn’t reach anyone, what would you do?” and then discuss. This forces them to think like independent leaders. We share readings from our Trust Doctrine, Compass Guide, etc., almost like a curriculum or even a devotional – short daily readings to keep them steeped in the doctrine. Our **Dictionary** of terms also helps; by learning our common lexicon, they gain precision in communication and a sense of belonging to a tradition.
