Guiding Purpose: This framework explains how FPA will identify, process, and learn from internal conflict at all levels. It defines cultural resilience mechanisms that promote honesty, peer accountability, and adaptive evolution under pressure. It also embeds protections against abuse of these processes, ensuring that power is kept in check and that no member – including leadership – is above our principles. By codifying these practices, we harden FPA against fragmentation or collapse, preserving unity, trust, and integrity for generations. All members of the Alliance are expected to know and uphold these processes, treating this framework as a living constitution for our shared culture.  
I. Guiding Principles for Conflict & Resilience  
FPA’s approach to conflict is grounded in core principles that mirror our highest values:  
Trust and Good Faith: All interactions presume a baseline of trust and positive intent (per our Trust Doctrine). Members are expected to be truthful and to assume their peers are acting for the Alliance’s benefit unless proven otherwise. Trust is the foundation that allows candid dialogue – without trust, teams develop a fear of conflict that stifles honesty. Therefore, building and maintaining trust is our first priority in conflict handling.
