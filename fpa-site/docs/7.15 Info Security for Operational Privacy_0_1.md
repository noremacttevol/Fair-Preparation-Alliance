or the fact they store supplies at their home is shared only with consent and only to those who might need to assist. Operational security includes how they handle outreach: they may have public educational events but keep the membership list confidential. If working with partner organizations or authorities, they partition what info is shared. A “Privacy Officer” or similar role might exist to audit that documents and communications aren’t inadvertently exposing sensitive knowledge. The goal is to avoid scenarios where knowledge in the wrong hands could compromise safety (like a malicious actor knowing exactly which house to rob for supplies or intercepting communications). Thus, FPA innovates not just in gathering and using knowledge, but in shielding critical information behind layers of trust and security, ensuring they can operate effectively without tipping their hand to potential adversaries or causing panic.
