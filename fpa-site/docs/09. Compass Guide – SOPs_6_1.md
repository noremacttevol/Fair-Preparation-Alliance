- **Shared, Fair Resources:** FPA emphasizes **fairness** in knowledge and resource sharing. We created the **SHTF Bible** (our comprehensive survival manual) and the **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]** so that _everyone_ has access to critical information, not just a select few “experts.” We expect members to share tips, lessons learned, and even supplies when needed. Why? Because hoarding information or gear might give one person an edge, but sharing it gives the _whole community_ a fighting chance. In a true catastrophe, one family’s stockpile won’t rebuild a town – but an entire town’s combined skills and supplies just might. We do it the fair way because it’s the smart way for group survival.
