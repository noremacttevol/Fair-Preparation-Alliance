- Establish a support forum (can be an email list or radio hour) where station chiefs across regions share tips or issues – building a community of practice around the new tech.
**Contingency Plan:** Anticipate uneven adoption – have a mobile “support squad” ready (via radio or even traveling techs) to troubleshoot for regions that report problems. If a region’s receiver fails and no spare is available, temporarily aim a neighboring region’s receiver to also cover that area’s info needs (satellite footprint is broad, so one receiver can often serve multiple areas if they communicate the content). In case of a national satellite outage or service disruption, be prepared to fall back on other channels (like HF radio data or phone dial-up bulletin boards in a pinch) to disseminate critical info – essentially a slower, manual “Outernet” until automated service resumes. Maintain a small reserve fund from the previous milestone’s budget for quick replacements (if one unit gets fried by lightning, we shouldn’t have to beg for money again to replace it). Finally, keep local governments in the loop gently – if an emergency hits and they know FPA has these receivers, they might even assist with info-sharing or power generators, increasing the system’s resilience.
