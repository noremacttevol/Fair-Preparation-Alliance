Throughout this squad-level process, anti-abuse safeguards are in effect. All participants are expected to behave according to the ground rules (no yelling, no personal insults, maintain confidentiality, etc.). If at any point someone acts in bad faith – say one party refuses to participate in mediation, or uses the process to sling unfounded accusations – the mediator or panel can pause the process. In such cases, additional steps (like involving the Movement Council or a formal disciplinary channel) might be triggered to ensure the process isn’t undermined by one party’s obstinance. However, because the framework emphasizes good-faith resolution, such extreme situations are hopefully rare. The vast majority of peer conflicts should be resolved by Steps 1 or 2, with Step 3 as an occasional measure for tougher cases. By handling conflicts within squads in this structured way, we uphold peer accountability and trust: colleagues learn that they can work through issues on their own, without immediately running to higher authorities. This empowers teams and keeps relationships intact.
