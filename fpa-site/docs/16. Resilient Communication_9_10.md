Finally, integration means cross-referencing: this document (Section 16) should be used alongside those others. For example, when describing handling unknown groups on the radio, we’d refer to the Trust Doctrine’s guidance on vetting outsiders. When dealing with whether to share information, we consider Compass SOPs of operational security vs community responsibility. So cross-ref: - Trust Doctrine Section 5 (Hypothetical) might list authorized authentication methods – our comm procedure says “authenticate new voices as per Trust Doc Sec5 using challenge codes.” - Offline-First System Appendix might have the file structure of the offline tablet – we ensure comms people know how to navigate that to fetch a needed SOP quickly. - Gear Endorsements Table might have radio model numbers – we use those in examples and ensure training covers their specific quirks (like “the endorsed Midland GMRS radio has NOAA weather alert feature – use it to get weather info when internet is down”). - Compass SOP might define “Emergency Authority Levels” which tell when a squad can act on its own – our leadership comms section ties that in: e.g., “Code Black (Compass Level 3) invoked, squads autonomous until further notice.”  
By integrating in this way, all documents reinforce each other. Members studying this doctrine will see references to others and ideally be prompted to recall or review them, realizing it’s one big puzzle where each piece supports the image of a resilient alliance.
