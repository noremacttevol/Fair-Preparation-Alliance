Public Outreach & Recruitment: On the external side, Outreach works on growing our numbers and alliances. They manage the public face of FPA. This includes maintaining our public website content, any social media presence we use, running public workshops, and handling media relations. These are the folks who might host a booth at a preparedness expo or give a presentation at a town hall about community resilience. Their style is factual but relatable, avoiding any cultish vibe. Outreach emphasizes the fairness and community aspect of FPA to attract like-minded people: “We’re not here to sell fear; we’re here to share readiness. Join us, learn skills, and help make your community safer.” They highlight things like our dynamic pricing and transparency to build public trust. For recruitment, they produce brochures and flyers, run local ads if budget allows, or partner with friendly local businesses (outdoor gear shops, gun ranges, ham radio clubs) to spread the word. They track sign-up numbers and adjust strategy by region – if membership is lagging somewhere, they’ll concentrate outreach events there.
