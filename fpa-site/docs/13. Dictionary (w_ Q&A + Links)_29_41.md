Q42: Is it useful to coordinate with neighbors or friends on prepping?
A: It can be very beneficial, as long as you approach it wisely. A neighborhood that plans together will cope better than individuals on their own. If you have neighbors or local friends you trust, it’s worth discussing basic emergency plans with them – for example, agreeing to check on each other after a disaster, or sharing resources and skills. Coordinating can create a support system, so you’re not entirely on your own if things go bad. However, use discretion: not everyone will be interested or trustworthy. You don’t need to advertise all your supplies; start with simple conversations about general readiness or neighborhood safety. If you find a few like-minded neighbors, consider organizing a small preparedness group or team. A trusted community network is a huge asset in a crisis – just make sure to build it with people you have confidence in. [#Beginner] [#Community]
