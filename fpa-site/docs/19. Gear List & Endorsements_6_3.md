- **Price Monitoring and Alerts:** For endorsed gear, we maintain a system that monitors pricing over time. If a vendor suddenly hikes the price or if we spot price gouging (especially during emergencies), the Alliance will respond. We might issue a **Price Alert** to members: for example, “Notice: The price of [Endorsed Item] has increased 50% in the last month. We consider this price unfair – hold off on buying if possible while we investigate.” Then we’ll reach out to the vendor to ask why, or seek alternative sources. Similarly, if a great sale or drop occurs, we inform members quickly so they can take advantage. This dynamic tracking ensures the endorsement stays coupled with the notion of fair value. If fair value is lost, the endorsement may be reviewed (as mentioned, unethical pricing can be grounds to suspend or revoke an endorsement because it betrays the principle of fairness).
