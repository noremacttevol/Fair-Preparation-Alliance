- **Squad and Unit Coordination:** Core Coordination is also responsible for the **squad logic** functioning properly alliance-wide. They set guidelines for squad size and composition (e.g., target 10 members per squad, each with at least one member cross-trained in communications and one in medical, etc.). They ensure squads are grouped into larger units with competent leaders at each level. Core Coordination might, for example, decide to create a new company in a region if squads are getting too numerous under one command. They handle reassignments too: if one squad is weak due to drop-outs, they might merge it with another. If a squad excels, they might split it to seed leadership into new squads. All these adjustments are done to maintain a **balanced and strong force** everywhere. They also coordinate inter-squad drills and competitions to build camaraderie and a bit of **competitive spirit** – who can complete the mock disaster course fastest, etc. – making sure every squad strives for excellence.
