- **S – Secure & Summarize:** The final “S” stands for securing the scene and summarizing the event. Once the immediate crisis is stabilized or ended, the squad secures the area (making sure, for example, that a fire won’t reignite, or that the neighborhood is safe from any remaining threats). They then conduct a brief after-action review (AAR) – summarizing what happened, what was done, and what needs follow-up. This might include reporting outcomes to FPA central or local authorities, updating the alliance on lessons learned, and starting any recovery actions (like temporary repairs or planning a relief rotation).  
This COMPASS structure ensures that in any given SOP, members have a mental model and a sequence: Communicate, Observe, Mitigate, Plan, Adapt, Sustain, Secure. The mnemonic is easy to recall under stress (like “check your compass” to make sure you’re covering all bases). It avoids tunnel vision, where one might focus on, say, fighting a fire but forget to communicate, or focus on helping an injured person but forget personal safety.
