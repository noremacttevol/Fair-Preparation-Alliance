A core tenet of FPA resilience is **community formation** â€“ individual squads do not exist in a vacuum. From day one of a crisis (in fact, from day one of preparedness), we emphasize linking squads together into a robust network. This section details how squads interconnect, how we establish fallback communication nets when higher infrastructures fail, and how leadership transitions or signals are handled in a comms-degraded environment. The ultimate goal is a community that can maintain cohesion even if cut off from the outside world or central command.
