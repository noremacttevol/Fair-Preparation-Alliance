Strategic Planning & Mission Design: Core Coordination handles the big picture. This team (really the collection of top leaders and planners) translates the Alliance’s mission into concrete plans. They set objectives for each phase and make sure every content family knows its part in achieving them. For example, Core Coordination drafts the annual strategic outlook (like this Master Overview) and updates it as situations change. They constantly ask, “What’s our next priority? Training more medics in Region3? Stockpiling fuel before winter? Lobbying local authorities for emergency support?” Then they hammer out mission plans and campaign orders to meet those goals. During a crisis, Core Coordination acts as the war room – evaluating intel from Tech, readiness status from Drills, comms reports from Outreach, etc., then rapidly forming a coherent response plan for the Alliance.
