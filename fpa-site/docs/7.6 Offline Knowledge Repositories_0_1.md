they’ll consider saving an offline copy of it, anticipating it might not be reachable later. In chapter meetups, they sometimes have “Digital Download parties” where everyone brings hard drives and they synchronize their collections to ensure consistency and completeness. Some members have built homemade “Internet-in-a-box” devices: a small computer with a Wi-Fi AP serving all this content so anyone with a phone or laptop can connect and search as if they were on the internet. By establishing these offline repositories, FPA guarantees that even in a communications blackout, members have at their fingertips a treasure trove of knowledge – essentially the brain of human civilization up to the point of disconnection – which they can draw upon to solve problems and continue learning.
