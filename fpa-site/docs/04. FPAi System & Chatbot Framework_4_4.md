- **Member Rank = Trust Filter:** The FPA’s military-style rank ladder (E-1 up through O-10) isn’t just for show – it’s a trust and responsibility system. Higher-ranked members play a key role in overseeing and auditing FPAi’s outputs ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=%20rank%20system:%20filtering%20by,trust,%20not%20just%20code-dv476h/)). For example, squad leaders (E-5 and above) in each region act as **decentralized AI watchdogs** ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=ranks%20are%20earned,%20not%20claimed/)). They regularly review the answers and suggestions FPAi is giving to their squad members. If something seems off, they can report it or correct it. At the national level, a dedicated **AI Oversight Team** (with tech and ethics expertise) monitors the system’s overall performance and retraining cycles ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=answer:%20a%20dedicated%20ai%20oversight,updates,%20algorithms,%20and%20user%20feedback/)). They review AI updates before deployment, watch out for any bias or errors creeping in, and ensure the AI’s advice stays aligned with FPA’s mission and values. Moreover, **weekly audits** are conducted: transcripts of FPAi’s interactions (with any identifying user info removed) are examined by human reviewers for quality control
