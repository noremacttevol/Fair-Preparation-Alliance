AP isn’t just about individuals – it’s motivating the _whole community_. We celebrate top contributors. There may be a leaderboard (perhaps by alias if privacy is a concern) showing who’s putting in work – not to foster unhealthy competition, but to give credit and inspire others. The FPA may even offer small rewards: e.g. a special patch for the person with the most training hours in a quarter, or priority in receiving new gear prototypes to test.  
**Quality control:** To keep the system fair, most AP-earning activities require verification. You can’t just claim “I did a 24-hour solo survival trip” and get points unless someone can vouch for it or you provide some proof. Many tasks are group-observed by design, so this isn’t as hard as it sounds – e.g. your squad saw you at the drill, or your course certificate is your proof. Cheating the system would only hurt you and everyone else, and any blatant dishonesty is grounds for disciplinary action (we take integrity seriously). Plus, points or badges earned without real skill behind them will become obvious in the next emergency or challenge, and that embarrassment is on you. So do it right.
