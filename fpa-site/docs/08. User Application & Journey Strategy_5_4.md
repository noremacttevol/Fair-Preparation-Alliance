- **Enforcement by Community:** Culture is ultimately enforced by the members themselves, not just top-down rules. The user journey encourages this from the start: small things like members upvoting good gear tips or correcting misinformation in chats are normalized. The app might highlight “Community Alerts” – e.g., if someone posts a dubious tip (“store gasoline inside your house”), other users or the AI can flag it and provide correct info. Squads have the authority to warn or expel a member violating core rules, and thanks to the trust framework, they do so with legitimacy. The _TFS local override councils_ formalize this: if something or someone threatens trust (say a leader pushing an agenda), a council of a few respected members can convene (even virtually) to address it. Regular **trust drills** in Phase3 (simulating internal crises) train the community to act decisively and fairly when standards are challenged. From a user’s perspective, this means they are part of maintaining the Alliance’s integrity – e.g., as a squad member they might someday vote to remove an inactive or harmful member, or partake in a postmortem discussion after an incident. This responsibility shared at the user level keeps the culture strong and makes each member an active stakeholder in FPA’s trust network.
