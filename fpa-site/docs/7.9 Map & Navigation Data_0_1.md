as well, foreseeing scenarios of long-range evacuation. In digital form, they often use apps like OsmAnd or Gaia GPS preloaded with the entire region’s data on their phones (with external battery packs at the ready). They also distribute navigation sets: for example, a USB drive with offline maps and a how-to for installing on phones/laptops, often given to new members. Recognizing that maps can be worth their weight in gold, FPA also protects them – waterproof cases for important charts, multiple copies (one in your go-bag, one at home, one in the cache). Periodic map reading exercises are held, and members are encouraged to familiarize themselves with alternate routes to common destinations. By diligently managing navigation data, FPA ensures that no one is ever truly “lost” – they have the tools and knowledge to find their way or find each other, no matter the conditions.
