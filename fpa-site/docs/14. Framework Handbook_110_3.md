|**Tier 4** – Community Support Assets|Group-level resources to support the broader community’s response and recovery.|High-capacity water filtration (to serve a neighborhood); large communal shelter tents or canopies; tools for debris removal (chainsaws, heavy-duty jacks); bulk cooking equipment (field kitchen gear); communications infrastructure (radio repeaters, perhaps a satellite phone); transportation (maybe a shared 4x4 truck or boat if relevant); stockpile of community aid supplies (blankets, clothes, fuel reserves).|**Goal:** Enable an FPA chapter or alliance of squads to assist not just themselves but also neighbors and public efforts. Tier 4 items are often owned collectively by a chapter rather than individuals. Mk1Mod3 encourages chapters to identify a few key community assets to acquire or arrange (often via grants, donations, or partnerships). It’s about extending help outward – effectively acting as a local resilience hub.|  
These gear tiers guide members on where to focus. New members start with Tier 1 basics. Once that’s solid, they gradually build Tier 2 for home. Tier 3 is an advanced endeavor and not required for everyone – it often coincides with higher ORP levels. Tier 4 is typically handled at the chapter level.
