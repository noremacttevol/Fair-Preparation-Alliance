**Description:** With funding in hand and lessons from the pilot, roll out Outernet receiver stations to all FPA regions (and ideally to multiple squads within each region). This milestone involves the physical distribution of equipment, installation in each area, and integration of the satellite feed into everyday FPA operations. Essentially, we move from a single-region test to a nation-wide capability, ensuring that any region hit by disaster can receive broadcast info even if cut off from the internet.
**Real-World Example:** By late 2026, FPA had placed at least one Outernet receiver in each of the 10 regions. When a massive winter storm knocked out power across New England, the Region I relay squad in Boston continued to get updates on the evolving situation via satellite – including NOAA weather forecasts and a list of emergency warming centers. They relayed these to local squads in Maine and Vermont over HAM. Meanwhile, down south, during the same week, Gulf Coast teams were downloading a scheduled first-aid training file from the Outernet, showing the system’s versatility coast-to-coast.
