**Core Coordination** is the first of our five content families, and it is the beating heart of FPA’s day-to-day and strategic operations. If FPA were a living body, Core Coordination is the **central nervous system** – receiving information from all limbs, making decisions, and sending out commands to get things done. This content family encompasses leadership structures, operational planning, resource allocation, and inter-departmental communication. It’s all about **keeping the Alliance aligned and effective** in real time. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what Core Coordination entails:  
- **Strategic Planning & Mission Design:** Core Coordination handles the big picture. This team (or set of processes) translates the Alliance’s mission into concrete plans. They set the objectives for phases and make sure every content family knows its part. For example, Core Coordination drafts the annual strategic overview (like this very Master Compass Mk1Mod3 you’re reading) and updates it as situations change. They constantly ask: _What’s our next priority? Is it training more medic volunteers in Region3? Is it stockpiling fuel before winter? Is it lobbying local authorities for support?_ Then they hammer out **mission plans** and campaign orders to achieve those goals. During a crisis, Core Coordination becomes the war room – evaluating intel from Tech, readiness status from Drills, comms reports from Outreach, and so on, then rapidly forming a coherent response plan.
