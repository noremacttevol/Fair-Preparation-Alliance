**Contingency Plan:** If one network goes down (say satellites are offline due to a solar storm), the protocol should dictate that HAM takes over all comms – meaning relay squads then verbally disseminate everything, even things normally sent as PDFs or data. They should have the authority to summarize and broadcast vital info if Outernet is out. If, conversely, radio is severely limited (spectrum jam or widespread equipment loss), lean on Outernet to carry more weight: increase broadcast frequency, include detailed instructions for those who can receive, and potentially use non-ham means like community bulletin boards to share printouts from Outernet. In essence, each part is backup for the other. If both are operational but integration fails (e.g., a liaison forgot to forward something), implement redundancy by having multiple eyes – perhaps Content Team also checks a public disaster info feed and might catch something even if a radio operator forgets. And as always, document any misses to refine training – the goal is a culture where radio and Outernet are just two faces of the same coin for FPA, not competing channels.
