_Phase 3_ is the **visionary end-state** of the FPA user journey: a fully mature network (scaling past 50k+ members) where local squads largely **self-manage** and the system sustains itself through community-driven processes with minimal central intervention. Technology (AI and the app) still plays a crucial role, but more as an enabler and coordinator rather than a controller. The focus here is on **decentralization, resilience, and community governance** – fulfilling the FPA’s mission to be a national alliance that can operate even under extreme conditions or large scale.  
- **Peer-Led Onboarding & Recruitment:** In Phase3, the new user application flow can lean heavily on the community:  
- **Referral & Sponsorship:** A growing portion of new applicants may come through existing members. The application form includes a “Referred by” field, and a referral might fast-track an application (e.g., if a trusted member vouches for the newcomer, the AI could auto-mark it Green). Squads could even have invite links or codes to onboard people they meet during events. The culture by now encourages members to **“bring a friend”** – effectively decentralizing recruitment.
