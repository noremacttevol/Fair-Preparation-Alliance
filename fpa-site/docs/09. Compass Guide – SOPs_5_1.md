- **Chapters/Regions:** Several squads in a geographic area make up a **region**, sometimes referred to as a local chapter if they operate jointly. For example, all squads in one county or city might collectively form the FPA Chapter for that area. Among them, they’ll have a **Regional Coordinator** or chapter lead (an experienced member, often around the rank of E-7, see ranks below) who facilitates communication across squads. The region level organizes larger training events, helps redistribute resources where needed, and ensures that if one squad is hit hard by a disaster, neighboring squads come to help. The key is **regional coherence** – squads remain mostly autonomous for local matters, but they cooperate at the regional level for bigger efforts.
