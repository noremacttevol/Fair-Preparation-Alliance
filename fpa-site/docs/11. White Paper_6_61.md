- _Contingency Plan:_ If buying radios is not feasible immediately, improvise – sometimes older kids’ walkie-talkies or borrowed units can be gathered short-term. In worst case, fallback on whistles or runners as described, but keep radio acquisition on your priority fundraising list. If radio interference or overcrowded channels become a problem (common in dense areas), coordinate with neighbors or switch channels. Emphasize radio discipline – misuse or overuse will cause people to turn them off. Also, mind legalities: don’t transmit on ham frequencies without a license (listening is fine, though). As soon as resources allow, implement this milestone because it underpins many others (you’ll see communications threads in integration, tech, scalability all link back to having a working squad radio network).
