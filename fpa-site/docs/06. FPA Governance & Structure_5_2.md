- **No Private Monopoly, No Sell-Outs:** Our governance rules forbid any leader or member from privatizing alliance assets for personal gain. You can’t take the FPA training curriculum and sell it under your own name, for instance. If you leave the alliance, you don’t get to take a piece of its core IP with you – it stays with FPA (which ultimately belongs to all members as a collective). This is important for trust: members contribute ideas and work knowing it won’t be hijacked by someone looking to get rich. It’s also a protection against external buyout: if some corporation or government agency tried to co-opt the FPA by buying our tech, they’d hit a wall, because the IP is held in stewardship for the mission, not for sale. We’d sooner give something away free to the public domain (for the good of all preppers) than sell exclusive rights to a bidder who might restrict its use. Our alliance’s knowledge is our lifeline, and we treat it that way.
