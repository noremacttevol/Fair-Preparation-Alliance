leaders know each other, they might calmly split the contents rather than have a standoff. The alliance network thus acts as a deconfliction mechanism. Scaling Up Response: If an emergency is larger than FPA alone can handle (say a whole town is devastated), an alliance of multiple groups pooling efforts can create an effective ad-hoc civilian response force. One group’s medics, another’s cooks, another’s drivers, coordinated loosely through leader meetings, can cover more ground. FPA is open to such joint operations when lives are at stake. They may even establish a joint operations center (even if it’s a shared radio channel or daily meetup of group reps) to synchronize efforts for the broader community. Post-Crisis Community Building: In Phase 3, these alliances may formalize into coalitions aimed at rebuilding. FPA might take a leadership or advisory role in a “community preparedness task force” composed of various local groups that emerged. This sets the stage for a more resilient community thereafter. Limitations and Cautions: FPA will avoid alliances that threaten their core values or security. For instance, they’d be wary of aligning with any extremist militia or political group whose aims differ (to avoid guilt by association or internal division). They’ll also be cautious about alliances with heavy government oversight – they wouldn’t, for example, register their members on a government list in exchange for some help; the alliance stops short of exposing themselves
