Pilot Programs and Demonstrations: Feasibility will be proven through pilot implementations. FPA might choose a few communities to serve as “model FPA communities.” In these pilots, FPA can work with local emergency management and residents to set up its full program – training, resource stockpiles, communications network, mutual aid agreements. By handling a small crisis or even an organized drill, these pilots can showcase how FPA operates and refine the model. Success stories (e.g. an FPA team responding to a neighborhood after a tornado before outside help arrived) will be powerful for scaling up. This approach mirrors how new response concepts are often tested – for instance, the CERT program itself started in 1985 in Los Angeles and proved its usefulness in earthquakes before spreading nationally in 1993. FPA can similarly incubate in disaster-prone or receptive areas first.
