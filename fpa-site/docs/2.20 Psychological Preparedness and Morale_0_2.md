Communication: Regularly communicating updates and plans to all members helps reduce fear of the unknown. Even if news is bad, hearing it and knowing leadership has a plan is better than silence. They avoid rumors and address fears openly (“Yes, the situation is tough, but here’s what we’re doing and what we still have going for us.”).  
Unity and Purpose: Emphasizing the shared mission – “We’re all in this together and we will get through it together” – fosters group cohesion which boosts morale. Members are reminded that their efforts are meaningful: guarding tonight isn’t just drudgery, it’s protecting our families; hauling water isn’t just labor, it’s keeping everyone alive. This sense of purpose wards off despair.  
Routines and Roles: Establishing daily routines (meal times, guard rotations, group check-ins) and clear roles gives a sense of normalcy and control in chaos. People feel better when they know what to do and can contribute. Even small duties like tending a fire or leading a prayer can anchor someone.
