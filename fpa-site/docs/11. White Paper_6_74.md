- _Action Steps:_  
- Identify potential funding sources: local government emergency preparedness grants (some cities/counties have mini-grants for neighborhood resiliency), charitable foundations (community foundations, Rotary clubs, etc.), corporate social responsibility programs (businesses might sponsor community safety projects), and of course crowdfunding or local fundraising events.  
- Assign someone or a small sub-team to focus on fundraising. They can start with simple tasks: write a one-page description of the squad and its needs (this will be useful for grant applications or donor letters).  
- For grants: search online for terms like “community resilience grant [Your State]” or “neighborhood improvement grant.” Even $500 can be a boon. When applying, be concrete: e.g., “We seek $1,000 to purchase 10 emergency radios and first aid supplies for a volunteer-led disaster response team in a high-risk, low-income neighborhood.” Back it up with a brief description of your activities to date. Use any data or references you have (e.g., “FEMA recommends community prep; our approach aligns with national CERT program ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=The%20CERT%20program%20offers%20a,focus%20on%20more%20complex%20tasks))”).
