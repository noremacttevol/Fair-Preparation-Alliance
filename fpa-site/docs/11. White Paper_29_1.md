**Real-World Example:** After Phase 3 initiatives had been in place for a while, the 2028 FPA Convention was convened. Representatives from every region (largely the National Council plus additional delegates) gathered both in-person and virtually. They reviewed a slate of amendments: one added an Outernet usage policy to the Trust Doctrine (ensuring open access to information), another refined the volunteer code of conduct based on incident reports, and another formalized the political neutrality clause given some new partisan pressures seen. An AI tool had pre-scanned the proposals, flagging one that inadvertently contradicted an earlier principle about local autonomy. Delegates debated and revised accordingly. The updated Charter and Doctrine were then ratified by an all-squad vote. This process, repeated biennially, became a cornerstone of FPA’s governance – demonstrating that unlike some institutions that calcify, FPA learns and self-corrects over time, guided by its members’ collective wisdom and a little AI assistance to keep things coherent.
