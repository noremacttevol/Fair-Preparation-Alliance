- **Public Acknowledgment and Thanks:** A vital part of communications after a crisis is thanking those involved – volunteers, partner agencies, even the public for their cooperation. FPA makes a point to celebrate the **local heroes and community spirit**. We’ll do posts or newsletter features: “How the Franklin County FPA Squad and local firefighters worked together during the wildfire” or a short video of community members expressing how FPA’s guidance helped them. Not for vanity, but to reinforce the _model_: show others that this decentralized, citizen-led approach really works. It also deepens trust – people see that we don’t take credit alone, we give credit. And it boosts morale; volunteers feel appreciated and motivated to stay involved.
