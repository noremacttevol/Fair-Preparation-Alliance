- Set up an international liaison team within FPA to handle communications, time zone coordination, and cultural advice for global partners.  
- Establish a simple onboarding process: e.g., new country squads operate under a provisional “FPA affiliate” status until they craft their own Trust Doctrine aligned with ours.  
- Create an online forum (with offline digest via Outernet) where domestic and international FPA members can exchange tips and support, building a global community from day one.
**Contingency Plan:** If initial interest abroad is low, focus on quality of a few pilot international squads rather than quantity. Political barriers (like a country suspicious of foreign ties) can be mitigated by having that country’s FPA branch use a local name and simply share principles informally. Ensure that if global expansion slows, it doesn’t detract from national strength – the global team operates as a support unit and doesn’t drain resources from ongoing domestic efforts.
