All these data inputs are aggregated and managed in the system’s **Knowledge Management** backend. Essentially, each member builds a digital _transcript_ of their preparedness training: quiz scores, drill records, plan evaluations, etc. The Skill Wheel is the front-end visualization of that transcript. The backend will apply weighting rules to combine these inputs into the segment percentages. For example, within a given category we might decide that quizzes can contribute up to, say, 30% of the segment, hands-on drills up to 50%, and real-world experience up to 20%. This would ensure that hands-on skills carry the most weight in the long run. The exact weighting schema will be determined in the detailed design phase (and will likely be documented in an internal design reference, such as the SHTF Bible’s design appendix or training manual, to maintain transparency).
