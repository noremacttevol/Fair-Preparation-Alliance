Training is the backbone of FPA’s effectiveness. The Alliance runs a continuous Skills Development Program to ensure all members are competent in key areas and that specialized skills are distributed across the network. Early in Phase 1, each member’s skills and gaps are identified (recorded in the [[Member Skills Directory]]). From there, FPA encourages a structured learning path. Core Training Modules: Every member is expected to attain proficiency in a core set of skills. These typically include first aid and trauma care (from basic CPR to wound management), land navigation with map and compass (in case GPS fails), radio communication basics (operating a ham/FRS radio properly, using proper net etiquette as per [[Ham Radio Network]] practices), fire-starting and basic shelter building (for wilderness survival), water purification methods, and basic self-defense techniques. FPA often conducts workshops or courses on these topics, sometimes taught by members with expertise (a member who’s an EMT might teach first aid, a military veteran might teach land nav and defense). Advanced/Specialized Training: Members also pursue areas of personal strength or interest that benefit the group. For instance, some may train in advanced radio operations (learning to set up field antennas or packet radio for Realnet nodes), some in gardening/agriculture (for long-term food security, which they share knowledge about), others in mechanical repair or electrical systems (to maintain
