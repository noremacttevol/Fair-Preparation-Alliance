**Phase1** is where we **set the foundation** using minimal automation and maximal human coordination. At this stage, FPA runs on human effort, simple tools, and old-fashioned grit. We **don’t rely on advanced tech** here – assuming it might not be available when SHTF. Consider Phase1 the “basics-first” approach, ensuring everyone can operate even if the power’s out and the internet’s gone.  
- **Bootstrapping the Network:** In Phase1, the alliance grows through word-of-mouth, meetups, and basic communication channels. We establish regional chapters and local squads using whatever is on hand – phone trees, HAM radios, in-person meetings. Every member is expected to **learn to operate with paper maps, analog tools, and face-to-face coordination**. Digital convenience is a luxury we don’t assume.  
- **Training & SHTF Manual:** Core skills are drilled manually. Members study and carry the **SHTF Manual** (our “in case of emergency, break glass” guide) and build competency through regular hands-on drills. Think basic first aid, land navigation without GPS, fireteam tactics for community defense, and **contested environment operations** where resources are scarce and danger is real. Nothing is taken for granted – we practice everything as if the grid is down and help isn’t coming.
