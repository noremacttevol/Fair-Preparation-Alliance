The FPA App is essentially the digital hub for members. Key features include:  
- **Secure Messaging & Alerts:** Members can communicate via text or voice messages within their squad or chapter. Think of it as a secure group chat that can fall back to peer-to-peer mode when no internet is available (leveraging the mesh network from Chapter 8). Important alerts (weather warnings, evacuation orders, etc.) are distributed as push notifications when online, or stored and relayed via other members when offline.  
- **Resource Sharing & Tracking:** The app has a section for inventories. Squads can log their critical supplies (aggregated to respect privacy) – this helps identify shortages or surplus in the network. If Squad A has extra chainsaws and Squad B needs one, a lookup shows who can help. During an incident, members can request resources or help through the app (e.g., “Need a generator on 5th Street”); nearby squads get notified to respond.  
- **Training and Drills:** The app hosts training modules (videos, quizzes, interactive guides) which members use for their Operational Readiness progression (Chapter 6). It tracks completed courses, certifications (like first aid, ham license), and upcoming training events. It can also simulate scenarios for practice – e.g., a “Disaster Simulator” that presents challenges and times your responses, making learning interactive.
