Operational Readiness Progression isn’t just an internal program; it has positive ripple effects:  
- Members at Level 1 or 2 are far better prepared than the average citizen, which means in a disaster they likely won’t be dependent on strained public emergency services – instead, they might be helping neighbors. This reduces the overall burden on the community.  
- As members reach Level 3 and 4, they often become community leaders in resilience. It’s not uncommon for a Level 4 FPA member to end up on a city emergency planning commission or to lead a local volunteer fire brigade. The skills and confidence gained through ORP empower individuals to contribute beyond FPA’s scope.  
- The progression fosters a culture of continual learning in the alliance. It keeps complacency at bay. Even highly prepared folks find there’s always something new to learn or practice (for example, learning sign language to communicate in noisy environments or with hearing-impaired neighbors could be an elective advanced skill).
