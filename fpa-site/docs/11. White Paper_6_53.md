20. **Milestone 20: Implement a Community Communication Hub (Info Board or Outpost)**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A creative squad set up a community bulletin board in front of a member’s house, protected by a simple awning. In daily life it showed preparedness tips and upcoming drills. During a prolonged power outage, it became the go-to information hub where they posted updates (e.g., “Water truck at 5th and Elm at 3 PM” or “Charge your phone at squad base 2-4 PM”). Neighbors called it their “low-tech Facebook.” Meanwhile, a village squad without many resources designated a specific wall in the local market as the spot for notices pre- and post-disaster. Everyone knew to check that spot if communications were down. These hubs significantly improved community awareness and reduced panic since people had a reliable place to find or leave information.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ In disasters, **information is as critical as food and water**. A prepared squad should facilitate info-sharing for the broader community, not just among themselves. This is an extension of empowerment and transparency – arming the public with knowledge. **Lesson:** Plan for a scenario with no phones or internet: how will locals know what’s happening or where to go? The squad can fill this void with an analog solution like a bulletin board, chalkboard, or staffed info table. It’s old-fashioned, but when high-tech fails, low-tech shines.
