and Education]] note – for example, using an AI-based quiz system for members to test their knowledge on medical procedures or using scenario simulations to test decision-making. However, FPA ensures AI is an aid, not a crutch (members still practice hands-on). Training Materials: FPA’s knowledge management provides abundant resources – e.g., chapters from the SHTF Bible on various skills are assigned as reading. The Alliance also curates external resources (like CERT manuals, military survival guide excerpts, ham radio study guides) and makes them available. Some members pursue official certifications (CERT, amateur radio license, Wilderness First Responder, etc.) during Phase 1 for personal achievement and then share that knowledge. Progression and Assessment: To maintain standards, FPA does periodic assessments. For example, every six months a chapter might organize a skill assessment day – run through first aid scenarios, target practice at the range (if applicable and legal), and a short navigation course. Weaknesses are noted and extra training sessions arranged. The atmosphere is supportive – the goal is improvement, not punishment. Knowledge Sharing Culture: Members are encouraged to teach what they learn. If someone attends an external course (like a permaculture workshop or an advanced firearm tactics class), they return and present key lessons to the group. This multiplies expertise without everyone attending everything. Phase 2 Adaptation: During crisis, training
