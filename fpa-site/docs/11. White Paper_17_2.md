- Establish a daily content cycle: e.g., by 5 PM each day, the team locks down what will be broadcast overnight. In crisis mode, switch to an as-needed “clear and send” approach for urgent messages.  
- Interface with authoritative sources: set up feeds or contacts with NOAA for weather, USGS for earthquakes, FEMA for public info, etc., so the team can grab the latest verified data. Also use FPA’s internal intel – e.g., region relay squads might report local needs which the team can then amplify to others.  
- Create a lightweight vetting checklist for any user-generated or third-party info: check authenticity, relevance to FPA, brevity. The team should err on the side of factual, actionable info over noise.  
- Develop templates to speed up production: e.g., a blank “daily report” template where they just fill in numbers, a standard way to format a shelter list or a missing persons report. This consistency also makes it easier for receivers to read and parse quickly.  
- Train the Content Team on the upload process: how to compress files, avoid large images (maybe use text-only or very small images), and how to trigger the satellite uplink. Have multiple members practice so it’s not reliant on one tech guru.
