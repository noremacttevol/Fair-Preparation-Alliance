to ward off intruders without immediate resort to lethal force. They stock items like heavy-duty pepper gel, stun devices, or even paintball guns with pepper balls for area denial at closer ranges. Convoy and Travel Security: When members must move (bug out convoys, supply runs), they plan routes with security in mind. Typically, at least two vehicles travel together; members are armed (if legal/necessary) and maintain communication between vehicles. They have plans for ambushes – e.g., not entering choke points blindly, having scouts or using ham radio to get intel on road conditions. If a convoy is large, they’ll put a capable driver at front and back (in case of blockade, the lead can push through or the rear can cover retreat). Camouflage and Stealth: Sometimes the best defense is not being noticed. FPA trains in basic fieldcraft: using natural cover for camps, noise and light discipline at night, and not wearing anything that screams “I have supplies.” Vehicles might be mud-smeared or look less appealing intentionally. Community Integration: Another aspect of physical security is working with non-member neighbors when possible. If the whole neighborhood bands together, it’s safer for all. FPA members often try to quietly encourage neighbors to form a watch or share simple signals (“we’ll hang a red cloth if we see suspicious people”). This not only spreads the work of security but also helps avoid an “us versus them” scenario locally. However, sensitive info (like
