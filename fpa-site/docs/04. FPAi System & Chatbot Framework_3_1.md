- **Local Offline Mode:** The FPA mobile app keeps critical data stored _on your device_ so that FPAi can still function in a limited capacity without internet ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=philosophical%20questions,work\)%20tool/)). For example, your personal emergency plan, key contact lists, the FPA Dictionary, and essential chapters of the _SHTF Bible_ are cached locally ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=philosophical%20questions,work\)%20tool/)) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=emergency%20app,%20user%20experience%20can,by%20how%20disaster%20radios%20work/)). If you lose connectivity, you can still ask FPAi questions that it can answer from the offline data (like first aid steps or purification methods). This means even off-grid, you have a library of survival knowledge at your fingertips, searchable by the AI. The app also prototypes peer-to-peer features: it can use Bluetooth or local radio mesh networking to share messages and data with nearby members if the internet is cut ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=emergency%20app,%20user%20experience%20can,by%20how%20disaster%20radios%20work/)). In other words, even if the wider network is down, FPAi can form an “offline network” with any other devices in range to keep information flowing.
