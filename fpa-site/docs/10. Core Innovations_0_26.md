**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** Next up, we aim to broaden participation and shore up our solar infrastructure. In the coming month: (a) Launch the **“Solar Ambassador” training – 30 members (at least one per chapter) will go through a crash course on solar installation and troubleshooting, empowering them to lead local projects and workshops. (b) Implement a **Solar Swap Program**: members who upgraded their home systems are encouraged to donate older but working panels and batteries to others (FPA will coordinate collection and redistribution, ensuring even those with limited means can get a starter setup). (c) Conduct stress tests: we plan a 48-hour simulation in which certain squads operate entirely off-grid using solar for power, to gather data and improve our usage strategies (e.g., rationing power for critical devices at night). Additionally, we’ll finalize an **Off-Grid Power SOP** that combines generator usage with solar best practices for hybrid approaches. By day 30, we expect to have at least 50 new households set up with basic solar rigs through FPA guidance, and an inventory of solar gear in our cache system for emergency deployment. The Solar Resilience Program will continuously expand – today panels on safehouses and personal kits, tomorrow perhaps community microgrids. It’s all about giving the Alliance lasting power.
