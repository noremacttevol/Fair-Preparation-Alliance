- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** SOPs are the concrete “how-to” guides for various tasks and roles in FPA (for example, how to set up a field radio station, how to perform triage, etc.). We anticipate a two-way linkage between SOPs and the Skill Wheel. **First**, some Skill Wheel requirements will be directly tied to SOP completion. For instance, to reach 50% in Survivalcraft, you might need to demonstrate the SOP for emergency fire shelter deployment. In this way, the Skill Wheel actively encourages members to _practice SOPs_, not just read them. **Second**, the wheel can help identify members qualified for certain roles as defined by SOPs. For example, if there’s an SOP for “Squad Communications Officer,” we can map what skills are needed (say 70%+ in Comms, 50%+ in Navigation for setting up relays, etc.). Then, by looking at Skill Wheels, leaders can quickly see who meets those qualifications. During mission planning or emergency deployment, this is a quick reference: _“Who can handle medical triage right now? Let’s check wheels… Alice has 80% First Aid – she’s our best candidate.”_ In implementation, we will coordinate closely with the SOP development team so that the skill categories and metrics align naturally with SOP requirements.
