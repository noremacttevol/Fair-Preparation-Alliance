- _Contingency Plan:_ If writing isn’t a strength in the team, even voice memos or video logs of meetings can serve as documentation, which someone can later transcribe or summarize. The key is not to rely solely on the memory of founding members; that knowledge must outlive their direct involvement. If pressed for time, focus on critical procedures first (life-saving tasks, communications protocols) and do the nice-to-haves later. Also consider security: don’t document sensitive personal data or vulnerabilities in a publicly accessible file. Keep operational documents somewhat guarded within the team. But things like after-action lessons can be sanitized and shared publicly or with FPA central to contribute to overall improvement.
