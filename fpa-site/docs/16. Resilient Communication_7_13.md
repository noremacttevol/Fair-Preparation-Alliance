- **Fleet & Infrastructure Management:** Phase 4 might oversee physical infrastructure like any Alliance-owned repeaters, storage bunkers for comms gear, or the mobile units inventory across regions. They set maintenance schedules, redundancy plans (ensuring, say, that if one regional repeater goes down, another can cover or mobile units can be deployed). Essentially, they manage the Alliance’s “communication assets” at the macro level.  
- **Mentorship and Inspections:** Senior members at this phase go around (physically or virtually) to chapters to mentor Phase 2 and 3 personnel. They may conduct readiness inspections: checking that squads have the required gear and that members can perform their comms tasks. This ensures consistency – one squad’s “radio check” drill results can be compared to another’s, raising overall standards by cross-pollination of best practices.
