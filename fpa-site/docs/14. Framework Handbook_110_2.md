|**Tier 3** – Long-term/Off-Grid (1–3+ Months)|Long-duration crises or partial societal collapse scenarios, requiring greater self-reliance.|Advanced water solutions (rainwater catchment, high-capacity gravity filters); food production/storage (garden seeds, canning supplies, dehydrated bulk foods for months); larger fuel reserves; more substantial solar power setup (panels, inverter, battery bank); advanced medical supplies (sutures, antibiotics if obtainable); HAM radio set with antenna (for long-range comms); defensive tools (if appropriate & legal); repair tools and materials (tarps, plywood, nails for patching roofs, etc.).|**Goal:** Equip a household or small group to survive multiple months with minimal outside aid. Tier 3 overlaps with sustainable living – often requiring skills to use the gear effectively (e.g., gardening). It’s costly and usually a collective effort (squad members might share some items like one has a deep freezer, another a large generator). Many Level 3 members work on this tier over time.|
