A: It’s a delicate balance between OPSEC and outreach. FPA wants to grow its network but also protect sensitive info. The approach is usually layered: public vs private. Publicly, FPA (or local chapters) might put out general preparedness content, run workshops, or maintain a website that explains their mission in broad terms – this attracts interested people without exposing member identities or caches. When someone shows interest, there’s likely a vetting process: they might be invited to a casual meetup or workshop first (nothing too sensitive shared) so members can get a read on them. If that goes well and they seem trustworthy and values-aligned, they’re gradually brought deeper – maybe invited to a members-only training or given access to certain resources. It’s similar to how a trust-building handshake works: new folks get some initial trust but have to reciprocate (show commitment, share about themselves) to move further in. FPA might use a referral system – existing members vouch for newcomers – rather than mass advertising. Online, they might moderate forums or social media groups where they share tips and quietly identify serious participants who could be recruited. The Trust Doctrine likely guides this: you don’t spill alliance secrets to outsiders, but you do share the spirit of FPA to attract the right people. Once someone joins, they’re taught OPSEC too, so the cycle continues. Essentially, FPA grows like a tree: open, visible branches offering shade
