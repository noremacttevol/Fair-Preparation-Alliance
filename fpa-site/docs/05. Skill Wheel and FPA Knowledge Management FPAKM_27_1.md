This strategic plan has detailed how the system will function and grow through **three phases**: starting from simple, human-verified assessments in Phase1, advancing through digital integration in Phase2, and eventually reaching smart automation and widespread adoption in Phase3. At each step, we have been careful to ground the plan in FPA’s core values and existing doctrines. Technology serves our people – never the other way around. We would rather have a low-tech solution that members trust and use, than a fancy high-tech system that alienates or confuses. Fortunately, by following our phased approach, we can have the best of both: introduce the concepts in low-tech ways to build trust, then add tech muscle once the concept is proven and embraced.
