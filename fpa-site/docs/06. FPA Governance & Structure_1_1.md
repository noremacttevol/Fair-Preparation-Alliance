- **Civic Resilience First:** The FPA is all about strengthening communities to withstand disasters and “SHTF” scenarios (when the **S**t **H**its **T**he **F**an). Our governance is designed to serve that mission – **not** to serve egos or profit. Every policy and structure must answer one question: _Does this help people fare better in a crisis?_ If not, we don’t do it. We prioritize practical resilience: shared knowledge, mutual aid, and prepping that’s fair and accessible. Our alliance is part of the civic fabric, working alongside neighborhoods and first responders, not a remote bureaucracy. We plan for worst-case scenarios so that society’s fabric holds strong, **fairly distributing burdens and skills** rather than letting the vulnerable fall through the cracks.
