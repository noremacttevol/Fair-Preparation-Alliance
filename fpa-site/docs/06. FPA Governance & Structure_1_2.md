- **Transparent, Role-Based Authority:** In FPA, authority isn’t a perk of status – it’s a responsibility tied to a **clearly defined role**. All leadership roles, decision-making powers, and responsibilities are explicitly documented and visible to all members. If someone has the mandate to organize a regional drill or manage funds, everyone knows why and for how long. There are no secret power brokers or ambiguous titles. This transparency builds trust: you don’t have to wonder who’s really in charge of what, because it’s out in the open. It also means anyone can challenge or question a decision _based on the agreed role definitions_. We hold **people accountable to their roles**, not to arbitrary orders. In short, _if it’s not in your job description, you can’t pull rank about it._ And if it _is_, you should be ready to explain your decisions to the group.
