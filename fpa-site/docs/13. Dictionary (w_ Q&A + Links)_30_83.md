A: In a multi-region disaster (say a massive earthquake spanning states or a blackout over a grid region), FPA teams coordinate by first managing their local response and then linking up regionally through pre-set communication channels. Each local chapter will assess their status (casualties, damage, needs) and then reach out via ham radio or satellite to neighboring chapters or the national coordination team. FPA likely has a tiered comm plan: local nets feed into a regional net. For instance, chapters in a state report to a state coordinator, who then passes a summary to a national coordinator. These reports include what assistance is needed or can be offered. If one area is hit harder, nearby FPA groups might mobilize volunteers and resources to assist (like mutual aid fire departments do). They arrange safe corridors for travel if possible, or at least send knowledge (e.g., “the river bridge on Route 5 is out, use Route 7”). They might designate a physical meeting location at the edge of the affected zone as a staging area. Shared documents like maps and contact lists are pulled from their knowledge base, as likely planned. Flexibility is key: if phones work between some regions, use them; if not, rely on radio relay. Cross-region coordination also means avoiding duplicated effort or gaps – FPA might use something like an incident command system informally to assign tasks (food distribution by one cell, medical camp by another, etc.). Because it’s multi-region, help
