A critical distinction in FPAâ€™s strategy is that we are not content with having a large number of passive followers or subscribers. The true metric of success is how many **active interpreters** of FPA doctrine we cultivate. An _interpreter_, in our terminology, is someone who deeply understands the principles and can apply and communicate them independently, especially under adverse conditions (like grid-down scenarios). This section outlines how we nurture such individuals and why they are so important.
