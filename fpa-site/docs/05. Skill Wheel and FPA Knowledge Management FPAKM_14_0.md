Ultimately, every member will maintain an **offline readiness packet** (sometimes called a “go-binder” in preparedness circles). We envision the packet containing several components, which the Skill Wheel system will help compile and update:  
- **Emergency Info Cover Page:** The member’s vital info like emergency contacts, call sign, blood type, allergies, etc. (This is standard personal preparedness info and may be managed outside of our system, but it would be included for completeness.)  
- **Skill Wheel Summary:** A printout of the member’s Skill Wheel – possibly as the graphic itself or a simple table listing their skill percentages. This allows, for instance, team members to quickly assess each other’s capabilities if they convene during an emergency (“Who’s our strongest medic here?” can be answered by a glance at these sheets).  
- **Personal Skill Card/Pages:** The individualized skill summary and tips described above, with tailored advice, quick guides, and checklists.  
- **Key SHTF Bible Excerpts:** Crucial pages from the SHTF Bible relevant to that member’s context. For example, a coastal member’s packet might include a printed section on hurricane preparedness and flood response. A member in a wildfire zone might have the wildfire chapter. This ensures that, even if they can’t carry the entire manual, they have the most pertinent instructions on hand.
