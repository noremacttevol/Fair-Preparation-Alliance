- **Skill Development via the Skill Wheel:** The FPA **Skill Wheel** is a visual tracker of your survival competencies (e.g. First Aid, Communications, Navigation, Survivalcraft). FPAi integrates with this system to help you grow a well-rounded skill set. As you log training or pass skill assessments, your Skill Wheel fills up in each category, showing your progress ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=visual%20representation:%20imagine%20a%20circle,chart%20for%20skill%20mastery/)) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=filling%20in%20quarters:%20progress%20in,training%20and%20demonstrating%20it%20could/)). FPAi uses this info to give tailored guidance – if it sees a weak area on your wheel, it can prompt you with tips or training resources to improve that segment ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=maintain%20skill%20wheels%20&%20squad,track%20real%20drills,%20verify%20progress/)). For example, if your First Aid quarter is mostly empty, FPAi might suggest a first aid course or quiz next. The AI essentially “knows” your skill profile and will encourage balanced development. This adaptive approach keeps you from focusing only on your favorite skills; a lopsided wheel (say, great radio comms but poor medical skills) is immediately visible and FPAi will gently push you to shore up those weak spots
