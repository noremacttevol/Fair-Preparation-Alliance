Throughout the officer track, **Alliance Points continue to accumulate** from leadership activities, but promotions are more heavily dependent on **validation (votes/approvals)** and the successful completion of mission objectives, rather than predefined “tasks” like in enlisted ranks. An officer must demonstrate results: e.g., a Regional Officer (O-5) should have run multiple successful regional exercises, increased membership in their region, or improved readiness metrics, before moving up to Regional Director (O-6).
