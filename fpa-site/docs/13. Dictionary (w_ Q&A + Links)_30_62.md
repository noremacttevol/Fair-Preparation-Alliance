A: FPA sees foraging and hunting as useful survival skills, especially in prolonged disruptions, but they come with cautions and context. The alliance likely encourages members to learn local foraging – knowing which wild plants are edible or medicinal in their region – as a backup food source if stores run empty and personal stockpiles dwindle. Hunting and fishing skills are also valued for the same reason. However, FPA would stress that these are supplemental and scenario-dependent. In a short-term crisis, you’re better off eating stored food than spending energy hunting. But in a long-term “grid-down” or TEOTWAWKI, these skills could become crucial. They’d teach ethical and legal considerations too: in normal times or limited disasters, don’t break game laws unless it’s life or death; respect nature and don’t over-harvest. FPA might even organize skill-building outings like guided foraging walks or wilderness survival weekends to practice these skills safely. They also highlight that in a widespread disaster, many others may also try foraging/hunting, quickly depleting resources near populated areas – hence the emphasis remains on prepping food in advance. Safety is underscored: don’t eat mushrooms or plants unless you’re sure, don’t hunt without knowing how to do it humanely and handle a weapon safely, etc. Also, things like fishing kits in bug-out bags are common FPA tips. So the stance: positive as part of a skill set (the more self-reliant, the better), but realistic
