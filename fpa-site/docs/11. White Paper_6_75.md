- For local fundraising: consider a dual-purpose event (a bake sale where you also distribute preparedness flyers, or a film screening of a documentary about disasters followed by a discussion). Sell a small product if appropriate (even homemade emergency car kits assembled by the squad). Alternatively, do a “sponsor a supply” drive: put up a public list, “We need X, costs $Y” and see if folks chip in for specific items.  
- Track and manage funds transparently. Keep receipts and a ledger. If the squad isn’t a formal non-profit, designate a trusted treasurer and possibly keep funds in a dedicated bank account or a cash box for full visibility. Report back to donors/grantors with what you achieved (this also sets you up nicely to ask again later, as you build credibility by delivering results).
