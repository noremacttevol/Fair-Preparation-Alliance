The Compass Guide isn’t meant to be read once and forgotten. It’s a document to live by. In calm times, it might just seem like common sense guidelines; in crisis times, it becomes the voice in your head reminding you why we do what we do. When the pressure is on – maybe resources are scant, or fear and rumors are running wild – that’s when you’ll lean on these principles and explanations the most. They will help you make the hard calls: choosing cooperation over selfishness, action over paralysis, and fact over fiction.  
By joining the FPA, you’ve agreed to uphold a certain standard. The Compass Guide is the contract of that standard. If you ever find yourself or a fellow member drifting off-course, come back here, find the relevant section, and regain your bearing. The beauty of having this written down is that it removes ambiguity and debate over “the right thing to do” in the FPA – we’ve thought it through, we’ve learned from others’ mistakes, and this is our collective wisdom.  
Lastly, remember that the Compass Guide, like everything in FPA, is a _living document_. It can be refined. As you gain experience, you might have insights that make their way into the next edition. In that sense, every member is an author of our alliance’s story and its rules. Stay committed, stay curious, and never hesitate to ask “why?” – because that question is the reason this guide exists.
