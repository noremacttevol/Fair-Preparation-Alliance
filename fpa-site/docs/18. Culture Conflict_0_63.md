Defined Channels for Voice: In addition to the conflict-reporting methods described, we have routine ways for anyone to voice ideas or concerns. For instance, an “Alliance Suggestions” forum (monitored by the Governance team) allows posting proposals or critiques of any aspect of FPA. These might be minor (“Can we clarify the travel reimbursement policy?”) to major (“I feel our Alliance is straying from its original mission in this way…”). Each submission gets a considered response. By having this, we signal that speaking up is not just allowed, but welcomed. It’s far better for someone to raise a concern on an official channel than to quietly withdraw or gossip. Even if a suggestion isn’t adopted, it’s acknowledged. The presence of these channels makes honesty a norm – people don’t have to whisper in corners; they can speak on the record.
