- **AI as a Squad Co-Pilot:** Each squad effectively has an AI helper integrated. [[FPAi]] might have a mode or “avatar” dedicated to squad support. For example, the AI can:  
- Remind squads of upcoming tasks ( “Your quarterly drill is due next week; here are three scenario ideas.” ).  
- Analyze squad data to highlight gaps (“Team, none of you have a water purification device listed. Consider addressing this.”) – essentially performing the plan review role at squad level.  
- Mediate conflicts or questions via the **Truth Arbitration Protocol (TAP)** if disagreements arise (for instance, if there’s a dispute about a safety practice, the AI can provide an objective recommendation based on FPA doctrine, which the squad can accept or override through a council) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=squad%20roster%20with%20backups\).%20,always%20include%20fallback%20strategy%20recommendations/)) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=`includes%20mk1mod2%20internal%20doctrines:%20,simulated%20doctrine%20triggers%20when%20critiquing/)).
