can be an issue in a crisis. Security is a priority, so they bury or hide caches well: digging at least 2-3 feet deep, covering with natural ground cover, and not leaving obvious markers (they memorize or map the spot). FPA might encourage dual-cache strategy: one very hidden (for you only), and one more accessible communal cache where multiple members know the spot and can use it if needed (trust-based). They also have a plan to refresh caches periodically – dig up every couple years to replace expired items and check condition. Communication wise, they probably don’t broadcast cache sites widely (OPSEC), sharing locations only with those who absolutely need to know (maybe your buddy or team). They may use coded references in personal notes to recall them. In training, maybe a class on how to choose a cache site (avoid floodplains, avoid areas likely for new development, etc.). When retrieving a cache, they do it quietly, ideally at dawn/dusk when fewer eyes are out, and cover the hole again. Overall, FPA treats caches as insurance: prepare them carefully when times are good so that if the worst happens (you’re on the run with nothing but what’s in your pockets), those buried treasures could save your life.
