- **Onboarding New Members:** New recruits are typically assigned to a squad (or form a new one) as part of Phase I (detailed in the next section). The squad structure ensures every member has peers and a mentor to guide their development from day one.  
In summary, squads are the **human layer** of the architecture â€“ they carry out tasks on the ground, implement plans, and provide the social structure that any resilience network needs. They are empowered to make decisions on the front lines, but they operate following common doctrine and within the guardrails of the Trust Doctrine.
