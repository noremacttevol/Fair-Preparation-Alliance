Accountability within FPA ensures that leaders and members alike are answerable for their actions and decisions, maintaining trust in the organization. At the leadership level, transparency measures are in place: the National Leadership Council provides regular updates to the membership on Alliance status – for example, publishing after-action reports on major drills (what went well, what needs improvement) and disclosing any significant decisions or changes in plans (like updates to the [[Mark I Mod III Framework (Current Plan)]]) to all members via the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] or meetings. Financial or resource usage (to the extent the Alliance has pooled resources or funds) is also transparent: if funds are collected for a group purchase of gear or a project, a summary of how it was spent is shared, to avoid any suspicion of misuse.
