6. **Milestone 6: Basic Training Enrollment**  
- _Real-World Example:_ The town of Springfield’s squad made it a point that within 3 months of forming, every member completed the Community Emergency Response Team **(CERT)** basic course. They coordinated with the local emergency management office to host a class just for their neighborhood. Those who couldn’t attend in person took FEMA’s free online **Independent Study** courses (IS-100 for Incident Command, IS-200, and IS-317 for CERT). When a tornado struck a year later, first responders recognized the green CERT vests and helmets of the squad members and knew they could be trusted with tasks – they had the credentials. This saved precious time in the response ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=The%20CERT%20program%20offers%20a,focus%20on%20more%20complex%20tasks)) ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=Community%20Emergency%20Response%20Team%20members,assist%20their%20neighbors%20during%20emergencies)).
