**Actionable Steps:**  
- Invite each country’s FPA leadership to nominate one representative for the International Council.  
- Draft an International Charter that outlines the council’s purpose (coordination, not control) and key agreements (e.g., sharing info, mutual aid, preserving independence of national groups).  
- Schedule regular council calls (maybe quarterly) and an annual in-person or virtual summit to build relationships and review global initiatives.  
- Create subcommittees for specific global issues: training standards, Outernet content globalization, cross-border logistics, etc., each led by different chapter reps to distribute work.  
- Ensure translation and accessibility: provide simultaneous interpretation for meetings as needed and circulate written proposals in multiple languages beforehand.
