- **Emergency Alerts and Rallying:** When a crisis hits or looms, Comms & Outreach is the one sounding the alarm. They use a **tiered alert system**: e.g., Alert Level 1 (informational), Level 2 (standby/prep), Level 3 (mobilize for an emergency), Level 4 (imminent threat, take immediate action). These alerts go out Alliance-wide or region-specific as needed. Comms ensures the **language is clear and standardized**. If an Alert Level 3 goes out, every member should instantly know what actions to take because Comms has prepped them with guidelines (like “Level 3 – check in with your squad within 30 minutes, prepare to deploy to rally point if asked, top off fuel and supplies, etc.”). Comms also manages the **rallying calls** – messages that galvanize members to volunteer for a particular operation (“We need 50 volunteers to sandbag a town against flooding, report in app if you can assist.”). They craft these to be concise but compelling, focusing on the impact and the need. They will highlight member successes to inspire others (“Shout out to Squad Delta in Region2 for hitting 100% gear readiness! Who’s next?”).
