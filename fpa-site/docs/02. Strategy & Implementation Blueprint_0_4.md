IV. Technology Backbone (Offline First)  
Described in full in [[FPA’s Offline-First Resilience System]] and [[CORE AI DEMANDS YOU’VE BUILT INTO FPA]]:  
FPA App is optional, not required.  
AI-enhanced plan testing and gear audits happen via prompts, but must also generate printable output.  
AI proposals are always supervised by human moderators ranked E-5+ (see [[AI Reliability & Human Oversight]]).  
FPA uses the [[Outernet (Offline Network)]] and the [[SHTF-Ready Notebook (“SHTF Bible”) – Comprehensive Product Design Document]] as its ground truth.  
V. Phase Progression Logic  
Tied directly to [[FPA Master Overview]] and [[ORP Master Plan]]:  
Phase 1: 0–500 members – Manual coordination, HAM drills, paper checklists, hand-vetted recruits.  
Phase 2: 500–5,000 – Roll out offline-first app, automated audits, AI-assisted training plans.  
Phase 3: 5,000–50,000 – Full integration of squad independence, live audit feeds, Outernet broadcasting.  
Phase 4+: Feedback-driven governance structure evolves via input loops.  
Phase shifts are marked by capability thresholds, not by time or hype.  
VI. Feedback, Audit & Governance Layer  
See protocols in [[Trust Doctrine]], [[FPA Alignment & Trust Protocols]], and [[FPAi Tone and Voice–]]:  
Members must receive corrective or supportive feedback within 7 days of any rank-up, report submission, or flagged event.  
Audit logs are printable, stored redundantly across squads, and fed into AI training datasets.
