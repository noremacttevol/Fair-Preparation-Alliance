To coordinate fallback activation, we utilize **prearranged signals**: This could be a specific phrase broadcasted. For instance, net control might say “Execute Alternate Plan Charlie” which in our codebook means “All stations move to contingency net at 8 MHz HF tonight” etc. Or simpler, a loud long press of the radio PTT in a certain pattern could be a signal if voice fails (like sending Morse code “FALLBACK” or a series of tones). Another method: time-based triggers – e.g., “If you hear nothing for 15 minutes, automatically go to channel Z.” We train these so it becomes second nature.  
An important fallback tool is **relay chains**. In case some squads are out of direct reach, intermediate squads will relay messages. We assign relay responsibilities in advance: e.g., Squad Echo (with a big antenna) will pick up weak signals from the valley and relay to others if needed. In drills, we simulate one group being distant and force others to relay their messages through a middleman. It’s slower but it works if disciplined.  
**Leadership Signaling and Decentralization:** When centralized command fails or is cut off, leadership has to decentralize by necessity. The Alliance cannot afford a vacuum, so we have a system to signal when a _leadership handover_ or local autonomy is in effect. Part of this is procedural (again, pre-planned) and part is signaled in real-time.
