- **Community Building & Engagement:** Outreach focuses on building a sense of community both within and around FPA. They organize **events that aren’t just training** – like social gatherings, cross-squad meetups, family picnics, etc. The logic is that bonds of friendship strengthen the alliance and keep people engaged. They’ll encourage squads to do community service (e.g., help at a soup kitchen or clean up a park) wearing FPA t-shirts, showing that “preppers” are good neighbors, not just doomsayers. For internal engagement, they might run fun contests or challenges (e.g., a photo contest of best-organized supply closet, or a referral competition for new member sign-ups) to keep people active year-round, not only during crises. Outreach also watches for member burnout or drop-off – if someone’s gone quiet, they might nudge squad leaders to check in, showing we care.
