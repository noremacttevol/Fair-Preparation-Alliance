Step 1: Scheduled Reflection Forums – FPA will hold regular (e.g., annual or semi-annual) Collective Reflection Forums that involve representatives from all circles (and are open to all members to the extent practical). This could take the form of an All-Hands Assembly, a multi-day retreat, or an online town hall, depending on context. The agenda is to critique and analyze how we are living up to our values and to surface any widespread concerns. In preparation for such a forum, surveys or feedback forms are sent out to gather input from members: What’s working well in our culture? What persistent conflicts or frustrations do you see? Where have we fallen short of our principles? The anonymity of surveys can encourage candid feedback. The results are compiled to guide the forum’s discussion topics. By scheduling these forums at predictable intervals, we create a “pressure release valve” – issues can be raised before they reach a boiling point, knowing that there is a forthcoming platform dedicated to listening.
