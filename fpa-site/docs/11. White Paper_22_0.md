**Description:** Build collaborative relationships with major disaster relief NGOs like the **American Red Cross**, **Team Rubicon**, **Salvation Army**, and others in the humanitarian space. This involves information-sharing agreements, mutual support understandings, and possibly joint deployments where FPA squads operate alongside or in support of these organizations. By partnering, FPA avoids duplicating services (e.g., we won’t run a shelter next door to a Red Cross shelter, we’ll help fill its gaps) and taps into a larger network of resources while still focusing on our agile, grassroots strengths.
**Real-World Example:** During a 2026 wildfire in Colorado, FPA volunteers linked up with Team Rubicon’s Greyshirts at a fire camp. The Red Cross managed evacuation shelters, Team Rubicon handled chainsaw crews and debris removal, and FPA squads filled odd jobs like pet rescue and delivering local knowledge (one squad mapped functional wells for water when hydrants failed). Thanks to pre-season meetings, everyone knew their role. A Red Cross shelter manager even used the FPA radio net to request extra cots from a neighboring town’s FPA cache, speeding up the supply chain beyond what her HQ could do.
