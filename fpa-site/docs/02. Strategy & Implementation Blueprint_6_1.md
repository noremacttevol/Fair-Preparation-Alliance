- **Knowledge Base:** A digital copy of the Compass Guide and FPA Dictionary is built-in, searchable and bookmarkable. Members can pull up SOPs, medical guides, engineering diagrams, etc., on the fly. Because it’s offline, a member in the field can access lifesaving info with zero latency.  
- **“Test My Plan” Simulator:** Members can input their personal or squad emergency plans into the app’s **Test My Plan** feature. The AI will analyze the plan against known best practices and scenario databases. It might simulate a scenario (e.g., a flood hitting your area) and then evaluate if your plan covers all critical needs (shelter, communication, evacuation route, etc.). It provides feedback or questions (“Have you considered what happens if X fails?”). This helps members refine their plans. Crucially, this simulation can be done offline for scenarios and data that are stored locally, with the AI model on-device or available offline as well.  
- **Incident Reporting & Logging:** During real events or drills, the app allows logging of actions taken, resources used, and outcomes. These records are timestamped and later synchronized to the central transparency logs (with appropriate encryption for sensitive data). This creates an auditable history of how each situation was handled, which is vital for after-action reviews and trust.
