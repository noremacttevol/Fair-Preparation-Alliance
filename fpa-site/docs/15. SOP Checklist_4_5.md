In short, **Phase 1 is about making yourself solid.** Phase 2 will be about multiplying that knowledge to others and strengthening your local chapter as we scale. Phase 3 will be about integrating into a nationwide resilient fabric and possibly stepping onto an even bigger stage as part of FPA’s leadership or specialized forces.  
So, as you dutifully check off the Phase-1 items, keep an eye on your interests and emerging strengths. Discuss with your squad what Phase-2 growth might mean – maybe you collectively prepare by identifying who could take what role when membership doubles. The Alliance will guide these transitions, but bottom-up readiness is just as important.
