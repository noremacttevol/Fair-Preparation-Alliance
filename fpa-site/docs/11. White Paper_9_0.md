Phase 3 of the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) Strategic Roadmap focuses on expanding community preparedness from local squads to a robust national and global network. Building on Phase 1’s individual readiness foundation and Phase 2’s local squad formation, this phase emphasizes national coordination, regional autonomy, global integration, and decentralized resilience. The aim is to interlink squads across regions and countries without sacrificing the grassroots trust and independence that define the FPA.  
Key initiatives include rolling out the **Outernet** (an off-grid satellite data broadcast network), establishing a national **HAM radio** relay system, creating a national squad registry, integrating efforts with **FEMA** and leading NGOs (e.g., Red Cross, Team Rubicon), deploying **AI** to optimize resource allocation, and expanding the FPA governance structure (introducing ranks **O1–O10** and a custom **E-10** tier for veteran volunteers). All advancements are guided by the FPA’s _Trust Doctrine_ and _Compass Guide_, ensuring that even as we scale, the network remains human-led, **AI-assisted**, and fully independent of centralized control. By the end of Phase 3, FPA will have a globally scalable, decentralized preparedness network that can self-sustain and coordinate effective disaster response anywhere in the world, underpinned by trust, transparency, and practical know-how.
