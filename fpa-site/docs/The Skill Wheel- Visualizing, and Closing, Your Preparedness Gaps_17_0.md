This plan gives your Bubble devs:  
- **Exact article structure** with gated insider details.  
- **Asset list** and formats that Sora/DALL-E can render fast.  
- **API stubs & overlay logic** for an experimental mini-widget.  
- **Sprint board** aligned to your 0-1 k launch window.  
Once you approve, Iâ€™ll draft the **public copy** word-for-word, including micro-CTA language and alt-text, so the team can drop it straight into the CMS.
