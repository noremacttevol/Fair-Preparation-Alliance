The FPA (Alliance) rank structure is a comprehensive progression system that recognizes members’ contributions and skills in emergency preparedness. It is designed to be fair, transparent, and tied directly to **contribution rather than privilege**. All members begin at the entry-level and advance through **enlisted ranks (E-1 through E-10)** by completing required preparedness tasks and earning **Alliance Points (AP)**. No one can skip ranks – each level builds on core skills and must be earned in sequence. After achieving the highest enlisted rank (E-10), members can branch into either an **Officer Track (O-1 through O-10)** for elected leadership roles or a **Prestige Track** for expert contributors who prefer a creative/support role instead of command. In all cases, higher rank brings **greater responsibility and recognition** – **not special perks or access**. Every member, regardless of rank, has the same tools and information available; rank simply reflects one’s experience, trust, and contributions to the Alliance’s mission.
