- **Balanced Scoring Algorithm:** We’ve balanced the contributions of different activity types (quizzes vs. drills vs. real experiences) to reward substance over form. In theory, someone could try to game the system by memorizing quiz answers and racking up quiz points. But we cap how far quizzes alone can take you – beyond a certain percentage, you _must_ do drills and demonstrate skills in action. High-level proficiency in any segment requires an instructor’s sign-off or real-world proof. This inherently prevents “paper tigers” – a member who only has book knowledge will hit a ceiling on their wheel until they get out and practice. By Phase3, FPAi will even help detect anomalies: e.g., if someone aces all the advanced comms quizzes but then performs poorly on a basic radio operation drill, the system (or an instructor) will flag that discrepancy for follow-up. The effect is that to have a high score, you almost certainly have the real ability to match, because the easy stuff only gets you so far.
