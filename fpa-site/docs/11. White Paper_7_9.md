- _Radio Networks:_ Develop a three-tier radio network if possible – **FRS/GMRS** walkie-talkies for local (block-level) comms, **HAM radios** for long-range and external contact, and explore emerging solutions like **LoRa mesh devices** (long-range low-power radios) for text messaging without cell service. Implementation detail: program all radios with agreed frequencies and train members in usage. For example, designate channel 1 for emergency, channel 2 for general chatter, etc. Regularly practice radio discipline so that, come a crisis, the squad communicates succinctly and effectively. As one example, the Cobb Alert Net group structured their comms by licensing some members for GMRS and sourcing bulk FRS radios for neighbors – FPA squads can replicate this by applying for FCC family licenses and seeking group discounts on devices.
