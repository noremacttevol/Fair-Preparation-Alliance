1. **Sign the pledge and commit:** Complete your FPA membership application, including signing the member agreement and **paying your first $5** dues. This nominal fee activates your membership. More importantly, you’re pledging to uphold FPA’s values (fairness, integrity, teamwork, etc.) and to put in work, not just words. _(If you haven’t done this yet, do not pass Go – the FPA is for committed members only.)_  
2. **Run “Test My Plan” for a reality check:** Use the **[[Test My Plan]]** AI tool (or the paper equivalent questionnaire) to evaluate your current emergency plan. Input details about how you’d handle a disaster _right now_. The tool will spit out an assessment of your strengths and weaknessesfile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpagfile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. Pay attention to the weaknesses! This is your starting baseline. Print or save the suggestions it gives – you’ll be addressing them as you work through the rest of this checklist. (If you don’t have a personal plan at all, the tool will guide you to create one. Either way, do this first to identify your gaps.)
