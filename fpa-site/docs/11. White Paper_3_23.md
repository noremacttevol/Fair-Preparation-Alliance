cage or buy devices with minimal electronics. For example, a simple analog crank radio or old-school CB might survive an EMP better than a modern smartphone. We also ran tests: one member built a DIY Faraday box from foil and cardboard and managed to shield a handheld radio successfully (verified by signal tests) ([EMP Protection for the Radio Amateur, an Encore. - Off Grid Ham](https://offgridham.com/2018/02/emp-encore/#:~:text=Charles%E2%80%99%20testing%20demonstrates%20that%20the,as%20one%20of%20the%20layers)) ([EMP Protection for the Radio Amateur, an Encore. - Off Grid Ham](https://offgridham.com/2018/02/emp-encore/#:~:text=Charles%E2%80%99%20home,HAM%20READER%20SUBMITTED%20PHOTO%20%C2%A92016)). So we propagate that knowledge – EMP-proofing doesn’t have to be expensive (just meticulous). Finally, through drills we saw that people forget to plan for power for their comm devices. Lesson: all the radios in the world won’t help if your batteries are dead and you can’t recharge. So part of this milestone is ensuring off-grid power for comms (even if just a stash of extra batteries or a small solar panel).
