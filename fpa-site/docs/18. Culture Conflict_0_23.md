Regular Check-Ins and Tension Rounds: Many squads and circles hold routine forums to surface tensions. This can be a standing agenda item in weekly meetings (e.g., “Does anyone have any concerns or frictions to discuss?”) or dedicated sessions such as monthly retrospectives. Some circles use a practice inspired by **“values days” or “safe space circles”**, where members share any worries about team dynamics or instances where they felt our values were challenged. By scheduling these reflection moments, we lower the barrier for speaking up – it feels natural to say “I have a concern” when the whole team is in a mindset of listening. At a larger scale, FPA might conduct an annual retreat or survey focusing on cultural health, giving everyone an opportunity to voice grievances or ideas for improvement in an appropriate forum.
