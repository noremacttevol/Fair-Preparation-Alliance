Every member is expected to have a field-ready kit appropriate to their role and rank. Kits are standardized in three tiers:  
|**Tier**|**Key Contents**|**Member Fit**|
|---|---|---|
|**Tier I (Basic)**|Notebook & pencil, “pulse” schedule card (comm check timetable), basic VHF handheld radio.|Entry-level members (ranks E-1 to E-2).|
|**Tier II (Standard)**|_All Tier I items, plus:_ printed SOP quick sheets, local maps, whistle, multi-tool/knife, and a squad signal plan card.|Core squad members (ranks E-3 to E-5).|
|**Tier III (Advanced)**|_All Tier II items, plus:_ long-range HF radio, encrypted USB with full data backup, full printed Compass Guide, and a solar charger.|Squad leads, senior members (E-6+), and dedicated comm nodes.|  
Every squad should have **at least one TierII or III kit** in good working order at all times. Quarterly drills include a gear inspection to verify these kits are complete and functional. This ensures that when an emergency strikes, the tools needed for communication and coordination are immediately on hand.
