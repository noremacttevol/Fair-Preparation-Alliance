The "Realnet" is envisioned as a two-way, community-driven network that can function without the internet – basically a people’s intranet that keeps data and communications flowing locally when the wider net is gone. It’s “real” in the sense that it’s grounded in physical, decentralized connections: think of Wi-Fi links between neighbors, ham radio digital nodes, and mesh networking devices all interconnecting. In practice, Realnet might use technologies like the Reticulum Network Stack (which some call the “prepper internet”) along with LoRa radios, long-range Wi-Fi, and wired links to form a web of connectivity. Each FPA member or safe location might act as a node – for example, a Raspberry Pi with a radio hat can serve as a node that stores and forwards messages. When these nodes link up (via any available means: a direct cable, a microwave link, a burst data over ham frequencies), they create a mesh that routes information around damage or outages. Realnet can carry emails, forum posts, position reports, and even voice if there’s enough bandwidth – but at its core it’s like a local version of the internet’s basic services: messaging, file transfer, and maybe local web pages, all hosted within the community. The key difference from Outernet is interactivity: Realnet lets members send as well as receive. For example, a member could post a request for help on the Realnet bulletin board, and others on the mesh will see it and respond, all without any ISP. It is inherently
