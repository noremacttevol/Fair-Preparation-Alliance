**Note:** These levels are not military ranks; they’re markers of proficiency. An FPA member doesn’t “command” someone of a lower level by virtue of rank – leadership still depends on assigned roles (like being a Squad Leader). But generally, higher-level members naturally end up in leadership or advisory positions because of their experience.
