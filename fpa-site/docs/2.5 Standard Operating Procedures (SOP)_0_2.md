Travel and Relocation Plans: Guidance for what members should do if they need to evacuate or travel to support others. For instance, a procedure if communications are down: after a set time with no contact, nearby members physically check on each other. Or if a member is traveling during a crisis, the SOP might have them attempt to link up with the nearest FPA chapter (with a directory of chapters included).  
Safety and Conduct During Operations: Reinforcing that even under stress, members follow laws (as possible) and ethical conduct. For example, if encountering other survivor groups, the SOP might advise a protocol of cautious approach offering help, but not revealing everything (keeping group safety first). If violence is encountered, it stresses defensive action only ([[Self-Defense and Firearms Training]] guidelines integrated). Also, medical SOPs: e.g., basic triage procedures if multiple members are injured, and who leads medical decisions ([[Emergency Medical Preparedness]] covers some).  
After-Action and Documentation: The SOP requires that after any major event or drill, the chapter lead compiles an After-Action Report (AAR) noting what happened, how the group responded, and lessons learned ([[Continuous Improvement and AARs]]). These AARs are then shared (sanitized of personal details) upward so the Alliance as a whole can update practices. This practice feeds into the iterative improvement of FPAâ€™s framework ([[Plan Updates and Versioning]]).
