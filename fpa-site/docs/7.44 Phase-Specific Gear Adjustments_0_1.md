- Phase 3 (Grid-Down / Black-Sky): Now reliance is entirely on what one has. Simpler, manually-operated gear shines here: hand pumps, solar oven for cooking when fuel is gone, bicycles if vehicles have no fuel. High-tech gear might become bricks if power and comms fail (unless one has solar to keep them). FPA trains to revert to low-tech methods: using paper maps instead of GPS, hand tools instead of power tools, making fires for heat if HVAC is out. Gear usage becomes about conservation: rationing batteries, using multi-use items to the max. Also, Phase 3 might require self-defense gear to be at the ready constantly, whereas in Phase 1 it was stored securely.  
- Go/No-Go Gear: They identify what gear to jettison as phases change. For instance, in a hasty evacuation (transition to Phase 3 chaos), a member might leave behind non-essentials like heavy luxuries to make room for more water or medical supplies. The Alliance has “last minute lists” for Phase 2 -> 3 transitions: if time allows, grab X (e.g., fill the bathtub with water, take the family photo albums for morale), but if not, stick to the life-sustaining basics.
