Certain events **trigger an immediate shift** into higher readiness modes or even System Override. In Mk1Mod3, our emergency trigger logic is well-defined:  
**Triggers:**  
- **Grid down** (power outage) for 48+ hours.  
- **Leadership comms dark** – no contact with national or regional leadership (assume top of chain is offline).  
- **AI failure or lockout** – FPA AI systems go unresponsive or their outputs fail trust validation (e.g. trip the Trust Firewall).  
**Immediate Actions:**  
1. **Activate Offline SOPs:** Switch to printed emergency protocols (e.g. break out the Compass Guide and local drill manuals).  
2. **Radio Network Up:** Initiate radio communications nets. Use 7.200MHz HF as the primary “all-call” frequency, with regional VHF channels as fallback.  
3. **Paper Trust Chain:** Implement the backup leadership chain. Squads confirm their fallback leader using a paper log or signed roster (at least 3 member signatures to validate the new point person).  
4. **Analog Coordination:** Move all critical logging and coordination to offline methods – e.g. switch to paper logs for resource tracking and issue pre-printed task cards for urgent roles.  
In essence, when these triggers hit, **local squads take charge.** No member waits for permission to protect their area. Coordination continues through alternative means:  
- Printed manuals and SOP binders (for guidance when digital tools are down).  
- Field radios and community bulletin boards (for communication).
