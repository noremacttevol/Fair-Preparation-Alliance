- **Enforcement and Oversight:** The day-to-day enforcement of the doctrine is a shared responsibility. All members are encouraged to self-police and peer-police gently – reminding each other of the rules when necessary. For more formal oversight, the Alliance may appoint an **Ethics & Trust Council** (or use the existing leadership council) to handle serious violations. For example, if a member is accused of taking a bribe from a vendor, the Council would investigate (review logs, interview involved parties) and recommend action (revoking membership, etc.) according to this doctrine and the Trust Doctrine’s provisions. Similarly, if a vendor misuses our endorsement, a small team (including perhaps our legal advisor if available) will address it with that vendor. We also leverage our systems: the trust and cred system automatically flags suspicious behavior, and our platform might restrict capabilities (like voting or posting) for members who trigger certain red flags, pending human review. All enforcement actions are documented. Members who are found in violation have a right to know what they did wrong (we keep the process transparent) and may appeal to a panel of peers. But ultimately, upholding the integrity of the Alliance comes first.
