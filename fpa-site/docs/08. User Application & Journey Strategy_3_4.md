Applicants approved (via AI or admin) are prompted to activate a paid membership (still **$5/month** in Phase2) as part of onboarding.

Payment confirmation is tied to account activation so that only paying, committed members proceed. The Alliance’s fair pricing is transparent (e.g. the app can show “$5 now, will drop as we grow” with the formula).
