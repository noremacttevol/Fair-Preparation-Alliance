each member ultimately acts in self-defense within legal bounds. On a community level, FPA doesn’t present as a militia; they keep a low profile about weaponry in public-facing aspects. Internally, they discuss it frankly: who is armed, what calibers for ammo sharing, setting up a perimeter if needed. One part of the policy: respect each other’s choices – members who opt out of firearms aren’t pressured; those who opt in aren’t demonized. It’s treated as one tool among many. They also prepare for non-lethal defense (pepper spray, batons, etc.) and emphasize medical readiness to treat injuries if violence does occur. In essence, FPA’s take: Firearms can save lives in extreme situations but come with great responsibility. If you have one, train, secure it, and handle it professionally. If you don’t, you still have a vital role in the alliance’s security plan. [#Intermediate] [#Security]
