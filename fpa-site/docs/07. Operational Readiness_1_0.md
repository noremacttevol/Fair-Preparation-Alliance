Readiness isn’t just a mindset—it’s a coordinated **system**. This doctrine outlines how the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) shifts from day-to-day calm into full emergency response during disasters, blackouts, or total grid collapse. The Mk1Mod3 version builds on earlier practices (Mk1Mod2) by hardening our offline-first infrastructure, formalizing a trust-based leadership chain, and cementing squad-synchronized fallback protocols. The goal is that every team knows **what to do, when to do it, and who to follow**—without waiting for orders from above.
