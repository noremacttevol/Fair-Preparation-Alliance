Technological Vulnerabilities: Over-reliance on Infrastructure. If FPA plans to use digital platforms (apps, data hubs, online courses), it must contend with the fact that those technologies may fail exactly when needed most (power outages, cyber-attacks, communication breakdowns). For example, a strength of modern emergency management is redundant communication – FEMA’s preparedness apps deliver real-time alerts. If FPA’s network relies on internet and cellular networks without backup methods (like radio or satellite), it could go dark in a disaster. Cybersecurity is another concern; a system coordinating resources and data might be targeted by malicious actors. Without robust protection (as seen in systems like Estonia’s blockchain-secured data embassies), FPA’s data or communications could be sabotaged.
