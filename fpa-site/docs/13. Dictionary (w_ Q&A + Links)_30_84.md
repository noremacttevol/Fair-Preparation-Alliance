effort or gaps – FPA might use something like an incident command system informally to assign tasks (food distribution by one cell, medical camp by another, etc.). Because it’s multi-region, help could also come from completely unaffected FPA members farther away (sending supplies via trucks or even coordinating donations). They would maintain the Trust Doctrine – any external volunteers from far away are paired with known FPA liaisons to ensure they integrate smoothly. All this requires practice, so FPA likely has done scenarios or has an emergency ops center plan for multi-region events. It’s like patchwork: each square (chapter) covers its area, stitches to neighbors, forming a larger quilt of response that, while decentralized, can cover a big area through communication and mutual support threads.
