**Contingency Plan:** If our membership is delayed or if VOAD isn’t active in a particular crisis, we still coordinate ad hoc as we did before – VOAD just makes it easier. FPA squads should never wait on bureaucracy to act in life-saving situations, but VOAD guidance will help us plug into official relief when it arrives. Should a joint exercise reveal major issues (like an agency not wanting to work with “unofficial” volunteers), we address it through relationship-building or adjust our approach (maybe we operate just outside the hot zone and feed information in, instead of direct integration, until trust is earned). If political shifts ever threaten VOAD itself (funding cuts or leadership changes), FPA will maintain those peer relationships directly – essentially VOAD formalizes connections that we can sustain informally if needed. In short, formal networks are great, but FPA’s true resilience is that even if they vanish, we still know how to reach our partners and get the job done.
