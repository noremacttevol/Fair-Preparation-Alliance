**Seeing the Big Picture:** In the daily grind of setting up radio repeaters, writing Facebook posts, or laminating guides, it can be easy to lose sight of the profound impact of your work. But consider a future scenario, perhaps 10 or 20 years from now: a massive event hits, perhaps even nation-wide – communications and usual order are disrupted at a scale we haven’t seen. In that dark moment, a light stays on: clusters of communities across the country (or the world) that continue to function and help each other, because they have this decentralized network we’re building right now. In that future, people may call it something else, they may not even know FPA’s name, but they will benefit from the culture and system we established. This is _legacy_. Just as the US Constitution, written in 1787, still guides a nation centuries later through countless unforeseen challenges, the doctrines and systems we create could guide citizens through disasters long after we’re gone.
