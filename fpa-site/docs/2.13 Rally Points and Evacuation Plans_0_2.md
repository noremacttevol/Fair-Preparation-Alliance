permitting). They also might leave a message or sign at the rally point for latecomers – e.g., chalk mark or note saying where the group went next if they had to move. On-Site Actions: Depending on the scenario, once at the rally point, the group might not stay long (it might just be a link-up location before traveling onward out of danger), or it might become a temporary camp/base. For example, in a fast wildfire evacuation, rally point is just to ensure everyone made it out, then the plan may be to continue together to a more distant safe zone. In a slower crisis like societal unrest, the rally point (if at a member’s secure home) could become the operating base. FPA’s plan covers both: a quick regroup then onward travel, or setting up a semi-permanent camp. Supplies at Rally: Ideally, rally points (at least primary) have some pre-staged supplies. If it’s a member’s home or property, that member likely stored group supplies (water, fuel, extra food, and tools) anticipating its use as a safehouse. If it’s a public spot, perhaps a cache could be buried nearby (though on public land that can be tricky). At minimum, the first arrivals bring what they can to support the group until everyone consolidates resources. Alternate Communication if Stragglers: If someone is delayed or circumstances force a change, FPA has protocols like leaving behind a “relay” person or a note. For instance, if they must depart the rally due to danger, they leave a written message in a secure but
