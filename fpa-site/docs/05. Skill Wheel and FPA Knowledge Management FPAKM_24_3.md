- **Healthcare Competency Frameworks:** In healthcare, professionals maintain competencies across multiple domains (clinical skills, communication, critical thinking, etc.), and hospitals use tracking systems to ensure each staff member is up-to-date on required skills (e.g., CPR certifications, medication administration competencies). A key lesson from healthcare is the premium on **accuracy** – lives depend on it. You do _not_ want an incompetent surgeon falsely certified as competent, nor do you want to bar a talented nurse from doing a procedure just because a box wasn’t checked. To address this, healthcare competency systems combine written tests with direct supervisor observation and mentoring. We mirrored that approach by mixing quizzes, drills, and real-world checks in our inputs. Another aspect is continuous development: doctors and nurses have ongoing education requirements (CMEs, etc.) and multi-tier competency frameworks. For example, the NAHQ Healthcare Quality Competency Framework defines 8 domains of competency with 3 levels of proficiency, and professionals self-assess or are assessed to identify gaps. We found this multi-domain, leveled approach very relevant – it reinforced our design of discrete skill categories with progressive levels (our 10%-increment visual scale roughly maps to novice → intermediate → advanced expertise). Healthcare also warns against **credential inflation** – collecting certificates that don’t translate to real skill. That’s why our
