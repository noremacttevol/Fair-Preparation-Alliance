Training to “Speak Up”: Recognizing that identifying conflict often requires courage and skill, FPA invests in training all members on communication and conflict awareness. From the moment someone joins, we emphasize: conflict itself isn’t failure; not voicing or addressing it is. New members receive orientation on this framework and participate in basic workshops (e.g., on Nonviolent Communication and active listening). They learn how to give constructive feedback, how to approach a colleague to discuss a tension, and how to receive criticism without defensiveness. By building these skills, we make it more likely that emerging conflicts will be caught and resolved early at the peer level. Ongoing refreshers and advanced training are offered as well – for instance, squad leads and Trust Liaisons might do role-playing exercises in mediation, and all members might periodically take part in scenario discussions, so that the language of conflict resolution becomes second nature. This education also covers bias and cultural sensitivity, so that misunderstandings stemming from cultural differences or unconscious bias can be recognized and addressed before they escalate.
