--># FPA Mk1Mod3 – Core Innovations Doctrine  
**Introduction:** The Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) is charting a bold path forward with a suite of **12 game-changing innovations** to elevate community preparedness. This Mk1Mod3 strategic doctrine expands upon the _Innovations Roll-Up_ list, transforming each initiative into a core directive for members. Every innovation described here addresses a critical gap in preparedness, aligning with FPA’s Compass Guide principles and Trust Doctrine values. This is a **living doctrine** – a field-ready playbook that will evolve with member feedback and emerging challenges. It is written in a **member-facing tone** with tactical clarity, to motivate and empower each of you. Together, these innovations prove FPA is not just planning for a better future – **we’re already building it.**  
**(1) EMP‑Shielded Comms Mission**
**What it is:** A mission to harden our communication networks against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events. This involves deploying **EMP-shielded communication gear** (e.g. radios, signal repeaters, storage drives) in Faraday-cage enclosures and training members on EMP-resistant protocols. In practice, it means our critical comms equipment – from HAM radios to hard drives with FPA data – are stored or used in shielded setups so they’ll survive an EMP or solar flare.
