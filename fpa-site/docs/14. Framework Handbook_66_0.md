**Regular Meetups:** Each squad meets regularly (often monthly in person, with more frequent check-ins virtually) even during “blue sky” times. These meetups involve training, equipment checks, and building camaraderie. In Mk1Mod2, groups that didn’t meet routinely often fell apart; Mk1Mod3 squads treat regular interaction as a priority, so that when an emergency arises, the team can hit the ground running.  
**Chain of Command:** The Squad Leader coordinates tasks and assigns roles before and during an incident. They aren’t a dictator – good leaders delegate and listen to their team’s expertise (the Medic decides medical matters, etc.) – but they provide a single point of decision to avoid confusion. If the Squad Leader is absent or overwhelmed, a pre-designated second-in-command (often the Communications Lead or an experienced member) takes over. This way, leadership is continuous.  
**Inter-Squad Coordination:** Squads do not exist in a vacuum. They link with the broader FPA structure via a few mechanisms:  
- **Regional Chapters:** Squads in the same town/city or county form a chapter that shares information and resources. Chapters have coordinators (often chosen from squad leaders) who facilitate communication among squads. For example, if one squad needs extra hands or gear during a crisis, the chapter coordinator will rally assistance from other nearby squads.
