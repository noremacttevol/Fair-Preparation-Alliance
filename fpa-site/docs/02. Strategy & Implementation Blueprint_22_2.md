|**Power Supply**|Electrical grid or vehicle power to charge devices|Solar chargers, battery banks, generator, hand-crank chargers|
|**Data Logging**|Digital transparency log (central & synced)|Local log books (write down key events); device-stored logs to sync later; multiple devices holding copies|
|**Leadership**|Designated squad leader and comms to HQ|Deputy leader within squad steps up; neighbor squad leader support; pre-delegated authority if higher command is cut off|
|**Medical Assistance**|Trained medic in squad with medical kit|Backup medic or cross-training of all members in basic first aid; external aid via community or other squads if available|
|**Resource Supply**|Personal carry kits & local caches|Mutual aid from nearby squads; community resources sharing; improvised sourcing (e.g., rainwater harvesting if supply lost)|  
In all cases, the mindset is **anticipate failure, pre-plan the workaround**. By having these redundancies, FPA can continue to function when others might be knocked out of action. This not only protects our members but positions us to be a source of stability for others who didn’t prepare. It’s a heavy responsibility, but one we address with rigor and realism.
