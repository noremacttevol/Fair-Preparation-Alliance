- **Auditing Other Content Families:** Oversight means they sometimes have to inspect or audit other content families’ work for compliance. For example, they might audit a Readiness drill to ensure safety protocols were followed, or review Outreach materials to ensure they didn’t promise something against policy. These are friendly audits usually – not to micromanage, but to catch issues. Because this team is separate from daily ops, they have the advantage of a **neutral perspective**. They can often see blind spots that those in the fray miss. And they report those findings to Core Coordination and the respective team leads for action. In critical issues (like a serious violation of conduct), they have the power to suspend operations or individuals pending review.
