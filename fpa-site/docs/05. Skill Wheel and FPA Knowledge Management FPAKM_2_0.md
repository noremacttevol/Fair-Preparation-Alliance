Surrounding the center, the wheel is divided into segmented slices or rings. Each segment represents a **core skill category** critical to survival preparedness. For example, the core categories might include:  
- **First Aid & Medical** – emergency medical response, trauma care, CPR, etc.  
- **Communications (Comms)** – radio operation, signaling, emergency communication protocols.  
- **Survivalcraft** – wilderness survival skills: shelter building, firecraft, foraging, water purification.  
- **Navigation** – land navigation with map and compass, GPS use, route planning.  
- _(Additional categories)_ – Depending on FPA’s scope, other segments could cover **Security/Self-Defense**, **Logistics & Supplies**, **Planning/Leadership**, **Engineering/Repair**, etc. The system is flexible enough to include all key domains defined in the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]].  
Each segment is **color-coded** for quick recognition (e.g. First Aid could be red, Comms blue, Survivalcraft green, Navigation yellow, etc.), creating a vibrant and intuitive wheel. The colors align with common associations (red for medical, green for outdoors, and so on), helping members instantly identify which areas are well-developed and which are lacking.
