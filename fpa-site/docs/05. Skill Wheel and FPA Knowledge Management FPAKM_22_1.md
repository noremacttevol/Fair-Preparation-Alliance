- **FPA Mobile App:** The app is the primary user interface for members to interact with the Skill Wheel (especially starting in Phase2). The profile section of the app will prominently feature the member’s Skill Wheel graphic and key stats. We’ll use app capabilities to support the system: for example, push notifications might remind a member to work on a weak area, the app’s camera can be used to scan or upload proof of real-world training (like taking a photo of a first aid certificate for verification), GPS might be used to trigger learning suggestions when traveling (e.g., “You’re in mountainous terrain this week – a good chance to practice Navigation skills!”). The app will also serve as the portal for **Adaptive Quizzes** (eventually tailoring question difficulty to the user’s level) and for delivering the AI’s recommendations directly to members. We’re mindful of keeping the UI uncluttered – likely the Skill Wheel view in the app will initially show the colored wheel and maybe an overall readiness score, with taps or swipes to drill down into details.
