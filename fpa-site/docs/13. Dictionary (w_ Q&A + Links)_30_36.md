A: FPA groups train for communications blackouts by conducting drills where they intentionally simulate a loss of regular comms. For instance, a local chapter might declare that for the next 48 hours, no one uses phones or the internet to coordinate – instead, they have to rely on pre-planned backup methods like radio, meeting at predetermined locations, or sending runners (people physically going to deliver messages). Many groups practice using handheld radios on simplex mode (direct radio-to-radio) as if repeaters or cell towers are down, to see how far their signals reach and where dead spots are. They might schedule check-in times (e.g., “if a blackout happens, every member will try to contact the team lead at 9 AM and 6 PM on the radio”). Some even have contingency rendezvous points if all else fails: like, if you hear nothing, on day 3 meet at X location at noon. These get tested too. Additionally, FPA might use code sheets or simple encryption for radio if they worry about eavesdropping, practicing those procedures. On a larger scale, they organize ham radio nets with operators in different regions sending relays, mimicking an internet outage where ham is the only link. All these exercises are debriefed: what worked, what didn’t, who we couldn’t reach, etc., and then they tweak their comms plan. Essentially, practice involves periodic “dark sky” events – cut the lights (comms-wise) and force everyone to get messages through the old-fashioned or redundant way, so when
