**Scope:** In Phase1, the Skill Wheel is introduced in a simplified form, primarily as a manually-updated profile element. The focus is on establishing the core categories, defining basic scoring rubrics, and getting member buy-in through education and feedback.  
- **Basic Wheel Rollout:** We will start by creating paper-based or static digital versions of the Skill Wheel for each member. For example, an instructor might fill out a printed wheel chart during a new member’s initial evaluation or orientation. Quizzes, if any, might be on paper or simple Google Forms, with instructors recording the scores afterward. The emphasis is on familiarizing everyone with the concept of the wheel.  
- **Manual Verification:** During this phase, all inputs go through human verification. If a member claims a skill or certification (e.g. “I am CPR certified”), an instructor or admin will check the documentation and then mark their First Aid segment accordingly. This ensures data integrity from the outset and also helps refine our scoring process with expert oversight. Essentially, Phase1 uses human judgment at every step to make sure the system’s foundation is solid.  
- **Minimal Tech:** The FPA app/software at this stage might not be fully interactive with the wheel. It could be as simple as showing a static image or chart of the member’s wheel that an administrator updates periodically. Members won’t be updating their own profiles yet through the app.
