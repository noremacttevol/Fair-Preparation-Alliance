- Set a weekly or biweekly radio check schedule. For example, “Every Sunday 5 PM, all squad members turn on their radio to channel X for a voice check-in.” This normalizes usage and ensures everyone knows how to operate their device. It also tests your range and can reveal if you need to adjust (maybe an external antenna or using a different channel).  
- Develop simple radio protocols: establish clear language like “EMERGENCY, EMERGENCY” for real distress, avoid chatter during operations, use call signs or names clearly (“Team1 this is Base”, etc.), and ensure everyone knows not to transmit sensitive personal info in the clear (privacy even on radio). The FPA Dictionary might list standard codes or terms – adopt them for consistency.
