4. **Personal Plan Simulations – “Test My Plan”:** In addition to the above, the **[[Test My Plan]]** tool within Mk1Mod3 can serve as an indirect input to the Skill Wheel. _Test My Plan_ is essentially an AI-driven simulation that evaluates a member’s personal emergency preparedness plan. If a member’s plan has glaring gaps that point to skill deficiencies, the system can reflect that in their Skill Wheel. For example, if the simulation finds their plan lacks an alternative communication method, it suggests a weakness in Communications knowledge – the member might not know how to set that up. The Skill Wheel could flag this (or even cap their Comms segment at a certain level) until they improve their plan and retest. Conversely, a well-crafted, thoroughly tested plan indicates the member can effectively apply their knowledge, which validates their skill levels. (We may not give an explicit percentage boost solely for a good plan, but it reinforces their existing scores and confidence.) This integration ensures that _planning and execution are linked_: it’s not enough to have isolated skills, one must integrate them into a coherent personal plan. In the future, we might even add a badge or tag on the profile (such as “Plan-Tested”) to denote that the member has successfully combined their skills in a scenario. This encourages members to not just learn in the abstract, but to put their skills to use in their own lives – closing the loop between knowledge and preparedness
