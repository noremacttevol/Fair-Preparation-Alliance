- _Contingency Plan:_ If no one local is a HAM and you can’t interest anyone to become one (exams can be a hurdle), identify alternate long-range comm strategies. For example, some satellite messengers (Garmin InReach, etc.) allow short text via satellite – maybe a local hiking enthusiast has one you can borrow in a pinch. Or even arrange a phone tree that extends out of region: e.g., a relative in a different city who can be an information relay between your squad and outside world via whatever comms they have. Still, HAM networks are so prevalent and robust that it’s worth continuously trying to recruit at least one HAM-oriented member (maybe a tech-savvy teen who can be mentored into it). Keep an updated list of known HAM operators in your vicinity, even if they’re not in the squad – during disaster, they often volunteer spontaneously; having their contact or call sign could integrate them as auxiliaries to your squad on the fly.
