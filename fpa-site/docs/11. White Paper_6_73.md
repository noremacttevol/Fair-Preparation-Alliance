25. **Milestone 25: Fundraising and Grant Applications**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A community squad held a small fundraiser BBQ and raised $800, which they used to buy a sturdy used generator and bulk emergency blankets. Another applied for a local community resilience grant and won $5,000, enabling them to equip all members with go-bags and to fund advanced training. On the flip side, a squad that ignored funding found themselves reaching into personal pockets repeatedly, which led to volunteer drop-off (not everyone can afford that). Funding can also come in kind: one hardware store’s owner agreed to donate whatever supplies the squad needed post-disaster, in exchange for the squad giving a preparedness talk at the store’s annual sale event.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ Money isn’t everything, but it sure helps. **Aggressive realism** means acknowledging that some objectives require funds – whether for gear, training fees, or communication tools. Many low-resource communities assume grants are out of reach, but there are often small grants aimed exactly at grassroots preparedness. **Lesson:** Be bold in seeking financial or in-kind support. Use transparency to your advantage: show exactly how funds will be used for community benefit. And decentralize fundraising efforts – it shouldn’t always be one person begging for money; make it a team venture or attach it to community activities.
