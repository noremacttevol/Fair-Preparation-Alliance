- **Mentorship:** FPA will leverage its community by pairing newcomers with experienced members as mentors or “battle buddies.” A mentor’s robust Skill Wheel serves as inspiration, and mentors can reassure new members that _everyone starts with small slices_ and builds up over time. Mentors will actively guide newbies through their initial trainings, helping them navigate the resources and perhaps training alongside them. This not only improves the newcomers’ skills faster but also shows them they’re not alone – it’s a team effort.
