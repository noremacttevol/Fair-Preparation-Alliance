The key to fallback nets is **clarity and practice**. Everyone must know the triggers for switching and the procedures. For instance, a common Alliance rule might be: “If you’re on a net and the net control hasn’t been heard from in X minutes, assume they are down and fall back to channel Y where a new net control will assume.” Or “If our chapter’s primary frequency is overwhelmed or compromised, we will break into sub-nets by team on pre-set channels.” We document these in a “Communications SOP” that all squads have printed.  
One practical example: Our region uses a PACE where Primary = WhatsApp group (pre-disaster), Alternate = HAM repeater, Contingency = HAM simplex, Emergency = meet at the church parking lot at noon daily. When a massive earthquake hits knocking out internet and power, obviously WhatsApp fails – immediately those who can turn on radios go to the repeater (Alternate). It might be down due to power, so within minutes they know to move to simplex frequency. Squads check in there. One squad doesn’t show up on air – maybe their radios are lost. According to plan, by emergency day 2, that missing squad (if they followed plan) will send a person to the physical meetup point at noon and find a note from others or an Alliance liaison with instructions. These layers ensure **nobody gets completely lost**. Fallback nets mean even if high-tech comms fail, we have _manual networks_ to fall back on.
