**Objective:** Develop the member into a fully contributing squad member capable of executing duties under stress.  
In Phase II, the member is no longer a pure novice. They are expected to actively participate in all squad operations:  
- **Active Participation:** Phase II members take on regular duties in drills and real missions. They rotate through different roles to gain experience (one drill they handle radio comms, another they do first aid, etc.). This broadens their skill set and lets them find where they excel.  
- **Advanced Training:** Alongside hands-on practice, Phase II involves completing more advanced training modules. For example, courses on advanced first aid, navigation, or team leadership fundamentals might be assigned based on interest or squad needs. “Test My Plan” scenarios at this stage might involve the member being given a scenario to lead under supervision, then reviewing performance.  
- **Skill Proficiency:** By the end of Phase II, the member should be proficient in at least one area (their “specialty”) and competent in all basic areas of squad operation. The squad leader will verify that the member can be relied upon to carry out tasks without needing hand-holding. This might be confirmed in a higher-stakes drill or a field exercise.
