- Agree on scope: for example, will the squad assist in all hazards (fire, storm, quake) or specialize (like only wildfire defense)? Will you also do preparedness education or just emergency response? Write this down.  
- Establish a simple decision process: consensus if possible, or majority vote for major decisions? Emphasize that **all members have a voice** – empowerment is key.  
- Document this purpose and values statement (even in an email or shared doc) and distribute to all members. New recruits should get this orientation too.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If there’s disagreement on purpose (e.g., some want to include crime watch or other unrelated efforts), table the non-emergency topics for now. Remind the group that Phase 2’s priority is disaster prep and response – other community issues can be tackled once core readiness is achieved (perhaps spin off later). In case of stalemate, defer to the overarching FPA mission as a guidepost. Keep the initial charter flexible; it can be revised in future if needed by consensus.
