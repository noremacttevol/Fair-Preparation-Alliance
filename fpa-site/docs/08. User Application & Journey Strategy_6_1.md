- **Offline Content Availability:** From the start, members are given the means to access crucial information offline. In Phase1, this is via printable PDFs (personal emergency plan, guides) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=,coded%20signals,%20reunification%20drills/)). By Phase2, the **SHTF Bible** (comprehensive manual) is downloadable or offered in a physical format to every member. The app’s **“Print Bundle”** function lets a user generate a packet of all their key info (their plan, squad roster, SOPs) at any time. This practice is ingrained—members are reminded to update and print their packet after major changes. Many keep a binder (“FPA Handbook”) at home, which is effectively a hard backup of the app’s critical data for that user ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=many%20members%20keep%20a%20printed,down%20conditions/)) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=in%20essence,%20the%20shtf%20bible,being%20prepared%20the%20fpa%20way/)). Tooltips and onboarding tasks prompt users to do this, so it becomes a habit.
