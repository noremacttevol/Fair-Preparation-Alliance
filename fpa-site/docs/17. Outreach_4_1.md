**Transparent & Trustworthy:** Trust is the currency of effective outreach. All the protocols and tech in the world mean nothing if people doubt the message. Our strategy incorporates the **FPA Trust Doctrine** at every level: policies for verifying information, communicating candidly, and correcting errors publicly. Whether itâ€™s an instructional YouTube video or a printed flyer, we include our sources, we display credentials of our experts, and we avoid conflicts of interest (no hidden product endorsements or political agendas). If a mistake is made (e.g., we share a tip later proven suboptimal), we issue a correction and thanks to the community members who pointed it out. This transparency must also extend to our internal operations: our top contributors and squad founders (the audience of this document) are encouraged to be forthright with their teams about what FPA is doing and why. A culture of openness internally begets trust externally.
