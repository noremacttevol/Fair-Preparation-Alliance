The FPA’s governance philosophy is built on a few blunt but crucial values. We favor **trust over control** and **action over bureaucracy**. We exist to boost **civic resilience** in the real world, not to create some new hierarchy for its own sake. Our authority is **role-based and transparent**, so everyone knows who is responsible for what. Below are our core principles:  
- **Trust Over Control:** Traditional organizations default to heavy oversight, assuming people can’t be trusted. We flip that around – FPA members are trusted to do the right thing **until proven otherwise**, not vice versa. This means we empower individuals and local teams to make decisions without waiting for top-down approval. By trusting each other’s intentions and skills, we move faster and adapt better. _In practice: if a local chapter leader has a plan to handle a flood in their town, they don’t wait for HQ to sign a form – they act, and we back them up._ Trust is our default setting; control is only applied as a safeguard when needed, not as a chokehold on every move. _(This principle echoes our [[Trust Doctrine]], placing initial faith in our people.)_
