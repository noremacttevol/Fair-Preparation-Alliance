-->FPA Strategy & Implementation Blueprint (Mk1Mod3)  
Preamble  
We, the founding members of the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA), issue this Blueprint to define how our values are translated into action. This document distills the operational strategy that guides FPA from concept to execution. It is not theory. It is our Constitution. It declares what we stand for and how we implement that stance in the real world.  
It complements the [[FPA Master Overview]] and is written for planners and senior contributors who must understand and scale the system. Every line is testable, implementable, and structured to evolve. This Blueprint will be evaluated against reality and reshaped as needed.  
Mission  
The mission of FPA is to equip every household and community with the skills, tools, and team to survive disruption without fear, confusion, or dependence on slow centralized aid. We do this by:  
Building a grassroots squad-based network,  
Replacing passive preparedness with trained coordination,  
Deploying a hybrid system of offline-first tools and digital assistance,  
Maintaining ethical trust systems at scale,  
And restoring the cultural will to act decisively before crisis hits.
