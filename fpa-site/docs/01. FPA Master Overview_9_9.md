- **Readiness Audits:** This team also conducts periodic **readiness audits** of squads/regions. Think of it as an inspection. They check: Do members have their gear updated? Are caches maintained (no expired food, fuel rotated, batteries charged)? Are rally points still viable (that abandoned barn you chose a year ago – is it still accessible)? They might do surprise “health checks” via the app or in-person. Results of these audits inform where to focus training or support. If a region consistently lags (maybe people aren’t showing up to drills), they’ll alert Core Coordination and possibly shuffle leadership or get to the root cause. The goal is uniform excellence – no weak links.  
- **Culture of Preparedness:** Last but not least, Readiness & Drills instills the **culture of perpetual preparedness**. They celebrate those who put in the effort – like highlighting “Prepper of the Month” stories in internal newsletters or awarding badges for 100% drill attendance. They encourage friendly competition as mentioned, like squad vs squad contests. They also run community outreach in that they might host free workshops for the public (with Comms & Outreach) on basic preparedness, which doubles as recruitment. Their message inside and outside the alliance: _“Preparedness is not a hobby, it’s a lifestyle.”_ And they lead by example. The folks in this team are often the most hardcore preppers among us, but they channel that passion into lifting everyone’s capabilities.
