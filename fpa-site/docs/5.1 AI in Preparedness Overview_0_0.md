Artificial Intelligence is emerging as a valuable tool in emergency preparedness, and FPA integrates AI to augment human efforts. The Alliance views AI not as a replacement for human judgment but as a force multiplier – helping analyze data, streamline planning, and provide decision support. For example, AI can quickly process complex information like weather patterns, social media signals, or logistics data to predict where resources might be needed most, tasks that would be time-consuming manually. Within FPA’s knowledge systems, AI-driven search or assistants enable members to query the vast [[7.2 FPA Knowledge Vault]] more efficiently (“find me all notes on water purification”). The overview is that AI touches multiple facets: risk assessment, training, communication, and knowledge management. However, the Alliance is mindful of AI’s limitations in low-tech scenarios – many AI tools require power and possibly internet. Thus, AI is heavily used in Phase 1 (blue-sky) for preparation and planning, and wherever possible in Phase 2 to adapt plans on the fly, but in Phase 3, reliance shifts back to basics. In summary, FPA harnesses AI when conditions allow to improve speed, foresight, and personalization in preparedness, while always having non-AI contingency methods to fall back on.
