- **Decentralized & Portable:** Rather than one big generator for the whole group, FPA encourages multiple smaller systems spread out. This way, a failure in one doesn’t black out everyone. For instance, each household might have a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) for their comms gear and a small solar charger, while the squad collectively also maintains a larger generator at a central location for community tasks (like charging multiple devices or running a field kitchen). The blueprint even includes instructions to build DIY battery packs from common lithium cells, as a community workshop project.  
- **Energy Discipline:** The blueprint isn’t just hardware; it’s practice. We teach energy management – rationing power, using low-power modes on devices, maintaining batteries (like cycling them to prolong life). FPA’s culture in Mk1Mod3 includes regular “blackout drills” where squads might go a weekend on backup power only, to test their setup and instill habits like turning off devices when not in use, or clustering activities during daylight to use solar output directly.
