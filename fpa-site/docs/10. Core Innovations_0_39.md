**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** Our focus now is to **scale up and enrich the scenario library**. In the next 30 days: (a) We’ll deploy the **SHTF Plan Builder** online module to all members – an interactive questionnaire (powered by FPAi) that any member can use to get a first draft plan and scenarios, even without a human mentor. (b) Expand our **Scenario Library** to include at least 10 new scenarios reflecting recent events (e.g., cyberattack on banking system, a severe pandemic resurgence, etc.) – these will be available for download as printable “drill cards” for chapters or families. (c) Initiate **Plan Review Swaps**: pairing members from different regions to exchange plans and provide fresh eyes (often someone far away can point out assumptions that might not hold). We’ll also create a feedback channel so common gaps identified (like missing items or steps many people overlook) can inform updates to our knowledge base and training. By day 30, we aim to have 300+ members with completed personalized plans on record. Additionally, we intend to have run at least one **multi-chapter scenario drill** (coordinated over Outernet radio) – a sort of simulation day where everyone, everywhere plays out the same scenario with local twists. This will not only test individual plans but our network’s ability to support each other. The result: a membership that isn’t following a generic script, but each with their own battle plan, well-rehearsed and ready.
