- **Information Sharing:** Integration isn’t just doing work; it’s sharing intel. Set up channels to receive official warnings (subscribe the squad liaison to any emergency manager briefings or Nixle alerts). Conversely, offer to feed ground truth info to officials: you may be the first to observe flooding in a street or how many homes are affected. Protocol: the Liaison contacts the Emergency Operations Center or 911 dispatch (if EOC not open) to report significant verified information. Some advanced arrangements: get a radio frequency or phone tree to local authorities – perhaps the squad Liaison is given access to a non-public emergency line or included in daily update calls at the EOC during a crisis. This level of trust comes after proving reliability, so work towards it.
