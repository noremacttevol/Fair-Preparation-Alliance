- **Data-Driven Logistics & Resource Allocation:** As membership and operations grow in Phase2, keeping track of resources by pen and paper wonâ€™t cut it. We bring in **logistics management systems** (again, offline-capable) to track gear, supplies, and personnel. AI helps here by optimizing distribution: e.g., if one region has a surplus of medical supplies and another is short, the system flags it and suggests a re-route. During drills or real deployments, members can report consumption of supplies through the app; the AI tallies this and projects when stocks will run low. It might also suggest procurement when it identifies a good opportunity (like a bulk sale on generator fuel or a decommissioned ambulance up for auction that we could buy for a mobile aid station). **But final calls are made by quartermasters and coordinators**, keeping practicality and context in mind.
