- _Inclusive Scheduling and Support:_ Real-life constraints like jobs, disabilities, or childcare are accommodated. Meetings rotate timing if needed (so night-shift workers can attend some), and the squad arranges child-friendly drills (perhaps having one or two members supervise a “kids corner” with safe activities during trainings so parents can focus). We also encourage members to bring a friend or aide if they need personal assistance (e.g., a visually impaired volunteer can have their guide dog or a helper present). The squad proactively invites participation from people often overlooked: those in wheelchair (planning tasks they can lead, and ensuring physical drills consider their evacuation needs), the elderly (perhaps as advisors or radio operators from home), and youths (as runners or social media coordinators). **Empowerment for vulnerable members** is key – for example, a squad might teach a homebound person how to operate a radio net control from their living room, turning a perceived “vulnerability” into an asset (they become the comms hub while others are in the field).
