23. **Milestone 23: Practice HAM Radio Relay (Advanced Comms Drill)**  
- _Real-World Example:_ Three neighboring squads wanted to be sure they could relay messages over long distance if phones were out. They organized a relay drill: Squad A sent a situation report by HAM radio to a distant operator, who then passed it via another HAM to Squad B’s operator, and so on, finally reaching Squad C 50 miles away. It was essentially a bucket brigade of radio. The first attempt was clunky, but by the third, they managed a multi-hop communication in minutes. Such relays were historically used in events like Hurricane Katrina, where amateur radio networks (e.g., ARRL’s National Traffic System) relayed health and welfare messages when normal comms failed ([ARES - ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/ares/#:~:text=Hams%20serve%20our%20communities%20when,and%20wired%20and%20wireless%20networks)). By practicing this, the squads ensured that even if isolated, they could get messages out to the world (like requesting specific aid or informing FPA central of the situation).
