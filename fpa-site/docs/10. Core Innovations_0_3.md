**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** In the next month, we plan to: (a) launch an **EMP-Shielded Comms field mission** where volunteer squads will test long-range radio contact after an EMP simulation, (b) finalize an SOP for **routine rotation of electronics** (to periodically update software/batteries on devices kept in Faraday storage), and (c) extend the program to personal gear – providing members with guidance and discount partnerships for EMP-hardened cases for their own devices. Within 30 days, every regional chapter should hold at least one EMP drill. We’ll also integrate the EMP scenario into the FPAi “Test-My-Plan” tool (so your personal emergency plan accounts for comms loss). _This initiative directly reflects our Compass Guide priority on “Reliable Communications” and underscores the Trust Doctrine tenet that **preparedness must withstand even unseen threats**【TrustDoctrine†L10-L14】._  
**Links to FPA Resources:** See **FPA Dictionary** entry on “EMP” for technical tips (e.g. what frequencies are most resilient)【Dictionary†L5-L12】. The upcoming **Communications SOP** will detail deployment protocols during an EMP event. Relevant Compass Guide reference: _“Resilience through Redundancy”_, which inspired this mission【CompassGuide†L22-L28】.
