In anticipation of supply chain failures, FPA fosters a DIY spirit through device fabrication and repair innovation. Many members have small 3D printers or CNC machines, and the Alliance compiles digital designs for critical spare parts and tools. For instance, if a radio’s battery clip breaks, instead of junking the radio, a member can print a new clip. They maintain a library of schematics: water filter housings, first-aid device components (like tourniquet windlass rods), even molds for casting metal parts. During normal times, some chapters host “maker workshops” where they practice building useful items from raw materials – such as assembling a functional rocket stove from tin cans, or making a DIY solar charger from basic electronic components. A particular innovation is repurposing e-waste: FPA tinkerers salvage parts from old laptops, appliances, or junked cars to create devices like battery banks (using 18650 cells from old electronics) or a wind turbine (from a scavenged alternator). In a future scenario where no store is open, these skills mean the group can physically make or fix what they need. FPA might also stockpile raw materials that aid fabrication: spools of filament for 3D printing, resin, epoxy, sheet metal, and a toolkit of hand tools and solar ovens for melting or molding materials. The knowledge base ([[7.7 Physical Libraries & Printing]]) includes guides on crafting and metallurgy. The alliance’s approach to innovation here is self-sufficiency at the
