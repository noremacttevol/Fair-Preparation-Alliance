Finally, **rank enforcement** is how we make sure this system is followed, even in chaotic situations. We train members to recognize authority signals (like who’s the medic, who’s the lead) via things like badges, uniform patches, or code words during offline drills. In an offline scenario (say the internet is down), a Core Member should still defer to the person who was elected Team Lead for that operation. We enforce ranks not through intimidation, but through **culture and training**: members understand why the structure exists – it saves lives and avoids confusion. If someone tries to boss others around without the standing to do so, people know to call them out. Conversely, if someone with a designated role gives direction, members verify their identity/role (we have offline ID cards and challenge phrases for verification in case of imposters) and then follow the plan. This way, even when our high-tech systems fail, the human system of trust and rank holds the line. We see this as a discipline: just like an emergency response team, we practice it until it’s second nature.
