A cornerstone of this doctrine is an uncompromising separation between our endorsement process and any commercial interests. We call this the **Vendor Sponsorship Firewall** – a set of rules and structural safeguards that ensure no gear manufacturer, retailer, or sponsor can buy or corrupt an FPA endorsement. At the same time, we maintain professional and transparent relationships with vendors who align with our ethics, to benefit our members. Below is how we balance openness with strict ethical walls:  
- **No Pay-to-Play Listings:** Simply put, **no company can pay for a spot on our Approved Gear List.** All listings must be earned via the lifecycle process, regardless of brand or size. We do not accept money, favors, or advertising contracts in exchange for reviewing or endorsing a product. Vendors frequently approach us offering sponsorships or affiliate deals – these are politely declined or only accepted in ways that don’t influence our content (for example, a general donation to the Alliance that is transparently logged and confers zero say in what we endorse). Members are strictly prohibited from soliciting gifts or payment in exchange for pushing a gear tip or review. Any attempt to do so is considered a grave breach of trust.
