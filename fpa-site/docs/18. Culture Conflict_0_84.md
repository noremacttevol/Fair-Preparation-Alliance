Mentorship and Coaching: When conflicts reveal that someone lacks certain skills (communication, emotional regulation, cultural sensitivity), we try to provide help. A senior member might mentor the individual, or we may sponsor them to attend a workshop (like on diversity and inclusion if that was an issue). The message is: we invest in you to get better because we value you. Of course, this goes hand in hand with expectation of improvement – it’s not indulgence, but support with accountability. If someone continually refuses help or doesn’t improve, then we must take further action, but at least we exhaust options to remediate first.
