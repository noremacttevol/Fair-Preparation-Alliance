- **Operational Communications ("Ops Comm")**: Not to be confused with Comms & Outreach which handles messaging and PR, Ops Comm within Core Coordination is the **command-level communication** channel. It’s the secured lines (via the app or radio or meetings) where leaders talk to leaders. Core Coordination sets protocols for these communications. For instance, they establish a daily brief: every regional coordinator sends a quick status report up to national Core by 1800 each day. Or during an emergency, they set who reports to whom every hour. They have comms discipline like “no unsolicited chatter on command net” – ensuring when something comes through, it’s important. They ensure redundancy too: if the main app channel fails, they have a phone tree or radio net as backup. Essentially, they guarantee that **information flow at the leadership level** is constant and reliable, because any break there can paralyze the Alliance.
