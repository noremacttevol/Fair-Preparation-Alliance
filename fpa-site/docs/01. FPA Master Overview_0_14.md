Dynamic Pricing Model (Fair & Adaptive Funding)  
FPA’s funding model is designed to be fair, transparent, and adaptive to our growth. We operate on a Dynamic Pricing Model for membership dues that ensures we have the resources needed early on but never become a bloated, money-hoarding organization. The guiding principle: collect only what’s necessary to sustain the Alliance, and not a penny more. Here’s how it works:  
Initial Membership Fee ($5/month): In our formative stage, membership dues are set at $5 USD per member per month. This flat fee remains until we reach a substantial membership (20,000 members). The $5 is intentionally low – roughly the cost of a fancy coffee – because we want commitment, not a financial barrier. It ensures everyone has some skin in the game and helps cover basic operational costs (app maintenance, printing manuals, comms gear for those in need, etc.), but it’s not so high as to deter serious people from joining. Early members benefit from a fixed, low rate while we build critical mass. And importantly, paying even a small amount creates psychological investment – members are more likely to stay involved when they’ve contributed something tangible, even just $5.
