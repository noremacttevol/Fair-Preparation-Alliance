- **Officer Track (O-1 and above):** Parallel to the enlisted ranks, FPA has an **Officer track** for those in higher leadership positions. While enlisted ranks are earned mostly through points and experience, becoming an officer typically requires a **selection process** on top of having sufficient AP. Officers are the strategists, coordinators of large units, and directors of programs. For example, a city chapter might be led by an **O-1 (Lieutenant)** equivalent, a state by an **O-5 (Colonel)** equivalent, and the national alliance by an **O-6 or O-7 (General)** equivalent rank. We use civilian-friendly titles (like “Chapter Director” instead of Colonel) in public, but internally the rank indicates hierarchy.  
- To become an officer, one usually must reach E-6 or E-7 and then be vetted and approved by a board (including other officers and senior enlisted) _or_ be directly commissioned for special expertise (say we have a medical doctor or seasoned logistician join who clearly can lead at a high level – we might fast-track them into an officer role with appropriate training).  
- Officers still accumulate AP like anyone else, but their promotions (O-1 to O-2, etc.) depend more on fulfilling organizational needs and leadership assessments rather than just points. We don’t want a scenario where someone grinds points but lacks people skills and jumps into officer rank – they must prove they can handle leadership.
