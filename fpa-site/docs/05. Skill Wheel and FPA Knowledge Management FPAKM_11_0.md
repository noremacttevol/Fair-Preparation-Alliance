A hallmark of FPA’s approach is an **“offline-first” resilience** mindset – we prepare for worst-case _grid-down_ scenarios. The Skill Wheel system is therefore designed to bridge online and offline worlds, ensuring that each member’s critical information and learning resources are available when they’re needed most, even if power or internet connectivity is lost. This aligns with the FPA [[Offline-First Resilience System]] principle that nothing should rely solely on active internet or electricity.
