**Structure Overview:** The Fair Preparation Alliance is organized as a network of **distributed circles** rather than a traditional top-down pyramid. Each “circle” is a semi-autonomous group with a specific domain or purpose. For example, we might have a **Regional Circle** (members in a geographic area), a **Communications Circle** (focus on radios, mesh networks, info-sharing), a **Logistics Circle** (supplies and resource management), and so on. These circles are empowered to make decisions within their scope without having to ask a central authority for every little thing. It’s our way of decentralizing control while maintaining cohesion – think of it as a team-of-teams. This setup implements “trust over control” structurally: we trust local circles to handle local matters, as outlined in the [[Trust Doctrine]], instead of micromanaging them.
