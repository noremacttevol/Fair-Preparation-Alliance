**Why it was created (problem it solves):** Modern life – and many preparedness measures – rely on electricity (for communication, refrigeration of meds, running tools, etc). A grid failure due to disaster or attack is one of the most crippling scenarios. Generators can help, but fuel may be scarce. Solar energy, however, provides a renewable, quiet, and replenishing power source. This program addresses the **problem of power dependency** by giving members the capability to generate their own electricity. It solves the vulnerability of being in the dark: by leveraging solar, we **lessen the impact of long-term outages** and reduce reliance on fuel supply chains. It also aligns with ethical and practical considerations – using clean energy and not emitting tell-tale generator noise or fumes. In short, this innovation ensures that even if the grid is down for weeks, our community can still operate critical devices and support neighbors. _Solar tech can strengthen energy resilience: individual buildings with solar + storage can keep power on locally even if the centralized grid is disrupted ([Solar and Resilience Basics | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-and-resilience-basics#:~:text=Solar%20energy%20technologies%20can%20play,infrastructure%20when%20it%20is%20needed))._
