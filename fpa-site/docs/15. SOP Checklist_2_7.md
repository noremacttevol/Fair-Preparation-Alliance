9. **Earn a basic certification or skill badge:** The FPA offers (or recognizes) several basic skills certifications – and every member should earn at least one in their early tenure. Examples: complete a **certified First Aid/CPR course**, or get your HAM radio license, or take an online FEMA ICS (Incident Command System) introductory course, or attend a firearms safety class (if appropriate in your context). These are tangible milestones that improve your usefulness to the group. Pick one path that interests you and commit to achieving it. The alliance might award you a badge or patch for it (for instance, an FPA First Aid patch if you show proof of Red Cross first aid certification). This isn’t about the patch itself; it’s about building real capability. By Phase 2, we anticipate every member will have multiple such qualifications so that squads have a diverse skill set. In Phase 1, we’re just getting started – so plant those seeds now. Choose a weekend within the next two months to get at least one cert under your belt. When disaster strikes, those with training step forward – be one of those people.
