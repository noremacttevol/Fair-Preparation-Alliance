The Fair Preparation Alliance **Skill Wheel and Knowledge Management System** is an ambitious initiative that integrates **visual tracking, personalized training, and AI-driven insights** into the fabric of FPA’s operations. By breaking down the vast concept of “being prepared” into tangible skill categories and measurable progress, it empowers members to take charge of their own development and see how each effort they make directly builds their resilience.  
The design – with its colorful wheel graphic, clear percentages, and the member’s personal call sign at the center – reinforces that **preparedness is personal**, yet also part of a larger team effort. Each member’s strengths contribute to the Alliance’s overall strength, and each gap identified is an opportunity for the group to support that member or for that member to improve. In other words, when a member looks at their Skill Wheel, they’re not just seeing _their_ readiness, but also how they plug into the broader preparedness network of FPA.
