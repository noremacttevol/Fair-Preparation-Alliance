OpenAI and AI Governance: OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT, began as a nonprofit with a mission of ensuring AI benefits all humanity. It created an unusual governance structure (a capped-profit model under nonprofit oversight) to balance innovation with public good. As OpenAI scaled and pursued funding, it faced pressure to become more like a conventional tech company, raising concerns that its original altruistic mission could be compromised. The turbulence at OpenAI (leadership changes, debates over profit vs. safety) holds a mirror to what FPA could experience if it grows: the tension between staying true to an ideal (fairness, community control) and the lure or need for resources and growth that might invite corporate or political influence. The lesson here is about governance and values lock-in. FPA should, early on, define its governance model – perhaps as a nonprofit or cooperative – to protect its mission from being derailed if large donors or external partners come aboard. OpenAI’s story also underscores the importance of benefiting all of humanity vs. enriching a few, a dynamic directly relevant to “fair preparation.” FPA must guard against becoming elitist (only serving those who can pay for premium services, for instance) or being hijacked by a subset of members for their own gain. In terms of AI use, if FPA employs AI (for scenario planning, for example), it should adhere to ethical guidelines akin to those OpenAI professes – avoiding bias, ensuring AI
