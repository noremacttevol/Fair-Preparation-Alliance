A: The term “SHTF Bible” refers to a comprehensive compilation of survival knowledge and training material within FPA – essentially a master reference or curriculum for skills. It’s likely a nickname for the alliance’s guidebook or library (maybe the “Whole Book” or something similar in their files) that covers everything from basic to advanced preparedness skills. The “SHTF Bible” might be organized into modules or chapters (e.g., food & water, shelter, medical, security, communications, etc.) and include checklists, how-to guides, and best practices vetted by the community. It serves as the foundation for FPA’s Skills Training System: members progress through learning these sections, perhaps even logging their proficiency. Some chapters may turn sections of the “Bible” into hands-on training sessions or workshops. For example, the chapter on outdoor survival might be paired with a weekend camping exercise. The idea is that any member can refer to this compendium to learn a skill or refresh knowledge. It might exist as a physical binder for some, a PDF for others, and possibly as an interactive online tool or wiki that FPA updates over time (Mk1Mod3 suggests revisions happen). By calling it a “Bible,” it underscores its importance and breadth – it’s almost like scripture for preppers in the alliance, containing hard-earned wisdom and standard operating procedures. It’s also an equalizer: new members can catch up by studying it, and veteran members contribute to it, ensuring
