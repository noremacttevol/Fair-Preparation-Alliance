**AI Assistance and App Integration:** Mk1Mod3 leverages technology more smartly. We have an upgraded **FPA App** that now integrates an AI assistant (Chapter 9). In day-to-day use, this means members can access a knowledge base or get recommendations quickly (even offline, since key data and AI logic are stored on-device). For example, if facing a water sanitation issue, a member can ask the app’s AI for guidance drawn from our SHTF Bible data. This was not present in Mk1Mod2 at all – it’s a new operational tool. The AI also helps leadership by crunching incoming reports and suggesting priorities, essentially augmenting our decision-making under pressure. Importantly, we’ve configured the system to work with limited connectivity: the AI can function in “offline mode” with pre-downloaded models if needed, and will sync updates when back online. This tech integration provides a force multiplier that was lacking before.  
**Dynamic Resource Management:** Another operational enhancement is how we manage supplies and logistics via dynamic pricing and inventories (see Chapter 10). The new logic in our system monitors supply levels of critical items and can suggest*(This is **Part 2** of the Mk1Mod3 Handbook draft, continuing from Part 1. It includes Chapters 9–12 and the Appendix.)*
