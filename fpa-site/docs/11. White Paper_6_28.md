- Store the gear in a central, secure location (see Milestone 10’s base). If that’s not possible, distribute among members’ homes but keep track of who holds what. Ensure everyone knows how to use each item – a shiny generator is useless if no one can operate it, so perhaps hold a “gear day” to familiarize the squad with everything.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If essential gear cannot be acquired in time (e.g., winter is coming and you have no space heaters or blankets for a warming center idea), have a plan B: know the location of the nearest public shelter or warming station set up by authorities. In an extreme scenario, the squad might focus more on guiding people to external help rather than direct action, until gear is built up. Always plan around what you _do_ have, not what you wish for. If lacking something critical, note it and work with partner organizations (maybe the Red Cross can cover first aid, etc.). Also avoid hoarding syndrome – store what you need for community response, not to outfit an army. Space and resources are limited; lean efficiency is part of being realistic.
