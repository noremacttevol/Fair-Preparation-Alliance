- **Innovation & R&D:** A portion of this content family is always looking ahead. They scan for new technologies that could help FPA and test them. Could cheap **LoRa text messengers** be given to every member for backup comms? Is there a role for **blockchain** in our audit trail or supply chain management? Can we utilize any **open-source intelligence (OSINT)** tools to better predict crises? The R&D folks experiment and then report to Core Coordination and Governance on potential adoption. They keep us **ahead of the curve** technology-wise, to face evolving threats. But they also stay pragmatic – any tech we adopt must meet the resilience test (useful offline, easy to train, won’t backfire if partially broken).  
- **Tech Support & Training:** Lastly, the Tech family provides support to members. They produce user-friendly manuals and how-to videos for the app and devices. They might run a helpdesk (especially as older or less tech-savvy members join, ensuring _everyone_ can use the tools – no one left behind due to a tech gap). They also organize training sessions on topics like “Radio Communications 101”, “Setting up your Outernet Kit”, or “Cybersecurity for Preppers”. This overlaps with Readiness & Drills for execution, but Tech provides the content expertise. In essence, they not only build the tools, they teach the Alliance how to use them effectively.
