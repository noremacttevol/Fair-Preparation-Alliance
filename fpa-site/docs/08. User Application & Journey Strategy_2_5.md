Phase1 establishes a solid base: a small, **high-trust community** of users, all personally vetted, who have the tools to engage both online and offline. The focus is on manual, **human-guided operation** to gather feedback and prove the concept. It also seeds the culture by enforcing quality (through manual acceptance) and encouraging each new member to embrace FPAâ€™s values and offline readiness habits from day one.
