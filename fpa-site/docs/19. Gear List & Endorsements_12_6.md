By following these audit and log templates, FPA members create a paper trail (both literally and digitally) that backs up every endorsement with hard data and documented integrity. In an audit (internal or even external), we can show exactly how a product went from tip to endorsed or rejected, and every influence or check along the way. It’s work, but it’s work that saves time, money, and maybe lives in the end.
