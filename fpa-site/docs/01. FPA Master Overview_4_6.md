- **Scalability & Inter-Alliance Cooperation:** At full capability, FPA can scale to national or even international reach. We have the structure to manage hundreds of thousands of members if it came to it, divided logically into regions and cells that each maintain autonomy under the Alliance principles. Phase3 also opens the door to working with other groups. Because of our efficient structure, we can integrate or collaborate with local CERT teams, volunteer firefighter units, or international prepper organizations. We remain the FPA, but in a major catastrophe, our systems could plug into a larger humanitarian effort (always with caution to maintain our independence and data security). Our technology and approach could even be shared as an **open-source resilience blueprint** for communities worldwide. By Phase3, we are confident and robust enough to influence positive change beyond our own membership.
