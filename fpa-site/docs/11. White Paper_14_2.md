- Train the participating squads on setting up the receiver. Do an initial run-through on a clear day so they gain confidence. Emphasize basics like aiming the antenna, checking signal quality, and saving received files.  
- Include printed troubleshooting tips and a contact (radio frequency or phone if available) for support during the pilot.  
- Run the pilot for a set period (e.g., 3 months) and collect feedback via radio or post-event surveys: Was the signal reliable? Was the info useful? What improvements do users suggest?
**Contingency Plan:** If the Outernet equipment proves too finicky or fails in the field, prepare an alternative means to deliver the same info. For instance, parallel to the satellite feed, have one squad relay the same content over HF radio in data mode as a backup. If the pilot region experiences an actual disaster during the test, be ready to pivot the Outernet feed to live emergency use (a trial by fire). Conversely, if the satellite broadcast is delayed or unreachable due to technical issues, immediately inform squads via HAM that Outernet is down and revert to traditional radio bulletins. Also, keep a fallback paper method: distribute key content (like hurricane safety charts) in advance in printed form to pilot squads, so even if the new tech falters, the knowledge isnâ€™t lost.
