**What’s already implemented (current wins):** We rolled out a beta version of the **Merit Dashboard** 8 weeks ago, and the response has been fantastic. Over 300 members have logged in to check their points, and we’ve seen a **50% uptick in training participation** (attributed to members wanting to earn the “Training Streak” badge). Friendly competition has taken off – e.g., the Northeast Region ran a “September Prep Quest” contest via our app, where squads competed in weekly challenges (like water purification drills) for points. More importantly, **engagement in serious tasks has increased**: our knowledge base contributions grew as members earned points for adding SOP content. The gamified approach has **transformed engagement from passive to active** – a big win for FPA’s mission.
