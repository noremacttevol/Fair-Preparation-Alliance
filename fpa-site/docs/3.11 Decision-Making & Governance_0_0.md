FPA emphasizes collaborative governance that balances quick decision-making with member input. In normal operations, decisions (like planning an event or changing a protocol) are discussed openly in meetings or forums, and the coordinating council synthesizes input to reach a consensus or majority vote as needed. Critical decisions, such as allocating emergency funds or initiating a major response, follow a predefined protocol: for example, a quorum of council members can authorize urgent actions. Transparency is key â€“ meeting notes or decisions are logged in the knowledge base for all members to review. By having a governance structure in place, FPA avoids chaos and infighting, especially during an emergency when decisive leadership may be required. However, members also trust that peacetime decisions incorporate their voices and that leadership roles are accountable and rotate or re-elect periodically to prevent stagnation.
