- Offer roles or tasks that cater to different abilities: someone who can’t lift heavy stuff might handle radio comms or planning; a youth might manage social media communications; an elderly member could be the historian/record-keeper. Show that **every skill is valued**. Publicly appreciate contributions of all types.  
- Keep an open-door segment in meetings: explicitly state that any neighbor is welcome to attend and observe or join. When newcomers attend, take a moment to introduce the squad and recap past actions so they’re not lost. Possibly maintain a short “About FPA & Our Squad” handout to give them (including how to get the FPA Dictionary if they want to read up on terminology).
