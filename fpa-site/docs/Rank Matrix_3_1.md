- **E-4 (Operator):** Put your comms gear to use in a practical way â€“ **establish direct communication with another member** in an emergency-communication context. For instance, you coordinate a scheduled radio check or exchange a prepared message with a fellow member using your equipment (or an alternate emergency channel). This proves you can actually get a message through to your network when needed. _(AP: points for completing a two-way comms test and logging it in the system.)_  
- **E-5 (Technician):** Earn an **FCC Amateur Radio license** (Technician class or equivalent) by studying and passing the HAM radio exam. This certifies your commitment to communication readiness and legally empowers you to use a wide range of radio frequencies during emergencies. Reaching E-5 means you have both the knowledge and credentials to be an effective radio operator for the Alliance. _(AP: significant points for achieving a public certification; you likely also participate in a group radio net as practice.)_  
By the end of E-5, an FPA member has a solid personal preparedness plan, basic supplies, a working knowledge of emergency protocols, and effective communication capability (with proper licensing). These core skills lay the groundwork for more advanced, field-oriented challenges in the next tier of ranks.
