- Best practices from the **FPA Compass Guide** are directly incorporated. If the Compass Guide has a recommended checklist for, say, community damage assessment, we adopt that and tailor it, citing it as “Compass Guide – Damage Assessment Checklist.” This assures we’re not deviating from proven methods unless necessary. If we discover an improvement, we document it and plan to feed it back to the Compass Guide authors, completing the loop of refinement.  
- Phase 1 deliverables (like any compiled risk assessment or training curricula from Batch 1) are continuously referenced to keep Phase 2 grounded. For example, if Phase 1 identified flood as top risk and created a prep kit list, Phase 2 milestones explicitly build on that (milestones about flood drills, stockpiling items from that list). And as we get to Phase 3, this Phase 2 document itself will be a reference point for the broader roadmap, ensuring seamless continuity. Essentially, we treat this Phase 2 guide as a chapter in the larger Mk1Mod3 series – it stands alone as a tactical guide for implementation now, and it will plug into Phase 3’s strategy for scaling beyond local.
