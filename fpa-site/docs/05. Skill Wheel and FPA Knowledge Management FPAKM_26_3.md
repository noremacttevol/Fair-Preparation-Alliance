4. **Technical Reliability (Offline/Online Sync):** The utility of the system in a crisis depends on it being accessible offline. If our sync mechanisms fail, or if a disaster strikes before the latest data was transmitted, members might be looking at outdated info. **Mitigations:** Redundancy and tolerance for staleness are key. We design the offline materials (binder printouts, etc.) to be useful even without frequent updates – they focus on fundamental principles that don’t change rapidly (first aid steps, contact lists) more than ephemeral data. If a member’s printed wheel isn’t updated for a few months, that’s usually fine; their core skills likely haven’t radically changed, and having something is better than nothing. We will thoroughly test the Outernet and other sync channels during calm periods (e.g., incorporate it into drills: simulate the internet down and practice using only our radio/Outernet updates). We also maintain backup comms methods: if the satellite fails, maybe we switch to HF radio broadcasts of critical info, or even a phone tree to disseminate urgent messages. And we encourage each member to _also_ keep their own analog notes of training (like a simple log in their binder) just in case – an “offline-first” habit where high-tech augments but does not replace low-tech preparedness.
