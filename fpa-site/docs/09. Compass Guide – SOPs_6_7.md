- **“Offline First” Preparedness:** Everything we do has a redundant, offline fallback. The fancy app, the cloud database, the websites – those are conveniences. But if the power and internet go out (and we plan as if they will), the FPA still operates. We insist on old-school backups: **HAM radios** for communication when phones die, printed **SOP manuals** and SHTF Bible excerpts for when websites aren’t reachable, physical maps when GPS is down, and clear human command chains for when we can’t teleconference. This philosophy is summed up in our internal saying: _“No phone? Radio works. No server? Printed ops ready. No internet? Outernet live. No leader? Squad adapts fast.”_ In practice, we hold regular drills where we simulate “grid-down” conditions – no one can use electronics, and we see how well plans hold up. By doing that, we identify weak points and fix them. We choose this approach because history shows critical systems fail in major crises. If your preparedness plan lives in a smartphone app or in your head alone, it’s fragile. The FPA way is to have layers: tech where available, muscle memory and paper where not. It’s more work to maintain two of everything (e.g., updating a digital plan and printing copies), but it’s worth it. You’ll thank us the day a solar flare wipes out half the electronics – your solar charger might fry, but that laminated water-purification guide in your pocket will still save your life.
