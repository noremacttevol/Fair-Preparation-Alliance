- **Empowering & Inclusive:** FPA’s narrative frames the _audience as protagonists_. We don’t talk down to “victims” — we speak to **citizens, neighbors, families**, and _fellow guardians_ of their community. Our language invites participation: “_Join us in securing our neighborhood_…” or “_Your knowledge could save someone’s life tomorrow._” We celebrate local initiative and make it clear that everyone has a role. The tone is inclusive across backgrounds, education levels, and technical know-how. We use plain language, avoiding jargon unless we immediately explain it or it’s part of necessary training (and even then, we include a quick definition from our FPA Dictionary for clarity).
