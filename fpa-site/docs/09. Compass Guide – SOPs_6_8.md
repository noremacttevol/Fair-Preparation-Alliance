- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** We codify best practices into checklists and drills so that every member knows _exactly_ what’s expected. From day one, you’ll have a **Personal SOP Checklist** (a step-by-step to get yourself up to speed – see the **[[Personal SOP Checklist]]** note) and your squad will follow **Team SOPs** for group activities. Why so formal? Because when chaos hits, you fall back on training. Having written SOPs that everyone follows means we react faster and more cohesively under stress. It removes ambiguity – instead of debating what to do during a wildfire evacuation, you already have a plan and each person a role, as laid out in the SOP. These procedures are living documents; we improve them continuously as we learn. But we’ve seen them work: for example, one of our squads followed the playbook during a sudden blackout – everyone knew who would get the generator, who would check on the elderly neighbor, where the rendezvous point was – all predetermined. The crisis went from panic to a coordinated response in minutes, _because of SOPs_. We design our SOPs to be realistic (no superhuman tasks), modular (adaptable to different scenarios), and straightforward (checklists, not convoluted manuals). By internalizing them, you gain confidence – you _know_ what to do and that your teammates do too. This discipline is what separates effective preparedness groups from ad-hoc crowds.
