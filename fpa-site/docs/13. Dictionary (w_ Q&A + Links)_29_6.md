Q5: What does “fair preparation” mean in the context of FPA?
A: “Fair preparation” is the idea that emergency preparedness should be ethical and equitable. In the FPA context, it means prepping in a way that doesn’t harm or exploit others. For example, members share knowledge and resources openly rather than hoarding secrets or supplies. They believe everyone deserves a chance to be prepared, not just those with money or inside information. Fair preparation also means treating others decently even during crises – not stealing or taking advantage of vulnerable people. It’s about doing your part to help your community while you prepare yourself. In short, FPA’s concept of fair preparation is prepping with a conscience: being ready for disasters without losing your humanity or sense of justice. [#Beginner] [#Doctrine]
