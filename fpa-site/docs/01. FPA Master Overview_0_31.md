FPA App Development & Maintenance: Tech & App Dev are the custodians of the FPA App introduced in Phase2. They write the code, squash the bugs, and push updates. The app is a multifaceted tool: it provides secure messaging, event scheduling, a library of resources (manuals, how-to guides, maps), an SOS alert feature, and modules for logging activities and AP points. This team ensures the app remains offline-first and secure. For example, they designed the database to run locally on phones with sync protocols that work over any network available (Wi-Fi, cellular, mesh, even acoustic modems over radio). They implement strong encryption (leveraging robust open-source cryptography) so that if a device is captured, without the member’s keys it yields nothing. By Phase3, the app includes advanced AI capabilities – Tech & App Dev makes sure those models run locally as well, so advice is available off-grid. They take constant user feedback and iterate quickly, adding features that field members need. Essentially, they treat the app as a lifeline for members and harden it to work under disaster conditions.
