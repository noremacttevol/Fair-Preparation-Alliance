The Alliance operates with a flat but clearly defined organizational structure to maximize both efficiency and empowerment. There is typically a coordinating council or leadership team (e.g., regional coordinators, a communications lead, a training lead) that guides overall strategy and logistics. Beneath the council, members often organize into functional teams or local chapters, but hierarchy is minimal â€“ each member has a voice and can take initiative within guidelines. This structure provides stability (with designated points of contact for various tasks) while remaining flexible enough to adapt during emergencies when strict hierarchies may break down.
