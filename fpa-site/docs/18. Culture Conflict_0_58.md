Through movement-level critique and reflection, we embed a culture that welcomes critique as fuel for resilience. It ensures that we do not become complacent or blind to internal faults. By confronting issues head-on at a movement scale, we inoculate ourselves against sudden collapse; potential points of fragmentation are identified in advance and solutions enacted collectively, rather than let to fester into irreconcilable schisms.
