**Lessons Learned:** Early on, some teams struggled with setting up the gear – aligning a satellite patch antenna isn’t as plug-and-play as hoped. We learned to provide **printed** step-by-step guides and pre-calibrated settings for quicker setup. We also discovered that content needs to be tightly prioritized; the pilot initially sent too much data (news articles, etc.), which overwhelmed users. After trimming to essentials (alerts, maps, and one-page guides), squads reported the feed was far more useful. The pilot confirmed Outernet’s promise, while highlighting the need for user training and content curation.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Choose the pilot region based on risk and readiness (e.g., high-disaster area with at least one tech-oriented squad). Seek local buy-in from squads excited to try new tech.  
- Acquire or assemble Outernet receiver kits (satellite antenna, receiver board, Raspberry Pi or similar). If budget is tight, start with one kit and rotate it among squads for practice.  
- Coordinate with the Outernet service provider (or volunteer engineers) to set up a dedicated data channel for FPA content. Schedule a modest daily broadcast (e.g., 10 MB of data at a set time).  
- Develop a content plan for the pilot: for example, morning and evening updates containing any new alerts, one or two PDF guides (first aid tips of the day), and any urgent messages from FPA leadership.
