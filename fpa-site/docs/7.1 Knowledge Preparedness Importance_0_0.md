Beyond physical prepping, knowledge preparedness is a core pillar of FPA. The Alliance believes that what you know can be just as critical as what you have. In a crisis, knowing how to purify water, treat an injury, fix a generator, or grow food can save lives when supplies are limited. Thus, members are encouraged to stockpile not only goods but also information. This means both learning skills ahead of time and having references available when needed. Knowledge preparedness covers broad areas: practical skills (first aid, navigation, mechanics), local intel (hazard maps, community contacts), and meta-knowledge (knowing where to find information under duress). FPA equates an updated manual or a heads-up on pending danger as a form of prepping "supply." Emphasis is placed on training – workshops and drills are essentially building up knowledge stores in people’s minds. Furthermore, the Alliance’s attitude is that knowledge is one of the most portable preps: if you memorize how to start a fire in wet conditions or how to improvise a shelter, you carry that ability anywhere. They also stress adapting knowledge to circumstances; for example, some survival techniques differ in urban vs wilderness settings, so having that contextual awareness is important. All members are thus both students and teachers at various times. In sum, FPA actively prepares in the knowledge domain by learning, practicing, documenting, and sharing – ensuring that when challenges arise, they face them
