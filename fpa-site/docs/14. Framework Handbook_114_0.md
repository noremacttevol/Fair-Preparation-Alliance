Official forecasts confirm Hurricane Lucia’s path toward the city. FPA’s systems kick into high gear _before_ the storm:  
- **Early Alerts & Squad Prep:** Through the FPA App, all members in the area get a hurricane watch notification. Squads immediately organize via group chat and radio. They review relevant SOPs (hurricane prep, flood prep) and divvy up tasks. For instance, Squad 7’s leader coordinates boarding up windows for an elderly neighbor, the Medic checks everyone’s first aid supplies, and the Logistics Officer makes sure each household has enough water and food for at least two weeks. Shortfalls are identified (one family has no generator and a medical device that needs power). The chapter’s dynamic inventory shows a spare generator available, which is delivered to that family using points (free for them due to medical need).  
- **Community Outreach:** Trust Doctrine in action – squads don’t just look inward. They knock on doors in their vicinity to ensure neighbors (even non-FPA) know the storm is coming and have basic plans. They hand out printed emergency tip sheets (from the SHTF Bible) on what to do and city evacuation routes. This builds goodwill and may very well save lives. Some neighbors, impressed by the organization, decide to join the FPA network later.
