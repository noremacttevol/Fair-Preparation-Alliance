- **Tribunal or Specialized Committee Membership:** The most trusted and experienced Phase IV members may be invited to join the **Tribunal** or other oversight bodies. The Tribunal (detailed later in Trust Doctrine) is essentially our high council for ethics and disputes. Having seasoned operators on it is crucial so decisions are grounded in field reality. Phase IV leaders could also chair committees (for example, a **Training Committee** to refine progression plans, or a **Tech Committee** to oversee app developments in line with member needs).  
- **Continuing Education & Adaptability:** Even at Phase IV, learning never stops. Leaders are expected to stay updated on new threats, technologies, and strategies. They might attend advanced external courses or lead internal wargames. We emphasize humility â€“ a leader must be willing to learn from anyone, including junior members, and to admit mistakes (especially under the transparency log system).  
- **Succession and Scaling:** A Phase IV leader also has a duty to cultivate new leaders (back to mentorship). They identify promising Phase II/III members and give them opportunities to lead portions of drills or administrative tasks. This ensures if a leader steps down or an emergency requires quick expansion (forming new squads), there are prepared people to step up. In essence, Phase IV involves not just leading, but **building leadership capacity** in others.
