Why this matters: In a resilient organization, accountability and psychological safety go hand in hand. FPA strives for that blend: high standards and high safety. Harvard research by Amy Edmondson and others has shown that the most effective teams are those with both candor and mutual respect. If we only had safety without accountability, we might become complacent; if only accountability without safety, we’d breed fear. So we deliberately cultivate both. Over a century, this means FPA will maintain excellence (because members don’t let each other off the hook on values or performance) and maintain trust (because they do so from a place of care, not fear).
