- **Gear Endorsements and Standardization:** The Gear Endorsements doctrine (and associated lists) are essentially our approved toolkit for survival. This communications plan leans heavily on gear, so aligning with endorsements is essential. When we recommend a certain radio model or Faraday bag, those are likely drawn from the Gear Endorsements list which tests for reliability and interoperability. By using endorsed gear, we ensure compatibility across the Alliance – for instance, if everyone has at least the endorsed handheld radio, we know its capabilities and limitations and can train uniformly. Endorsed solar chargers mean most members have similar DC setups which simplifies support (like carrying spare parts that fit multiple units, or standardizing on 12V). This doctrine explicitly refers members to those endorsements when upgrading equipment to meet EMP protection or comm needs. It also provides feedback to Gear Endorsements: if in drills we find a certain device consistently fails or a new device performs exceptionally, Phase 4 comms leaders will recommend updates to the endorsed list. There is also integration in terms of **interoperability standards**: Gear endorsements often specify frequency bands (e.g., endorse GMRS radios for all families, 2m/70cm HAM for squads, etc.). Our comm plans are built around those bands, ensuring that what we plan to use matches gear members actually own. If the endorsements list says “Baofeng UV-5R” (for example) is a common
