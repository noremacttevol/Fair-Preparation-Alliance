Q27: What does “two is one, one is none” mean in prepping?
A: It’s a popular saying in prepping (and the military) about the importance of backups. “Two is one, one is none” means that if you have only one of a critical item and it breaks or gets lost, then effectively you have none when you need it. But if you have two of that item, you have a backup – so if one fails, you still have one left. In practice, preppers use this philosophy to build redundancy into their gear and plans. For example, you might carry two flashlights, two ways to start fire, or duplicate copies of important documents. It’s a reminder not to rely on a single point of failure. By having a spare (or an alternate method), you greatly increase your reliability in an emergency. [#Beginner] [#Logistics]
