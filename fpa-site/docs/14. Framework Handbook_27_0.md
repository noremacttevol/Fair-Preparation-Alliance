FPA defines operational readiness in **four major levels** (plus the initial joining stage). Below is a summary of each level, typical requirements, and capabilities. These levels correspond broadly to increasing self-sufficiency and leadership within the alliance:  
|**Level**|**Title & Focus**|**Description of Readiness**|
|---|---|---|
|**Level 1**|**Basic Preparedness** (Individual/Household)|**Focus:** Personal and household readiness basics. **Requirements:** Complete FPA orientation and basic training modules (covering fundamentals of first aid, fire safety, emergency communications etiquette, etc.). Assemble a personal 72-hour emergency kit for self and family. Understand and pledge to the Trust Doctrine. Join a squad and participate in at least one squad drill or meeting. **Capabilities:** Can sustain oneself (and dependents) for at least 3 days without outside help. Knows how to execute basic SOPs under guidance. Essentially, a Level 1 member is not reliant on others for short-term survival and can be an asset (not a liability) to their squad in initial response.|
