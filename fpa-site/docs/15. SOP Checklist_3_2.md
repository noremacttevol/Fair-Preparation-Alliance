**Using AP for promotion opportunities:** Your rank in the FPA structure (E-1 through E-9) determines what roles you can take. As a newcomer (E-1) you’re in learning mode. Hitting E-2 and E-3 shows you’re proficient in basics and reliable – at that point you might be trusted to lead a small team for a task or manage a specific resource. By E-4 or E-5, you’re in chapter leadership territory (maybe becoming an assistant squad leader or training coordinator). So climbing ranks opens doors to more influence and responsibility. The Alliance Points system is the ladder. Community benefit and personal growth go hand-in-hand here: the more you do for the FPA, the more authority the FPA gives you to do even more good.  
One cool aspect: AP resets _never_. Your points accumulate across your entire FPA career. Even when you hit a new rank, the excess points carry over. And if we ever need to implement something like commendations or awards, those can translate into bonus AP. Long-term, Phase 3 might bring in AI analysis to ensure AP corresponds tightly with actual impact (to refine point values, etc.), but Phase 1 is straightforward – humans tracking human contributions.
