During a chaotic situation, leaders can be overwhelmed with information and choices. FPA integrates AI in the form of decision support systems to help weigh options and project outcomes. Think of it as having a super-fast analyst at the table: given the current situation data (e.g., available people, weather forecast, resource status, and objectives), an AI system can suggest possible courses of action and highlight pros/cons of each. For example, if a wildfire is approaching, the system might lay out: Option A (stay and shelter with these preparations) vs Option B (evacuate to location X), and feed in factors like travel time, fire spread models, and member vulnerabilities to rank which is safer. These AIs often use techniques from game theory or multi-criteria analysis to not just pick the “optimal” solution, but also show how sensitive the outcomes are to certain assumptions (like “if the wind shifts unexpectedly, Plan B becomes riskier”). FPA uses these tools as second opinions; they don’t blindly follow the AI, but it surfaces things humans might overlook. For instance, the AI might point out that a certain bridge is a single point of failure for evacuation and suggest an alternate route—something a stressed leader might not recall. In training, the Alliance might run scenarios through the decision support system to learn and improve their own decision-making. Importantly, they also train when to disregard AI suggestions (for example, if the AI lacks fresh data on a
