- **The SHTF Manual & Knowledge Base:** Readiness & Drills curates the **SHTF Manual** – essentially the Bible of prepping and crisis response tailored to FPA. It’s a living document, updated with lessons learned and new techniques. They ensure every member has access to it (physical copy and digital). They also maintain the **FPA Q&A Knowledge Base**, which might be an FAQ-style repository of all common questions and best answers about Alliance procedures and prepping know-how. This content family uses these resources to educate – for instance, a member asks “What do I do if power grid fails in winter?” The knowledge base has a clear, vetted answer with steps and references to training material. The Readiness team makes sure information is consistent across all channels – no conflicting advice. And they strongly encourage members to actually read and carry key excerpts of the SHTF Manual. Many squads require their members to pass a quiz on each chapter to earn AP and prove they read it.
