|**Logistics Officer**|Manages supplies, equipment, and logistics. This member tracks the squad’s inventory of essentials: food, water, fuel, batteries, tools, and so forth. They plan resupply strategies and rotation of perishable stocks. During operations, the Logistics Officer figures out how to get needed resources from point A to B (for example, setting up a carpool to transport evacuees or allocating fuel usage among generators). They work closely with the Squad Leader to prioritize resource use and with other squads to trade supplies if needed.|
|**Engineer/Technician** (if available)|Maintains technical equipment and infrastructure. Not every squad will have a dedicated engineer, but it’s a huge asset if someone has mechanical or trade skills. This person looks after generators, water purification systems, solar panels, or any specialized gear. They handle repairs (e.g., fixing a broken water pump) and improvise solutions on the fly (like rigging antennas or patching up a leaky roof). They also advise the group on fortifying structures and improving self-sufficiency (for instance, building a rainwater catchment system).|
