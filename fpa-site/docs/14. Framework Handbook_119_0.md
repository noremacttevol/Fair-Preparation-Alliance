Over time, FPA has refined its terminology for clarity and consistency. Here are some legacy terms from Mk1Mod2 and their Mk1Mod3 equivalents for reference:  
- **“Prepper Cell” or “Team” (Mk1Mod2)** – Now referred to as a **“Squad”** in Mk1Mod3. We standardized on “squad” to describe our primary small unit, replacing various terms.  
- **Member “Code of Conduct”** – Evolved into the **Trust Doctrine**. The principles are similar (integrity, mutual support), but now formalized and expanded.  
- **“SOP Playbook”** – Now the **SOP Compass Guide**. The new name reflects the navigational aid concept and unified procedures.  
- **FPA “Prepper Library”** – Now consolidated as the **SHTF Bible** knowledge base.  
- **“Comms Plan”** (communications plan) – Incorporated into the **Offline-First Infrastructure Blueprint**, covering all comms and power plans.  
- **Gear “Exchange”** – Now the **Approved Gear List & Dynamic Pricing System**, highlighting the shift from informal swaps to a structured fair marketplace.  
- **“Volunteer Group”** (generic use) – We often just say **“Alliance”** or refer to local units as **“Chapters”** now, to emphasize affiliation with FPA’s network.
