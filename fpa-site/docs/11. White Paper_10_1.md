**Actionable Steps:**  
- Define approximately 10 regions covering the nation.  
- Select or form one squad in each region to serve as the relay hub.  
- Assign clear duties: each relay squad monitors their region’s communications and connects with other regional relays daily or as needed.  
- Provide relay squads with enhanced communication gear and training for long-distance networking.  
- Publish a regional map and roster so all FPA members know which relay squad covers their area and how to reach it.  
- Establish a regular schedule where all relay squads practice passing information across the chain, coast-to-coast.  
- Pair new relay squads with veteran radio mentors from Phase 2 to accelerate their learning curve in managing multi-hop communication.
**Contingency Plan:** If a region lacks an obvious squad to take the relay role, temporarily assign that responsibility to an adjacent region’s relay squad until a local team is ready. Have at least one backup squad per region trained to assume relay functions if the primary is overwhelmed or offline. In case of political or infrastructure disruptions in one region (e.g., a state government impedes volunteer comms), other relay squads will increase coverage overlap to ensure no region goes dark. Additionally, maintain a simple _relay playbook_ on paper so any squad can step up as an interim relay if original plans fall through.
