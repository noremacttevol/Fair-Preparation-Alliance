**Action Steps:**  
- **Enroll in a CERT course:** Find your local CERT program (start at FEMA’s website or ask local fire department). CERT Basic Training is usually ~20 hours total, often spread over a few evenings or a weekend, and **typically free**. Sign up and complete the course. It covers disaster medical ops, fire suppression, search & rescue, and team organization. If CERT isn’t available, at least take a Red Cross First Aid/CPR class (many Red Cross chapters do low-cost or free training days).  
- **Practice “Stop the Bleed” and CPR:** These are two critical skills for trauma. Many areas offer _Stop the Bleed_ classes (often free at hospitals) where you learn to apply tourniquets and pack wounds. CPR classes might cost a bit (~$50 for certification) but check for community-sponsored sessions (sometimes free for volunteers or students). At minimum, watch free instructional videos from reputable sources and practice on a pillow or dummy if you can. The goal is that you can handle heavy bleeding and cardiac arrest – top killers in disasters.
