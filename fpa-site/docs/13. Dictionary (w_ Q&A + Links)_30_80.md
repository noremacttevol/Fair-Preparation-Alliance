A: FPA is inclusive in its approach to preparedness, recognizing that not everyone can run with a 50lb pack or build a shelter. For members with limited mobility or disabilities, the alliance tailors plans to their needs. They emphasize team and community support: for example, a local chapter will coordinate so that in an evacuation or disaster, people with mobility issues have a buddy (or multiple) assigned to help them. Preplans might involve accessible transportation (like knowing who has a vehicle that can accommodate a wheelchair) and accessible safe locations. FPA’s guide likely has sections on adaptive prepping: like how to stock extra medical supplies (oxygen, medications, etc.), backup power for necessary medical devices, and how to handle scenarios like a power outage for someone who’s bed-bound (maybe having battery backups or manual alternatives). They also encourage those with disabilities to be as involved as possible in other areas – maybe they can’t do heavy lifting, but they can handle communications, planning, or first aid roles. Training events are adapted too: fire drills might include practicing evacuating someone in a wheelchair down stairs with a special carry technique or device. The alliance might seek advice from experts or members who are healthcare professionals on best practices. There’s also an element of advocacy: FPA might push for community resources like registry of disabled residents for first responders (while balancing OPSEC).
