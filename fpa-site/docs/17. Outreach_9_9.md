than directed action. **FPA’s measures:** While missile warnings are (hopefully) rare, the principles apply broadly: we design our alerting and messaging processes to avoid single points of failure. Squad-verified messaging would never allow one person alone to issue something of that magnitude without confirmation. Also, we emphasize **failsafe messaging** – if an incorrect message goes out, we already have secondary channels to immediately counteract it (for example, FPA social media and radio announcements could have been used in Hawaii to say “False Alarm” faster than the official retraction). The incident also underscores why we focus on _education_: had there been a community culture of “here’s what you do if…”, people would have had actions to focus on (get to a basement, etc.) rather than purely panic. It’s the difference between chaos and uneasy order. FPA’s outreach seeks to instill that kind of preparedness so that when any alarm sounds, people _know how to interpret it and respond appropriately_.
