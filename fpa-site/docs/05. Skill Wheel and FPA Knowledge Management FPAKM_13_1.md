Earlier-phase implementations of offline sync will be simpler. For example, we might use QR codes or short data bursts whenever possible: if a member briefly connects to any network, they could scan a QR code on their profile to pull down the latest data. Also, FPA teams deploying to a disaster zone with no internet could, **before leaving**, generate local copies of all team members’ Skill Wheels and guides on a rugged tablet or print them out as a dossier. The system will support exporting a batch of profiles to PDF or another portable format for exactly this scenario.  
Integration with the _SHTF Bible_ is also part of offline strategy. Each skill category on the wheel corresponds to chapters or sections in the Bible. Ideally, the SHTF Bible (which exists in both printed handbook form and as a digital reference) includes self-study material and drills for each of those categories. We will ensure the **Knowledge Management System cross-links content** with the Skill Wheel data. For example, in the app, clicking on your First Aid segment could suggest _“Learn More: SHTF Bible Chapter5 – Basic Trauma Care”_ as further reading. Conversely, while reading the digital SHTF Bible, a member could take a quiz at the end of the chapter with one tap, and that result would feed back into their Skill Wheel. This two-way integration reinforces learning: the knowledge base informs skill improvement, and the skill profile points back to the knowledge needed.
