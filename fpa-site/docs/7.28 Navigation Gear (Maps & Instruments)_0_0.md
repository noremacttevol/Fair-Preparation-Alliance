Navigational capability is backed by essential gear:  
- Maps: Topographic maps of the region, road maps, and city maps are kept in waterproof cases. Each team or family has copies in case they separate. Custom maps marking meetup spots or resources are distributed.  
- Compass: A liquid-filled orienteering compass for each key member, along with knowledge of declination and map use. Also, lensatic compasses for precision (especially among those with land navigation training).  
- GPS Devices: Handheld GPS units (with offline maps loaded) act as handy tools in Phase 1 and 2, but FPA doesn’t rely solely on them. Spare batteries or a 12V car adapter kept as well.  
- Altimeter/Barometer: In mountainous terrain, some carry altimeter watches to aid in navigation and weather prediction (falling pressure indicating storms).  
- Signaling for Navigation: Basic trail marking tape or chalk to leave signs for others, and knowledge of waypoint marking (like cairns or branch arrows) so groups can indicate path taken.
This gear ensures that even if digital navigation fails, members can still find their way, rendezvous, or scout unknown areas effectively. Training is given so that everyone can use map and compass—tech fails are expected, and the Alliance wants no one literally lost in the woods or city.
