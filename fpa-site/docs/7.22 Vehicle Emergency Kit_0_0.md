Since many emergencies involve or affect travel, FPA advises members to keep a Vehicle Emergency Kit in their cars (or other personal vehicles). This kit ensures that if you’re on the road during a crisis (or even just a mundane breakdown), you have the tools and supplies to stay safe, get moving again, or survive until help comes. A well-stocked vehicle kit includes:  
- Car essentials: Jumper cables, a spare tire (in good condition) with jack and tire iron, tire repair kit or fix-a-flat, and a portable air compressor. Fluids like engine oil, coolant, brake fluid – small amounts for topping off if needed.  
- Tools: a wrench, screwdrivers, pliers, duct tape, zip ties, and a multitool – enough for basic repairs or makeshift fixes (like reattaching a loose hose).  
- Recovery and signaling: tow strap, a folding shovel (in winter areas, also kitty litter or sand for traction; in off-road areas, traction mats), and road flares/reflective triangles to signal if you’re broken down. Also a hi-visibility vest.  
- Navigation backup: physical map/atlas of the region in case GPS fails, and a compass. In remote areas, a PLB (personal locator beacon) or satellite messenger might be in the glovebox for true emergencies.  
- Comfort and survival: Blankets (or sleeping bag), extra clothes (consider season; a coat, hat and gloves for winter; sun shade hat for summer), and a few hand warmers. Also an umbrella or poncho for rain.
