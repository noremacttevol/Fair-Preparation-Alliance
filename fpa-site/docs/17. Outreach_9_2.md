was available, information didn’t reach those in need, and needs didn’t reach those who could help. A report labeled it a “classic failure in command and control” ([Katrina Response: A Failure to Communicate - - Hurricane Katrina Lessons](https://veoci.com/blog/katrina-response-a-failure-to-communicate/#:~:text=The%209%2F11%20Public%20Discourse%20Project,failure%20in%20command%20and%20control)), largely due to communications failure. **Lesson learned:** You cannot assume normal comms will work in a disaster, and you _must_ have redundant, decentralized ways to connect. **FPA’s measures:** Our offline-first strategy directly addresses this. By having HAM radio operators, Outernet channels, and analog methods, we ensure that when one link breaks, another takes over. We also emphasize unified incident reporting and communication tracking within our squads, to avoid the “scattered pieces, no one in charge” scenario that plagued Katrina response. Every squad has a clear coordinator, and regionally we map out how information flows so it’s not left to ad-hoc last-minute arrangements. Additionally, after seeing how citizens were desperate for information (some resorted to painting messages on sheets or relying on stray radio broadcasts), FPA underscores print and local broadcast solutions – we _won’t_ leave communities info-starved if we can help it.
