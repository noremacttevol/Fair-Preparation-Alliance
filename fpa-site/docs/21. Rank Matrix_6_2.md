The Prestige Track is subject to the same transparency as other paths. The project details and progress are usually visible to the community, and the final vote ensures everyone agrees the member earned their prestige. If a prestige project requires ongoing involvement (say running the program they created), the member effectively takes on that responsibility similar to an appointed officer, but focused on their specialized area without going into general command.  
In summary, the Prestige Track allows the Alliance to benefit from **innovative and specialized contributions** by its top members who choose not to pursue traditional leadership. It adds flexibility and recognizes that leadership can take many forms – whether it’s leading people (Officer track) or leading ideas and innovation (Prestige track).
