- **Meritocracy, Not Aristocracy:** The rank and AP system is about meritocracy. We reward action, skill, and dedication. But we’re always wary of it turning into an aristocracy of old-timers looking down on rookies. The **culture in FPA** reinforces that a higher rank means _more responsibility to serve_, not privilege to lord over others. Senior members are expected to **mentor** juniors, not boss them around for no reason. With the transparency we maintain, if someone’s pulling rank inappropriately, it gets called out. The Governance & Oversight folks (and frankly everyone) keep an eye on maintaining respect across all levels. The AP and rank structure should **inspire new members** (“look what I can achieve if I work hard”) and **honor veterans** (“look what they’ve done for us”), without building walls between them. We’re all on the same team, just playing different positions based on experience.
