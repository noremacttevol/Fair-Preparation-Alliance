By addressing funding issues, tech reliance, decentralized info, and the possibility of incomplete prep, we aim to make Phase1 **resilient**. The theme of contingencies is redundancy and flexibility: never relying on only one approach, always having a fallback. This way, Phase1 itself embodies the resilience we’re trying to build in every individual member. If Phase1 succeeds – even imperfectly – each member becomes a self-sufficient node of competence, ready to link with others in Phase2.  
_(Phase1 complete. This concludes Batch1: Introduction and Phase1 content. Members should review these sections and confirm understanding before proceeding to Phase2.)_
