- Content was peer-reviewed. We didn’t want snake-oil or myths. The community vetted each section. If someone submitted a method to, say, treat waterborne illness with a herbal remedy, we cross-checked with medical professionals in FPA to validate if it’s actually safe or effective. The goal was to strip out the folklore that pervades some prepper forums and stick to evidence-backed or at least widely accepted practices. Where there are uncertainties, we note them (e.g., “Some sources suggest X; use with caution and consider Y alternative if available”).  
- Diversity of scenarios was considered. We solicited input from members in different regions: urban members, rural homesteaders, coastal communities, etc. This ensured the SHTF Bible isn’t just wilderness survival or just urban prepping, but a blend. City dwellers contributed tips on things like utilizing building rooftops or dealing with high-rise evacuations. Rural members emphasized things like livestock care or firefighting where fire departments are far away.
