Throughout these steps, emphasis is on **positive reinforcement and normalization** of learning. Early communications avoid overwhelming the user – low readiness scores are framed as a starting point, not a failure (e.g. “Everyone starts at rookie level – we’ll get you to the next level together”). This aligns with FPA’s growth-mindset approach to preparedness ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=realistic%20grading%20=%20growth%20mindset:,and%20examples%20of%20others%20who/)).  
- **Offline-First Technical Design:** Phase1 treats offline access as a priority, not an afterthought. The app is built as a Progressive Web App if possible, caching essential content (like the user’s plan, guides, [[SHTF Bible]] excerpts) on the device. All critical data and SOPs are **printable or downloadable** so that members can retain info independently of the app. For example, after completing “Test My Plan,” the results and recommendations can be saved as a PDF. The motto is: _“No internet? Radio works. No app? Print works. No leader? Squad adapts.”_. Even in this early phase, FPA practices having backups: members are encouraged to keep a hardcopy of their emergency plan and to try a phone-free communication drill using radio. This ensures the **user journey won’t break if technology does** – a core tenet of FPA’s resilience strategy.
