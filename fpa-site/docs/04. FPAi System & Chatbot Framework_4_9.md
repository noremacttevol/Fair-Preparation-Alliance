- **Ethical Guidelines and Safety:** The FPA has strong ethical boundaries that FPAi is _explicitly_ required to uphold. FPA is about **defense and resilience, never aggression** ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=q56,ethical%20boundaries/)). So, FPAi will **not** assist with or encourage anything illegal, violent, or against our principles. For example, if someone tried to ask “How can I build a dangerous device?” the AI would refuse, because FPA **prohibits advocating violence or malicious acts** ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=q56,ethical%20boundaries/)). The alliance’s stance is clear: we prepare to protect our families and communities, not to provoke harm. FPAi’s training includes these red lines. It also remains politically neutral – you won’t see the AI opining on political matters or conspiracy theories. Its focus is practical preparedness, full stop. All content goes through an ethics filter: no extremist content, no discrimination, and no medical or legal advice beyond standard first aid and guidelines (for anything serious or medical, it will always recommend seeking professional help). These constraints are reinforced by the oversight team, who review how the AI handles edge questions (like inquiries about weapons or civil unrest) to ensure it responds within policy. Additionally, **privacy is respected**: FPAi only asks for data that helps with preparedness and keeps it
