- We have backup power (generators, solar panels, deep-cycle batteries) for these radio stations. A solar-charged radio tent can keep running for days ([Amateur radio emergency communications - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_emergency_communications#:~:text=ImageSolar,HF%20transceiver%20for%20voice%20communications)). In fact, some squads practice setting up field radio stations with portable antennas in hours; this is our communications “quick reaction force.”  
- We coordinate with official emergency services frequencies where possible. Even if we’re an independent org, we follow radio etiquette and try to complement the efforts of, say, the Red Cross or local authorities on the air. We can act as a liaison: for example, if a local government Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has a HAM station, our operators can exchange info with them, effectively plugging FPA intel into official channels and vice versa. Our decentralization can fill holes in their command chain.
