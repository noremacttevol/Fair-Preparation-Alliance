- **Training Programs & Curriculum:** This team designs and delivers the **training curriculum** for FPA members at all levels. Starting with the basics (Prepper Boot Camp for new recruits covering water purification, basic first aid, firemaking, etc.), up to advanced courses (like Small Unit Tactics, Advanced Trauma Medicine, Radio Operator Certification, etc.). They collaborate with subject matter experts (often senior members or external experts who share our ethos) to create courses. The curriculum is standardized to ensure an FPA member in Oregon has the same core skills as one in Florida. But it’s also adaptive: if a region faces certain threats (say wildfires in the West, hurricanes in the Southeast), the training for those scenarios is emphasized there. Readiness doesn’t believe in _“online only”_ learning – while materials may be in the app, every key skill must be _practiced_ physically. They schedule regular hands-on workshops and field days. Even something like cybersecurity has a real-world drill (e.g., practicing secure comms in the field, or what to do if a device is compromised). The motto is **“Train as we fight, fight as we train”** – meaning realism is baked into all training.
