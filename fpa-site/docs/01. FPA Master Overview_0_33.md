Outernet Integration & Hardware: Tech & App Dev manages our interface with the Outernet (a.k.a. Othernet) satellite broadcast system. They decide what data we should beam out via satellite daily, and they set up the equipment and encoding to do it. This might involve curating a daily data package (like an encrypted bulletin or updated maps/PDFs of new training content) that gets broadcast from a satellite. They also ensure every region has at least one Outernet receiver (ideally more) to collect incoming data. This team often designs custom hardware kits – for example, a cheap DIY Outernet receiver that members can assemble (a small satellite antenna plus a software-defined radio dongle and instructions). If it’s tech that can help the Alliance, this team figures out how to build it or integrate it.
