**Building for Resilience, Not Control:** One stark difference between what we’re doing and typical organizations is we are intentionally building something that **does not depend on any one of us or even the organization itself**. We’re not constructing an empire with top-down control; we’re essentially giving away the “keys” to everyone who joins. This requires humility and trust in our fellow citizens. It’s more like laying down a common law than enforcing an ordinance. For early contributors used to traditional hierarchies, this can feel counterintuitive – but remember, our goal is not to reign over a big follower count, it’s to empower others to eventually not need us. We succeed when communities can run their own preparedness using the principles we spread, without requiring constant supervision. In a way, we’re coding ourselves out of the job, and that’s noble. It’s like designing an organism that can survive on its own in the wild. So if you ever feel the itch to hoard information or centralize because it feels safer or more controlled, recall our mission and let go. Steward the mission, _not_ an empire.
