- Camp Bedding: If feasible, cots or hammocks (with mosquito netting in buggy climates) are used in base camps for comfort. Hammocks double as improvised chairs and keep one off wet ground, but need trees or stands.  
- Heating/Cooling: In cold: portable tent stoves (for those with sturdy tents) or at least safe heat sources and ample blankets. In heat: battery fans, shade tarps, and knowledge of ventilation setups.
With this gear, members can establish a dry, warm (or cool) and safe sleeping environment almost anywhere. FPA emphasizes the importance of quality sleep even in crises, so having reliable shelter and bedding is not luxury but necessity to keep everyone functional and healthy.
