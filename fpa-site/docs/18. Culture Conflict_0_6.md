These guiding principles inform all the detailed processes that follow. Members should keep these values in mind at every step: identify issues in good faith, communicate with honesty and respect, insist on fairness, and never shy away from accountability. By doing so, conflict becomes not a threat but a forge for our culture – tempering it into something even stronger.  
II. Organizational Structure for Conflict Resolution and Resilience  
FPA’s internal structure is designed to support effective conflict resolution. Our alliance is organized into collaborative units called squads and circles, with an overall movement-wide assembly. This nested structure provides multiple layers at which a conflict can be addressed. In general, issues should be resolved at the lowest possible level (between individuals or within a squad) before escalating upward. Higher levels serve as backstops for tougher conflicts and ensure consistency across the Alliance.
