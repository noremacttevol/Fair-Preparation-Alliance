Anti-Abuse Measures = Trust in the System: Nothing drives fragmentation faster than people losing faith in the system’s fairness. If members believe the conflict system is rigged or useless, they will either drop out or form rival power structures. Our anti-abuse protections (Section VI) are therefore critical to unity. Because we enforce no retaliation, impartiality, and leadership accountability, members trust that they can seek justice within FPA. If a leader or group were acting corruptly, members see that the system is designed to catch and correct that, so they need not take matters into their own hands splintering away. In short, members trust FPA to handle FPA’s problems. This trust in the system is arguably the strongest glue to keep us together.
