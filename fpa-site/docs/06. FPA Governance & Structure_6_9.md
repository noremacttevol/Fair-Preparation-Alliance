- **Offline-First Communication & Fallback Systems:** One harsh lesson from past disasters (from hurricanes knocking out power to internet blackouts in conflicts) is that reliance on always-online systems can cripple coordination when the grid fails. FPA is building everything with an **“offline-first” mentality** as part of an overarching [[Offline-First Resilience System]]. In terms of tech, this means our apps and databases are designed to work with no internet – syncing data when possible, but functioning peer-to-peer or locally when needed. For communications, we rely on ham radios, CB radio, mesh networks, and face-to-face meetup protocols as much as we do on Slack or email. We have an **Offline-First System playbook** that outlines how every circle should prepare to operate in a communications blackout: pre-set check-in times, analog methods (like physical bulletin boards at designated safe houses), and caches of printed critical info (for example, hard copies of the Compass Guide and local maps). Each member is encouraged to have a basic radio and know how to use it; each local circle maintains an “offline cache” – a rugged hard drive or even a binder of paper files with key contacts, plans, and intel that’s updated regularly. When things are normal, it’s routine (even boring) to keep these up to date; but when things go sideways, they’re lifesavers. We also integrate **rank enforcement into offline scenarios**: for instance, if a regional coordinator can’t reach
