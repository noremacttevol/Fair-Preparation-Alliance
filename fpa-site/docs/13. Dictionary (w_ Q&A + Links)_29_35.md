Q36: Do I need a firearm to be a prepper?
A: It depends on your comfort level, local laws, and willingness to train. Many preppers do own firearms for self-defense. In a severe crisis (especially a breakdown of law and order), you might be on your own for protection, and a gun can be a powerful tool to defend against dangerous people when police or security aren't available. However, owning a firearm comes with serious responsibility and risk. Without proper training and discipline, a gun could cause more harm than good. You need to be skilled in safety and marksmanship, and store it securely (especially if children are around). You also must follow all local laws regarding ownership and use. In short: a firearm can enhance your security in worst-case scenarios, but itâ€™s not an absolute requirement for being a prepper. If you do choose to have one, commit to learning how to use and maintain it safely. [#Beginner] [#Security]
