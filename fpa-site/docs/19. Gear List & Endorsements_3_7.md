6. **Ongoing Monitoring & Badge Withdrawal:** Endorsement is not a one-and-done deal. Once a gear is endorsed, the Alliance continues to monitor its performance and the vendor’s behavior over time. Members regularly report their real-life usage experiences in their Gear Audit Journals, and any critical feedback is logged. If a pattern of problems emerges – or if the vendor changes the product for the worse, raises the price unfairly, or if new information comes to light – the FPA can **trigger a re-evaluation**. In serious cases (safety issues, fraud, etc.), an emergency vote is called to **withdraw the endorsement badge**. _For example, suppose the PowerMaxX charger (if it were endorsed) later had a manufacturing change that caused many units to fail in the field. Members would report these failures, and the Alliance might issue a notice: “Endorsement of PowerMaxX suspended pending investigation.”_ The gear would then either be fixed and re-validated, or removed from the Approved List entirely. We would update all platforms and notify members (and publicly, if it was a public endorsement) that the item is no longer endorsed and why. **Rationale:** This phase protects our credibility and keeps vendors accountable. It tells members that we’ve got their back _after_ they buy the gear, not just before. If something goes wrong, we address it. It also deters companies from complacency – they know that if they cut corners later, they’ll lose the FPA badge and the community’s
