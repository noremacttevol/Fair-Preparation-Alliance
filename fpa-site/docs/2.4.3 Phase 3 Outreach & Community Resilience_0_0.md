Phase 3 is the stage in which FPA moves beyond internal survival and begins to actively contribute to the broader community’s recovery and long-term resilience. Typically initiated once the immediate chaos subsides or if a new post-crisis reality sets in, Phase 3’s hallmark is the launch of the [[Outernet (Phase 3 Media Layer)]]. The Outernet is envisioned as an FPA-driven information and entertainment network that can reach survivors far and wide, providing critical news, educational content (e.g., how to purify water, basic medical procedures, farming techniques), and even cultural content (stories, music, podcasts) to maintain morale and share hope. By leveraging the underlying Realnet infrastructure and possibly radio broadcasts, FPA in Phase 3 becomes a beacon of knowledge in a world where conventional media may be down or propagandized. In parallel with Outernet’s external outreach, Phase 3 involves FPA members stepping into leadership or support roles in local rebuilding efforts. The Alliance may encourage members to openly coordinate with other groups of survivors, local community leaders, and any remaining authorities to help rebuild essential services. Because FPA prepared extensively in Phases 1 and 2, its members likely have surplus know-how and some resources that can benefit their neighbors. For instance, an FPA medical specialist might help establish a community clinic; members with engineering or trade skills may assist in repairing critical infrastructure
