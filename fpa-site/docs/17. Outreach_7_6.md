- **Printed Matter On Demand:** Each FPA squad has the capability to produce physical copies of information during a crisis. This could be as simple as battery-powered printers or even **pre-printed emergency flyers** kept in storage. For example, if internet is out, a squad member can use a template (prepared in advance) to write up the day’s situation report or instructions (like boil-water notice, shelter locations, etc.), make copies using a portable copier, and then post these in key locations (relief centers, community bulletin boards, church doors, etc.) or hand-deliver to households. We prioritize a _print-first protocol_ – meaning for any digital message, there’s a procedure to get it onto paper swiftly.
