Finally, a note to all members: This plan is ambitious – roughly 15,000 words of frank instructions – because the stakes are high. Natural disasters, grid failures, and societal crises don’t wait for us to get ready. FPA’s community is growing because we acknowledge a hard truth: **help is not guaranteed** in the first critical days of an emergency. We must help ourselves and each other. By following this phased plan, starting with your own household and scaling up to a nationwide alliance, you are taking ownership of that reality. The tone may be blunt at times, but it’s rooted in respect – we believe every member, regardless of income or background, can contribute meaningfully. **Practical preparedness is the great equalizer.** Whether you’re a tech-savvy urban dweller or a single parent in a rural town, this roadmap provides a clear path for you to build resilience without breaking the bank. Let’s get to work.
