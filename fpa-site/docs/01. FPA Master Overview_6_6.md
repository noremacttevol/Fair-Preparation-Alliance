- **Validating AP:** It’s not a blind honor system – points are usually **validated by peers or superiors**. The app has workflows: e.g., after a training, the instructor submits the roster for AP, or after a mission, the mission lead assigns points to participants which are then reviewed by regional command. We also have a Q&A / knowledge base that quizzes members on learned material for some auto-points. Cheating the AP system is difficult (and dishonorable) – if caught, penalties are severe, including loss of rank or expulsion for repeated fraud. Fortunately, the kind of person who joins FPA isn’t usually the type looking to game a system for a shiny badge – they want to _earn it_.  
- **AP Thresholds for Rank:** Each rank has a minimum AP requirement. For instance, maybe E-2 requires 50 AP, E-3 requires 150 AP, E-4 requires 300 AP, etc. These specifics come from the **FPA Dictionary & SOP guidelines**. As you go higher, it might be exponential; e.g., E-9 might require 5000 AP, which represents years of heavy involvement. However, _meeting the AP threshold alone doesn’t automatically grant promotion_ – especially for higher ranks. Key promotions (like to NCO ranks or senior positions) have boards or leadership approval steps. AP gets you in the zone for consideration. It’s a way to **flag who’s put in the work**.
