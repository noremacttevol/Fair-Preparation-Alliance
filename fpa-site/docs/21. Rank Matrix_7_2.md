- **Accountability:** With greater rank (especially for officers) comes greater accountability. Officers have term limits or regular re-validation (through elections or reviews). If an officer fails to perform or violates trust, they can be removed by the same mechanism they were appointed. Prestige members proposing projects must deliver results to maintain their status. In essence, the structure prevents anyone from resting on their rank – one must continue contributing to retain the community’s respect.  
These principles ensure the FPA remains an **alliance of equals working toward a common goal**, with the rank structure serving as a motivator and organizer, not a divider. The ultimate aim is that every member, at whatever rank or role, feels empowered to contribute and improve, and sees the path to do so clearly.
