a safe house (so the host knows it’s friend not foe). They also train on living low-profile if you’re in someone else’s area – contributing labor, not drawing attention. Some FPA documents may list criteria for a good hideout: water source, defensibility, off main routes, etc. The approach is very much like an underground railroad or resistance network ethos: safe havens prepared quietly for those in dire need. Not everyone will end up using one, but having them mapped out adds resilience. This also ties into their strategic caches and pre-positioned supplies. So FPA’s stance: incorporate a “scatter plan” – if a group must disperse or go dark, they have rendezvous at safe houses where they can regroup and sustain until it’s safe to come out or move on.
