system within this (like tagging notes with #first_aid or #phase2) which provides another layer of organization across categories. Implementing Zettelkasten in a tool like Obsidian ensures that even offline (with the vault stored on a laptop or tablet), the full linking functionality works. The disciplined use of this method keeps the knowledge base from becoming a messy dump; instead, it’s a cohesive network of ideas where each note is bite-sized and dedicated to one topic, but also connected to many others. Over time, as the number of notes grows, this web only becomes more valuable, essentially modeling the collective brain of FPA – the connections representing experience and insight accrued. In practice, members find it intuitive and empowering: they know that if they have a question, the answer is likely a few clicks away through well-labeled, well-linked notes in their living library.
