Current State – Niche but Timely: Prepping has long been niche, often associated with “doomsday preppers” stereotypes. However, recent events (the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing climate disasters, geopolitical instabilities) have mainstreamed the conversation around self-sufficiency and resilience. There is evidence of broader interest: for instance, segments of the political left – traditionally less associated with prepping – have started embracing “sustainable prepping” due to climate change and distrust in government aid under past administrations. This indicates a potential for growth beyond the usual demographic. FPA is viable in principle because the need for community-level preparedness is real and arguably growing. The early adopters will likely come from existing prepper communities, disaster relief volunteers, and forward-thinking local leaders.
