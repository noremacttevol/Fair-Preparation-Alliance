Impartial Facilitation: All formal mediators, liaisons, and panel members are expected to adhere to neutrality. They receive training on recognizing their own biases and avoiding favoritism. If a mediator realizes they cannot be impartial (maybe they are close friends with one party), they must recuse themselves and arrange an alternative mediator. We keep a diverse pool of trained facilitators so that there’s always someone suitably impartial available. In particularly thorny or high-stakes conflicts, we might bring in an external mediator or arbitrator who has no prior ties to anyone – this is especially useful in conflicts involving senior leadership, to ensure even the perception of bias is minimized.  
Evidence and Documentation: To prevent manipulation, we rely on clear documentation at each step. If someone makes a claim, we encourage them to provide specifics (times, what was said/done, witnesses if any). Mediators keep notes of meetings (which can be reviewed by higher panels if needed). This written trail makes it harder for anyone to twist the narrative later. It also helps detect if someone is abusing the system by repeatedly filing baseless complaints – the pattern would be evident. Conversely, if someone repeatedly faces complaints, that pattern is also visible, indicating a likely issue with that individual. In essence, documentation introduces accountability into the conflict process itself.
