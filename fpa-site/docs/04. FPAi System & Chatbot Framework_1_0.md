FPAi is built to support you across all aspects of preparedness. Key capabilities include:  
- **Instant Q&A and Guidance:** You can ask FPAi any preparedness question – from survival skills to FPA protocols – and get a clear, no-nonsense answer. It pulls facts from vetted FPA resources (like the dictionary or _SHTF Bible_) to give you accurate info **without sugarcoating or fearmongering**. It’s like chatting with an experienced instructor who “tells it like it is” and then helps you fix any issues. For example, ask _“How do I purify water?”_ or _“What does E-5 mean in FPA ranks?”_ and FPAi will answer with concise guidance pulled from official sources ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=,in%20the%20_compass%20guide_%20for/)). It can also explain procedures (e.g. how to shut off a gas line during an earthquake) by quoting the relevant Standard Operating Procedure snippet ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=questions%20on%20procedures:%20allie,%20how,-ul26c1c/)). In short, FPAi serves as your on-call knowledge base.
