conflicts are actually defused by proactive measures: clear [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] upfront, consistent leadership behavior, and promoting friendship and understanding through regular [[Member Meetings and Events]]. Thus, formal discipline is infrequent. When everyone buys into FPA’s mission and values, conflicts are resolved with the shared goal in mind: keeping the Alliance strong and united. (See also: [[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]] – rebuilding trust after conflict, and [[Member Retention and Burnout]] – sometimes conflicts stem from stress, so support is given.)
