AI triage gates the application via effort signal.  
If approved, user enters squad onboarding track.  
All onboarding is offline-mirrrored (PDF bundles, radio drills).  
Squads must be able to accept, train, and log rank progress entirely without online infrastructure (HAM + [[SHTF Bible and Skills Training System]]).  
II. Rank & Role Enforcement  
The point system is detailed in [[FPA Rank Structure]]. All authority and access routes through earned status:  
E-1 through E-9: Earned via drills, submissions, gear, squad votes.  
E-10: Honorary or merit-based for long-standing expertise.  
O-1 to O-10: Officer track for planners, logistics, and national/regional command roles.  
Roles such as "SignalNode," "WaveRider," or "Trainer" are applied at E-7 to E-9. These are [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]-defined.  
III. Strategic SOP Alignment  
Every decision in FPA must pass three SOP filters:  
1. Is it executable offline by a squad of 6 with no internet?  
2. Is it trackable, audit-able, and reversible if abused?  
3. Does it scale horizontally (by adding squads) instead of vertically (by adding bureaucracy)?  
For example, see enforcement logic in the [[FPA SOP MK1MOD3 Rewrite]].  
IV. Technology Backbone (Offline First)  
Described in full in [[FPA’s Offline-First Resilience System]] and [[CORE AI DEMANDS YOU’VE BUILT INTO FPA]]:  
FPA App is optional, not required.
