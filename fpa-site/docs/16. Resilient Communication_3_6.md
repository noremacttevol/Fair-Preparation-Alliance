**FPA’s Stance:** Every squad, every member, should treat HAM radio capability as a core pillar of their operational readiness. It is **Alliance policy** that at least one operator per squad (if not every individual) obtain an amateur radio license (Technician class or higher, depending on jurisdiction) or equivalent training, and maintain the equipment to use it. In practical terms, this means each team needs a reliable radio (HT or mobile unit) that can operate on commonly used amateur frequencies for your region, and at least one member who regularly practices on-air skills. The Alliance will assist by offering HAM licensing classes and radio training as part of our ORP program (see Training section below). We also maintain a frequency plan – a list of designated primary and backup frequencies on various bands – to be used by FPA members in emergencies (this is detailed in the **Offline-First Resilience System** documentation and should be loaded into every member’s radio memories). HAM radio is our primary long-distance communication method when the grid is down, but it’s not the only tool (we also use FRS/GMRS, CB, etc., for local comms). However, HAM offers a level of range and versatility that the others don’t, making it the strategic linchpin for inter-squad and inter-community coordination.
