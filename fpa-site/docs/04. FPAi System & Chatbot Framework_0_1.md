--># FPAi System & Chatbot Framework  
**FPAi** is the Fair Preparation Alliance’s integrated artificial intelligence assistant – essentially a chatbot and smart system that helps members with everything from answering questions to evaluating emergency plans ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=,in%20the%20_compass%20guide_%20for/)). Available through the FPA app and website, FPAi acts like a 24/7 virtual mentor, drawing on FPA’s knowledge base (the FPA Dictionary, _SHTF Bible_, etc.) to provide accurate, practical guidance ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=,in%20the%20_compass%20guide_%20for/)). It’s designed to be **reliable even in crises** – working hand-in-hand with offline tools (like radios, PDFs, and printed guides) so that members aren’t left stranded if the internet goes down ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=philosophical%20questions,work\)%20tool/)). This guide explains what FPAi is, how it works, and why you can trust it, whether you’re a new member or a seasoned veteran.
