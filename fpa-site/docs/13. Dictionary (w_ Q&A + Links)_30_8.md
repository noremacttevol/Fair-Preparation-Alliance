Q6: What is the Operational Readiness Progression (ORP)?
A: Operational Readiness Progression (ORP) in FPA terms is likely a structured program or framework that outlines how members advance in their preparedness capabilities. Think of it as a roadmap of skill and preparedness milestones. For example, ORP might have tiers or levels – starting with basic readiness (like having a 72-hour kit and basic first aid training), then intermediate readiness (maybe 2 weeks of supplies, advanced training, team drills), and then advanced readiness (like leadership roles, specialized skills such as ham radio or trauma medicine, etc.). The idea is that members progress through these stages as they gain experience and training, ensuring that the alliance as a whole is raising its readiness level over time. ORP could also tie into how FPA organizes teams or deploys resources: members at higher ORP levels might be tasked with more responsibility during an operation or crisis response. In short, the ORP is a guideline to systematically improve and measure how “ready” a member or unit is, so FPA can gauge its overall preparedness and ensure continuous improvement.
