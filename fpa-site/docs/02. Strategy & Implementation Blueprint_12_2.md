- **Accountability:** With authority comes accountability. Leaders at this level are subject to review by peers and the Tribunal. Their squad’s performance and their adherence to FPA principles is visible. If issues arise (e.g., a leader consistently ignores SOPs or mistreats members), the Tribunal can intervene and, if needed, revoke leadership status. This is rare, but it underscores that leadership in FPA is by **earned trust, not entitlement**.

To summarize the progression, the following table outlines the four phases:
