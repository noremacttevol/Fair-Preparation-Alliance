**Dynamic Resource Management:** Another operational enhancement is how we manage supplies and logistics via dynamic pricing and inventories (see Chapter 10). The new logic in our system monitors supply levels of critical items and can suggest re-distribution or bulk ordering across squads. For instance, if Squad A has extra water filters and Squad B has extra batteries, the system (and the Trust Doctrine encouraging sharing) will facilitate a swap so both squads are better balanced. Under Mk1Mod2, such inter-squad resource leveling was informal and often didn’t happen in time. Mk1Mod3’s approach, aided by transparent pricing and an alliance-wide inventory view, makes resource management far more efficient. It’s a bit like how some cities now use dynamic systems to balance electricity load – we’re doing it for prepper supplies and skills.  
In summary, the operational toolkit of FPA has been thoroughly upgraded. We have clearer structures, better communication backups, smarter use of technology, and more efficient logistics. These enhancements all serve the same goal: **to ensure that when a crisis comes, our response is faster, safer, and more unified** than was possible under Mk1Mod2.
