Trust Liaisons: A Trust Liaison is a designated person (or small team) within each circle whose special role is to maintain trust and facilitate conflict resolution. Trust Liaisons are typically peers who are respected and trained in mediation. Their duties include: being an approachable point of contact for any member in the circle to confidentially discuss concerns; mediating conflicts that individuals or squads cannot resolve alone; advising squad leads on handling delicate situations; and ensuring that the conflict handling process is followed fairly. For example, if two squad members tried to work out an issue but reached a stalemate, they might request their circleâ€™s Trust Liaison to step in as a neutral mediator. The Trust Liaison would then arrange a mediation meeting, establish ground rules (like respectful listening and equal time to speak), and guide the conversation to help the parties find common ground. Trust Liaisons do not have authority to impose decisions; their influence comes from trust and skilled facilitation. In cases of severe conflict or misconduct, a Trust Liaison can escalate the issue to the Circle Council or a higher level, but they will also stay involved to ensure continuity and support for those impacted.
