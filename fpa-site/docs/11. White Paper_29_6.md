> _“I’ve been in disaster relief for 20 years, but I’ve never seen anything like this network. During the last hurricane, I used our FPA app to vote on where to send our extra generators – and the next day, I heard on the radio that exactly that plan was in motion. It feels like being part of a living organism that actually listens.”_ – FPA Regional Coordinator, Southeast US
