When a new person joins FPA, they start by achieving Level 1, which may take a few weeks or a couple of months depending on their starting point. FPA provides a checklist of tasks and trainings for each level. For instance, a recruit might get a “Level 1 Checklist” that includes:  
- Attend an FPA orientation workshop (in-person or virtual).  
- Pack a 72-hour go-bag following the approved gear list (Chapter 10 covers gear tiers).  
- Complete the online basic knowledge quiz (covering trust doctrine, FPA structure, basic SOPs).  
- Participate in one team drill or meetup.  
Once those are done, their Squad Leader or a mentor signs off that the member is Level 1. The member might receive a patch or certificate acknowledging this – a bit of ceremony helps motivation and recognition.  
Similarly, to move to Level 2, the member undertakes the required trainings and demonstrates the skills. FPA might partner with local CERT programs or offer its own workshops. Progress is often tracked in the FPA App: members have profiles where they can log completed courses and preparedness milestones (like “14 days of water stored” verified by a Squad Leader). The app can show a “readiness level” badge, which fosters a bit of friendly gamification.
