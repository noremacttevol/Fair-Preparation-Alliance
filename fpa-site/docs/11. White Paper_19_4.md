**Contingency Plan:** If maintaining a single national registry proves too cumbersome or controversial, decentralize it – keep regional registries that are shared upwards. Essentially, each region’s coordinator holds their squad list and the national team holds the list of region coordinators. This way if one piece is compromised, the whole network isn’t exposed. To handle dropout scenarios (e.g., a squad goes dark or leadership quits), implement a rule that if a squad hasn’t checked in or updated in, say, 6 months, they get flagged; a regional lead will reach out, and if no response, list them as inactive (but keep their last info with a note rather than deleting, in case they resurge). In case of political interference (e.g., a government subpoenas the registry to find “dissidents”), FPA will have stored data offshore or encrypted with keys held by multiple members such that no single person can hand it over. As an extreme safe measure, no single document will contain everything openly – printed regional pages can be split among different holders. Above all, remind members: if trust doctrine is threatened, we will purge sensitive data and rely on ground truth networking to rebuild lists if we must. The registry is a tool, not a vulnerability.
