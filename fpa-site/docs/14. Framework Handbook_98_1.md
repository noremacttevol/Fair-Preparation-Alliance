**Proactive Partnerships:** Another strategic shift is in how FPA interfaces with external entities. Mk1Mod2 was largely inward-focused, but Mk1Mod3 strategy calls for **building bridges** with local authorities, businesses, and other preparedness groups. By establishing trust and common protocols (see the _Trust Doctrine_ in Chapter 3), FPA squads can coordinate with first responders or NGOs when needed. This collaborative stance increases our reach and effectiveness during large-scale crises.  
**Scenario Planning & Intelligence:** Mk1Mod3 invests more in anticipating scenarios. Strategically, the Alliance now uses improved threat intelligence (with the help of AI tools introduced in Chapter 9) to foresee compound crisis scenarios and plan for them. For example, instead of planning separately for a wildfire or a grid failure, we plan for the possibility of a wildfire _during_ a grid failure, and tailor our readiness plans accordingly. This shift towards **scenario-based planning** makes our strategy more adaptive and realistic given the complex risk landscape.
