**Ranks E-1 through E-5 focus on personal preparedness and basic operational skills.** New members learn to prepare themselves and get introduced to the Alliance’s communication network and knowledge base. The first five ranks and their key milestones are:  
- **E-1 (Novice):** Create a **personal emergency plan** for yourself/your family and assemble a basic emergency kit. This foundational plan covers how you’d handle common disasters, evacuation routes, contacts, etc. Completing this plan (and sharing it with a mentor for feedback) earns you the first rank, Novice. _(AP earned along the way: initial points for making the plan and starting your preparedness journey.)_  
- **E-2 (Apprentice):** Build your knowledge through formal learning. At this stage, you **pass basic preparedness quizzes** covering disaster awareness, safety procedures, and Alliance guidelines. This confirms you’ve absorbed essential preparedness concepts. _(AP: points from completing training modules and quizzes.)_  
- **E-3 (Communicator):** Acquire your first field gear with a focus on communication. Typically, you **obtain a reliable radio** (for example, an FRS/GMRS handheld or an entry-level HAM radio) and demonstrate basic operating skills with it. You learn how to power it via backup battery, how to tune to the Alliance’s channels, etc. _(AP: points for gear acquisition and a successful radio check with a mentor.)_
