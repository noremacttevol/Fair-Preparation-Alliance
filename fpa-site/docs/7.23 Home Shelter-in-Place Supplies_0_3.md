- Containers: Durable jugs, collapsible water bags, and canteens for carrying and storing water (including a means to collect rainwater).  
- Filtration: Portable water filters (like Sawyer or Katadyn) that can remove bacteria/protozoa. Many carry a straw filter for personal use and a gravity-fed or pump filter for group use.  
- Purification: Chemical treatments (water purification tablets or plain bleach with dosing knowledge) as backup to kill pathogens. Some also use UV purifiers (battery or hand-crank powered) for quick treatment.  
- Boiling setup: A metal pot or kettle (even a single-wall steel bottle) is kept handy for boiling water over a fire or stove – the surest purification method when fuel is available.  
- Well and hand pump: At fixed locations, if there’s a well, a manual hand pump or bailer bucket is maintained to retrieve groundwater without electricity.
This combination ensures members can procure (collect) water and make it safe in any scenario, whether filtering a creek on the move or treating tap water during a boil notice.
