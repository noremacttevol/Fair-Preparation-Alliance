Resource Allocation & Logistics: While other teams specialize in certain logistics (Tech handles tech tools, Readiness handles physical gear, etc.), Core Coordination oversees allocation of resources across all content families and regions. They decide, for instance, how to distribute that $100k/month budget we discussed to meet competing needs. How much goes to bulk food stockpiles (Readiness)? How much to app development (Tech)? How much to outreach events (Comms)? They maintain a central dashboard of Alliance capabilities – who has what skills, where the gear caches are, which region needs reinforcement – and direct resources accordingly. If one region is hit by disaster, Core makes sure aid flows from elsewhere. If another region is lagging in preparedness audits, Core might surge training resources there. This big-picture allocation role keeps the Alliance balanced and strong everywhere, not just in pockets.
