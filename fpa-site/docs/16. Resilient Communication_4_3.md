- **Computing/Knowledge Module:** Here we ensure that even _offline_, our teams have brains as well as muscle. This module typically includes an **“offline AI-enabled tablet”** or rugged mini-laptop. That device contains the entire FPA knowledge base – manuals, PDFs, standard operating procedures (SOPs), field medicine guides, engineering diagrams, maps, the Trust Doctrine, Compass SOPs, and more – all available without internet. Moreover, it includes an AI assistant program (running locally, no network needed) that can help users navigate these documents. For example, a team member could type in a question like “how to sterilize water using improvised methods” and the offline AI will fetch the answer from stored documents or knowledge, guiding the user through FPA-approved methods. This is a powerful force-multiplier: even if a squad is cut off from leadership, they carry a virtual mentor with them, one that’s loaded with Alliance-approved info and logic. The computing module also often contains maps (topographic and road maps for the region), GPS device (with off-grid maps), and encrypted storage of important Alliance data (like contact lists, frequencies, etc.). For security, these devices are password-protected and data drives can be physically removed. They are kept in a Faraday sleeve when not in use, to shield from EMP or hacking. Some squads include small peripherals: a rollable e-ink display or printed waterproof field guides as backup to the digital device, and
