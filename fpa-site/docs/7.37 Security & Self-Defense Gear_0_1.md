- Edged/Impact Weapons: Some carry knives not just as tools but for last-resort defense. A few may have machetes or collapsible batons, again where legal. Even a sturdy hiking staff can serve as protection against animals.  
- Body Armor: Rare but a few have soft armor vests or rifle-rated plates, particularly if they volunteer in disaster areas with civil unrest potential. Helmets (like surplus military or construction hard hats) can protect from thrown debris or other impact threats.  
- Alarm Systems: Tripwire alarms, driveway alarms, or even a simple can-on-a-string noise maker can be part of a cache to set up around a perimeter to get early warning of intruders.
The Alliance also emphasizes that self-defense also includes situational awareness and communication – hence all the focus on radios and signaling. By having security gear and the training to use it, members add a layer of protection for themselves and their families. It’s always coupled with good judgement: avoidance of conflict is the first goal, use of force is last resort. But if law enforcement is stretched thin, FPA’s security preparations help ensure the group can protect its people and resources from harm until order is restored.
