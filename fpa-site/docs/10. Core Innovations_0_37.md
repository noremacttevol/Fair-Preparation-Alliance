**What’s already implemented (current wins):** We trained 25 **Preparedness Mentors** across chapters who have been working with members on personalized plans. So far, ~150 members have gone through the process of building their SHTF plan with an FPA mentor or the AI tool. A huge win: those plans are **logged (securely) in our system** so members can update them easily and mentors can reference them in a crisis to coordinate help. We’ve seen improved completeness – prior to this, perhaps 30% of new members had a written plan; now 80% of those engaged with the program do. The scenario drills have been eye-opening as well. For instance, during a “House Fire Evacuation at 3am” scenario run-through, one family realized their important documents were not easy to grab – they’ve since compiled a go-binder. Another member ran a “regional flood” scenario and discovered their backup evacuation vehicle (a motorcycle) wouldn’t work for the whole family – prompting carpool planning with a neighbor (another FPA member) as a solution. We also integrated scenario practice into meetups: last month, the Phoenix chapter did a group drill of a heatwave grid failure scenario that was generated to match their area; members swapped plans and gave peer feedback. This **community review element** made plans even stronger and spread ideas around. The _Personalized Plans_ initiative has clearly increased individual readiness – and by extension, collective readiness, since each prepared member is one
