FPA App Deployment (Offline-First): Early in Phase2, we roll out the FPA mobile/desktop app to all members. This isn’t a flimsy cloud-only app – it’s built offline-first for resilience. The app and its data fully function without internet, syncing opportunistically when networks are available. Members can access maps, their SOP checklists, emergency protocols, and even an offline copy of the FPA Q&A Knowledge Base and SHTF Manual on their device. Peer-to-peer sync lets squads nearby share updates via Bluetooth or local Wi-Fi if cell towers are down. The app uses end-to-end encryption for any data in transit. In short, even if the grid goes dark, our digital tools will continue to serve the Alliance. (See the [[FairProtection Alliance (FPA) App – White Paper]] for technical architecture and integration details.)
