- **Self-Reliance:** Every member works to be as capable as possible. This means taking personal responsibility for your training and gear. You don’t wait for someone else to save you – you put in the work so **you** can be part of the solution. From learning first aid to securing your home, self-reliance is about being an asset to your group, not a liability. (Importantly, self-reliance does _not_ mean isolation; it’s about strengthening the individual _so they can better contribute to the team_.)  
- **Teamwork:** We rely on and support each other because community strength is key. FPA operates in **squads** and chapters – small teams that trust each other like family. You’ll train together, share burdens, and have each other’s backs. In a crisis, one person alone can only do so much, but a well-prepared team can achieve what individuals can’t. Teamwork also means communication and respect up and down the chain – you follow leaders when needed and step up to lead when called.  
- **Continuous Improvement:** Preparedness is a journey, not a one-time checklist. FPA members are always training, learning, and adapting. There’s no “done” – when you master one skill, you move to the next. We conduct after-action reviews following drills to find weaknesses, we stay updated on new techniques, and we embrace constructive criticism. This principle keeps us humble (there’s always more to learn) and resilient (we evolve as new challenges arise).
