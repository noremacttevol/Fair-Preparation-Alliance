Drills and Scenario Planning: Chapters conduct periodic drills (e.g., a “bug-out weekend” simulation where everyone practices packing and meeting at a rally point, or a communications blackout drill using only radios for 24 hours). These exercises reveal gaps and reinforce readiness. Also, members develop personal/family emergency plans and then use the [[“Test My Plan” Program]] to have those plans reviewed and stress-tested by peers.  
OPSEC and Low Profile: Throughout Phase 1, FPA keeps a low profile publicly ([[Public Outreach and OPSEC in Communication]] guidelines ensure members don’t inadvertently expose the group). Members may be encouraged not to advertise their affiliation; any community outreach is framed in generic preparedness terms, not “here is our secret alliance”. This ensures that when things are normal, FPA doesn’t attract thieves or undue scrutiny, and members avoid becoming targets for having supplies.
