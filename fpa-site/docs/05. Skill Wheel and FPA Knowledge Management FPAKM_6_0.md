Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the Skill Wheel system is its integration with **FPAi** – the Alliance’s AI-driven preparedness analysis engine (which functions as a kind of expert advisor or chatbot for members). The Skill Wheel provides rich raw data about **who knows what, and how well**. FPAi will transform that data into actionable intelligence: namely, **Projected Survivability Scores** and **Personalized Learning Paths** for each member.
