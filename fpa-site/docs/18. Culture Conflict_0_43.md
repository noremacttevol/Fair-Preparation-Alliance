(if the parties still disagree). An example: Circle X and Circle Y have a dispute because their strategies seem to conflict and teams are duplicating work, causing frustration. A panel of three individuals from Circle Z and Circle W (unrelated) is formed. They find that the root issue is a lack of clarity in FPAâ€™s overall strategy allowing overlap. They recommend a clearer division of responsibilities and that the Movement Council adjust the strategic plan to resolve ambiguity. In the meantime, they mediate a deal between X and Y to collaborate on the overlapping project rather than compete. The presence of neutral panelists helps cool any inter-circle rivalry and ensures neither circle feels biased against.
