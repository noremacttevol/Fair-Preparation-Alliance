Practical drills are a core part of FPA’s preparedness regimen, translating plans on paper into tested action. The Alliance regularly conducts simulations of emergency scenarios to evaluate readiness and improve coordination. These drills vary in scope and complexity:  
Communication Drills: On a scheduled basis (e.g., weekly or monthly), chapters practice emergency comms. A typical drill might involve a sudden “comms blackout” scenario where members must reach each other using only radios. They practice initiating a net on the primary channel, relaying messages, and using backup methods if someone doesn’t respond (like driving to check on them). These exercises refine use of the [[Ham Radio Network]] and Realnet protocols and ensure everyone knows their call signs and code words ([[Communication Drills and Exercises]] and [[Emergency Frequencies and Channels]] tie in here).  
Bug-Out Drills: The chapter is instructed that at a certain time (perhaps unannounced for realism), they must simulate evacuating. Members grab their go-bags and travel to a designated rally point or safehouse. This tests their personal preparedness (was the go-bag complete and easy to grab? how long did it take to mobilize?) and the viability of their routes (did anyone hit unexpected obstacles or traffic?). After the drill, they discuss what items they forgot or what issues they encountered. These drills reinforce the plans made in [[Rally Points and Evacuation Plans]].
