A governance document like this is meant to be foundational and lasting, but the FPA also recognizes that we must adapt and improve through experience. This blueprint itself will be subject to **member-driven evolution** over time:  
- **Experimental Protocols and Pilot Programs:** We’ve noted throughout where certain ideas are in testing (marked as _Experimental_ or _Pilot_). We treat the alliance a bit like a living lab – we’re willing to try new approaches on a small scale, measure the results, and then decide as a group whether to adopt them widely. For instance, the _Founding Member tier_ and the _AI Oversight Structure_ are being piloted. We document the outcomes (did the founding tier help fundraising without causing rifts? did the AI tool actually improve response times without false alarms?) and share those findings with the membership. These experiments have sunset clauses or review dates. By that time, all affected members (or reps, depending on scope) will discuss and vote on whether to make it official, tweak it, or scrap it. **Nothing experimental becomes permanent without going through our consensus process.** This prevents “pilot” features from sneaking into default usage without people realizing it. It also encourages innovation – folks know they can propose crazy ideas, because we’ll test them responsibly and nobody’s going to break the alliance by trying something new in a controlled way.
