Q9: What role do simulations or wargames play in FPA training?
A: Simulations and wargames are important tools FPA uses to test and improve preparedness. By running through realistic scenarios (on paper, via computer simulation, or live drills), members can practice their responses to various emergencies. For example, FPA might organize a weekend “grid-down” simulation where members operate without electricity and communications to see how they’d manage. Or a tabletop exercise might simulate a pandemic outbreak, challenging a group to coordinate and allocate resources effectively. These exercises help identify weaknesses in plans – maybe communications take too long, or certain supplies run out faster than expected – so they can be fixed before a real crisis. They also train members to think on their feet and work as a team under stress, which builds confidence. Wargaming worst-case scenarios (even unlikely ones like a coordinated cyberattack or multi-city terrorist event) can also highlight interdependencies and the need for contingency plans. In short, simulations are like rehearsals for FPA: they make sure that when something bad happens for real, the alliance has already “been there” in practice and can respond faster and smarter.
