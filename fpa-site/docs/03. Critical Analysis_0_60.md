2. Tech Fragility: Will the App Work When It Matters?  
Real Threat Level: Extremely High  
Why it’s real: If the power dies, and the app fails with it, the whole network fractures unless the fallback drills and print manuals are second-nature.  
Where you're strong: You’ve solved this with your offline-first doctrine: the SHTF Bible, Outernet radio frequency (7.200 MHz), pulse tests, and printed SOP kits.  
Still weak?: Only if the fallback procedures are underused or forgotten. The best tech is invisible in crisis. Make the print kits and radio drills the primary system, not the backup. That’s your edge.

3. Culture War Contamination: Ideological Drift  
Real Threat Level: Medium-High  
Why it’s real: Prepping is a loaded concept. The moment FPA is seen as aligned with one ideology—left, right, militia, or commune—it risks alienating 50% of the population and media demonization.  
Where you're strong: The tone is nonpartisan, pragmatic, and focused on “community-powered realism,” not politics.  
Still weak?: Local squads may attract or skew toward a political culture, especially in rural areas. You need strong onboarding and Trust Doctrine enforcement to reject ideology creep. The term “Federally Agnostic” was smart branding for libertarian members.

4. Scaling Logistics: Volunteer Burnout + Quality Drift  
Real Threat Level: High (but surmountable)
