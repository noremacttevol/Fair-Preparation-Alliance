**Lessons Learned:** Initially, many squads relied on a single radio-savvy member – a single point of failure. One drill revealed that when that person was sick, the entire squad went silent. The takeaway: redundancy in expertise is as important as redundancy in equipment. Training multiple people per region (at least a primary and a backup) became non-negotiable. We also discovered that formal HAM licensing, while ideal, can’t be a bottleneck – we needed to train people in radio use **even before** their license arrives (with the understanding they transmit only in true emergencies until licensed)[theprepared.com](https://theprepared.com/survival-skills/guides/beginners-guide-amateur-ham-radio-preppers/#:~:text=depend%20on%20the%20electrical%20and,data%20grid)[theprepared.com](https://theprepared.com/survival-skills/guides/beginners-guide-amateur-ham-radio-preppers/#:~:text=strikes%20when%20someone%20in%20your,a%20medical%20emergency%20while%20camping).
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Launch a recruitment drive targeting amateur radio enthusiasts and communicators to volunteer with FPA (e.g., reach out to HAM clubs, tech forums, CERT graduates with comms interest).  
- Organize regional training workshops for communication leads covering HAM radio operation, basic radio repair, Outernet device setup, and message logging.
