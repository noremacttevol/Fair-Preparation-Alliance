External Input and Learning: FPA also learns from outside. We stay informed on best practices in conflict resolution, organizational psychology, and cultural competency. We might invite experts to audit our processes or conduct workshops for us. If other organizations have useful models (for example, another alliance that survived a major internal crisis), we study and possibly adopt those lessons. Being part of networks (like a consortium of ethical nonprofits or a community of practice for conflict mediators) can give us fresh perspectives. Openness to external critique is also part of transparency – down the line, we may even publish our conflict resolution outcomes publicly as a sign of accountability and to invite trust from stakeholders outside the Alliance. Knowing the world’s eyes could be on how we handle our affairs motivates us to keep them exemplary.
