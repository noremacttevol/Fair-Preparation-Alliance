We should take full advantage of these – it’s a huge boost especially for those who can’t afford expensive private courses. Additionally, our early FPA workshops revealed that people are squeamish or anxious about medical tasks. The frank lesson: **Get over it now.** It’s better to be uncomfortable in a class than frozen in fear when someone’s bleeding in front of you. Post-drill surveys also taught us the value of cross-training: not just one “medic” in the family or squad, but everyone knowing the basics, because the medic could be the one hurt. We carry that forward: no bystanders in training – everyone participates.
