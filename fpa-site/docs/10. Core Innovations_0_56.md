**Why it was created (problem it solves):** Trust is the glue of any alliance, especially one preparing for scenarios where we may rely on each other for survival. Initially, trust was built informally at the local level, but as FPA grew online and across regions, we faced a challenge: **how to foster trust among members who haven’t met** and **how to quantify and encourage trustworthy behavior**. This innovation solves the problem of **scaling trust**. The Trust Graph allows trust to be “visible” and trackable beyond immediate personal relationships, helping members decide whom to collaborate or share resources with. It deters bad actors because reputation logic makes it hard to escape poor behavior – if someone is not reliable, it reflects in their profile. Conversely, it **rewards positive contributions**; people who help others a lot see their reputation rise, which in turn opens up more opportunities (like leadership roles or access to sensitive tasks). In essence, this system formalizes _accountability and credibility_ in a growing community. _Reputation is a rough measure of how much the community trusts you ([What is reputation?
