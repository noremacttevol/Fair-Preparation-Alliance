Now, the _fair_ part of Fair Preparation Alliance: **dynamic pricing**. Unlike the outside market where scarcity often drives prices up (harming those who can least afford it), FPA uses a controlled pricing model to keep things equitable. Here’s how it works:  
- **Sliding Scale for Members:** When you join FPA, you have the option to indicate your general income level or financial situation (this is confidential, and it’s okay to skip – we use trust and honor for this system). Based on that, members fall into broad contribution tiers:  
- _Supporter Tier_ (higher income) – you pay roughly retail price or slightly above for gear/training.  
- _Standard Tier_ (middle income) – you pay a moderate, subsidized price.  
- _Assisted Tier_ (lower income or financial hardship) – you pay a heavily discounted price (sometimes just covering cost or even free if fully subsidized).  
The idea is similar to community sliding-scale models. Everyone gets the same gear or training, but contributes according to their means. In practice, the app or our logistics team simply assigns a price or point cost to you that fits your tier. It’s low-key – other members don’t see who’s in which tier, and we treat everyone equally in all other respects. The goal is that all members, regardless of income, can attain a decent level of preparedness. No one should be safe just because they’re wealthy, and conversely, being less wealthy shouldn’t mean being left vulnerable in disaster.
