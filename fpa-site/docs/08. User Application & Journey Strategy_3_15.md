In summary, Phase2 upgrades the user journey to be **smart, efficient, and scalable**. The **application process** becomes faster (most legit users approved instantly) yet still **selective** (weeds out misaligned applicants via AI & admin oversight). **Onboarding** becomes richer and tailored, accommodating different personas – whether a “Susan” joining to protect her family or an avid outdoorsman looking to share skills, each gets a relevant starting path. **AI** plays a helper role: not just in screening, but as a personal guide (the FPAi assistant) that ensures each user navigates the 7-step journey successfully ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=%20file%200:%20introduction%20to,mission,%20vision,%20values,%20community%20focus-dg956j/)). Meanwhile, the system continues to bake in FPA’s values – through transparency, community input, and keeping humans in the loop for trust-critical decisions. By the end of Phase2, FPA should be capable of growing to tens of thousands of members without losing its identity or reliability.
