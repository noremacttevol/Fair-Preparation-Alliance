**Empowering Autonomous Action:** Interpreters need the freedom to make decisions. FPA leadership (top contributors, national coordinators, etc.) must consciously **decentralize decision-making** and not micromanage. We provide guidelines and boundaries, but within those, local squads and their interpreters have latitude. For example, our guidance might say “Ensure everyone in an affected area gets the critical alert within 30 minutes.” _How_ a local interpreter achieves that could vary – one might use a fire truck’s PA system, another might assemble a volunteer runner team. We won’t prescribe every detail, because that flexibility encourages creative solutions using available resources. After action, we debrief to see what worked, and those innovations might inform future formal guidance. By trusting our interpreters to act, we reinforce their confidence and skill. And should one approach fail, another might succeed – that’s the resilience of decentralization.
