The Operational Readiness Doctrine does not stand alone – it’s woven into the FPA’s broader ecosystem of guides and systems. Key linkages include:  
- **[[Compass Guide]]** – The FPA’s ethical and decision-making framework. It defines what actions are acceptable and prioritized at each readiness phase (especially important when squads must make independent calls under pressure). _It provides the moral and tactical “compass” during operations._  
- **_[[SHTF Bible]]_** – A compendium of scenario plans and survival knowledge. It offers print-ready pages and checklists per region, which squads use during drills and emergencies (e.g. wildfire-specific guidance for West Coast squads). This ensures regional context is factored into readiness.  
- **[[Trust Doctrine]]** – Our alliance’s trust and governance framework. It ensures that any **fallback leaders** or autonomous squad actions under System Override are backed by a history of trust and vetting. (For example, the doctrine might specify that the person stepping up as backup lead has a certain trust rank or endorsements on record.) It connects readiness with our accountability systems.
