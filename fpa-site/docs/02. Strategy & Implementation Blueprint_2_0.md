**Mission Statement:** The FPA’s mission is to **empower communities with a resilient support network** that thrives both in daily life and during crises. We combine human teamwork, robust offline-first technology, and principled governance to ensure that when systems fail or the unexpected strikes, our members remain prepared, connected, and in control of their own outcomes.  
**Strategic Objectives:** To fulfill this mission, we focus on several core objectives that direct all our planning and actions:  
- **Resilience First:** Build an _offline-first_ resilience system that keeps critical tools and information accessible without reliance on external infrastructure. No single point of failure – communications, data, and coordination must continue even if power, internet, or other services go down.  
- **Empowered Squads:** Organize members into small, autonomous **squads** that train together, support each other, and act as the fundamental units of operation. Squads enable rapid local response and create tight trust bonds within a large network.  
- **Trusted Technology:** Develop and deploy the **FPA App** and AI assistants as reliable partners – tools that augment human decision-making while being transparent, controllable, and safe. All technology is aligned with our Trust Doctrine, meaning it operates under strict oversight and can be audited by members.
