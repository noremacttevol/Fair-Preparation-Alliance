A: Yes, many in FPA consider financial collapse a plausible crisis, and they prepare by focusing on economic resilience. This includes tangible assets: members are encouraged to keep some savings in cash (for short-term emergencies when banks are shut or ATMs empty) and possibly in precious metals like silver or gold for longer-term value storage (though after essentials are secured, as earlier noted). They also stress reducing debt and learning to live frugally – skills like DIY repairs, growing food, and bartering become very handy if money’s tight or currency is unstable. FPA might host workshops on alternative economies: how to barter effectively, form local trading co-ops, or start a time bank (trading services by the hour). They will have discussions on recognizing early signs of collapse (so members can withdraw money, stock up and secure assets before banks freeze). During a slow financial decline, FPA communities can support each other by sharing surplus and helping with job networks or communal buying of supplies to save cost. In a sudden collapse, the preparedness in food, water, etc., doubles as an economic buffer (you don’t need to buy overpriced goods if you already have your stash). Additionally, FPA encourages diversifying skills – someone who loses their job could pivot to a useful trade in the preparedness community (like carpentry, canning, etc.). Psychologically, they prepare for civil unrest that might come with economic turmoil, thus security measures
