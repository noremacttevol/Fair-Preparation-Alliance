6. **Communication Setup:** The app walks the user through setting up communications: joining the FPA online chat (if separate app or platform), and crucially, scheduling their first **HAM radio check**. The onboarding may include an interactive tutorial for radio use, ending with the user confirming “I successfully contacted the regional frequency or responded to a call” (this ties into progression later). FPA’s [[Offline Resilience]] plan is introduced here practically – the user tests their off-grid comms _during onboarding_, not as an afterthought.  
7. **First Engagements:** The new member is prompted to participate in their first **community engagement**. This could be signing up for an upcoming local drill event, posting a self-introduction in the squad chat, or taking the “Compass Quiz” (a short quiz on FPA values, ensuring they read the Compass Guide highlights). Early engagement is tracked. The system might award a badge or “Level 1” achievement after completing all the onboarding steps, reinforcing progress.
