Step 2: Cross-Circle Mediation Panel – If a conflict spans multiple circles (e.g., between members or leaders of two different circles) or if one circle’s internal attempts failed, we convene a Cross-Circle Mediation Panel. This panel is a neutral taskforce drawn from uninvolved parts of the Alliance. It might include, for instance, a couple of Trust Liaisons or council members from other circles, or respected senior members who are not directly connected to the dispute. The Movement Council or Culture Committee can help appoint this panel to ensure credibility. The panel’s mandate is to investigate the conflict impartially, hear all sides, and facilitate a resolution or make a recommendation. Because this is cross-circle, the panel has to balance possibly competing interests from different parts of FPA. A structured approach is used: first the panel meets each party separately to gather perspectives, then it brings parties together for mediated talks if appropriate, then it deliberates on findings. They might utilize conflict resolution techniques like Restorative Circles for group conflicts, giving each side a chance to speak while others listen. The panel will produce either an agreed solution (if mediation succeeds) or a report with recommendations to the Movement Council (if the parties still disagree). An example: Circle X and Circle Y have a dispute because their strategies seem to conflict and teams are duplicating work, causing frustration. A panel of three
