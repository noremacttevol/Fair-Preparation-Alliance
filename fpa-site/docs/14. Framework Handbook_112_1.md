This system, refined in Mk1Mod3, contrasts sharply with the free market chaos seen in many disasters. By deciding in calm times how to handle resources in chaotic times, FPA avoids a lot of conflict and inequality. It’s **preparedness with fairness built-in**.  
**Cultural Impact:** Dynamic pricing and gear tiers reflect FPA’s commitment to “leave no one behind.” It helps build trust – members know they won’t be exploited or forgotten. Supporter-tier folks often say the system gives them a meaningful way to contribute beyond just prepping for their own family; Assisted-tier folks feel dignified being able to prepare adequately, not just left vulnerable. And everyone benefits because a well-prepared neighbor is one less person in crisis during the disaster (and likely one more person helping others).  
**Legacy Note:** In Mk1Mod2, we had informal gear swaps and maybe a small group discount program, but nothing as robust as this. Some older terms like “gear exchange” or “prepper store” have been replaced by our **Dynamic Logistics system** and **FPA Marketplace**. The ethos of fairness was always spoken about, but now it’s operationalized.
