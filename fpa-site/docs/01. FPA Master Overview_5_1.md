- **20k Member Threshold – Cap Activated:** Once the Alliance hits **20,000 active members**, we cap our total monthly membership revenue at **$100,000 per month**. This is the **membership dues cap** – a hard ceiling on how much money we’ll take in from membership fees in a month. Why $100k? Through extensive planning (and living lean in Phase1), we determined $100k/month is enough to fund a fully operational FPA (covering tech infrastructure, logistics, emergency funds, etc.) at a pretty large scale. Beyond that, taking more money per month would risk excess that isn’t immediately needed – which can breed waste or temptation for misuse. So at 20k members, that’s $5 each (20,000 * $5 = $100k). Now, **as membership grows past 20k, the individual dues actually decrease** to maintain that $100k total.  
- For example, at 40k members, to stay at $100k/month, each member’s dues would effectively be $2.50. At 100k members, it’d be $1 each. This happens automatically via our system – members might see their monthly charge drop proportionally as we cross thresholds. We view this as a **dividend of growth** – the more people join, the less each person pays, but overall funding stays sufficient. It’s the opposite of most organizations that get more money-hungry as they grow. FPA’s model ensures we **never collect more than we truly need**.
