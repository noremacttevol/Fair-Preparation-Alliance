training with expanding scope**. That’s why we built the phase progression and tie-ins to rank: as members advance, we expect a broader set of experiences. Also, elite communities instill the mindset that _you’re never truly done_. Martial arts masters often say “a black belt means you’re a serious student, not that you’ve learned everything.” We mirror that ethos: reaching an elite level in FPA (say a very high Skill Wheel and rank) is framed as the start of a new level of responsibility (teaching others, refining subtler skills), not an endpoint.
