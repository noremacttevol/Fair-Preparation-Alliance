Past drills revealed that about half of new members with radios hadn’t even figured out how to tune to local emergency frequencies – a potentially fatal oversight. Lesson: we must train and test. Another lesson from volunteer responders is to coordinate with officials _ahead of time_.

FPA’s approach is to produce operators who are **competent and credentialed** – no loose cannons with radios. We also emphasize **EMP-proofing** your comms (see Phase1.5) so your gear survives solar flares or worse.
