A. Squads, Circles, and the Alliance  
Squads: The smallest working unit in FPA is the squad – typically a small team (e.g., 5-10 members) focused on a specific project or goal. Squads are semi-autonomous and highly collaborative. They operate with trust and informality, so conflicts at this level are often personal or task-related disagreements among team members who know each other well. Every squad is expected to handle most of its own issues internally through direct conversation and in-circle remediation (resolving problems within the team itself). The squad culture should be one of openness where each member feels empowered to say, “We need to talk about this,” when friction arises. For example, if two squad members clash over how to execute a task, they are encouraged to discuss the disagreement between themselves or with the squad as a group rather than immediately involving higher-ups.
