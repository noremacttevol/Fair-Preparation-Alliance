|**Scout/Recon** (optional)|Gathers external information. In some squads, especially in rural or expansive areas, one person might take on the scout role. The Scout’s job is to venture out (when safe) to survey conditions – checking a nearby river’s flood level, observing damage in town, or keeping an eye on approaching weather fronts. They report back so the squad has good situational awareness. Scouts often have good navigation skills and stay physically fit for potentially strenuous tasks.|
|**General Members**|The remaining squad members who don’t have a single designated specialty. Every member is expected to have a baseline of proficiency in key skills (communications, first aid, basic self-defense, etc.), even if they aren’t the lead. General members assist the leads: they take turns on radio duty, help carry out security patrols, share in cooking and shelter setup, etc. They are essentially the versatile backbone of the squad, ready to learn and do what’s needed.|  
_(Note: In smaller squads, roles are combined – e.g., one person might handle both Communications and Logistics tasks. The important thing is not having one area completely neglected. Squads should periodically review their makeup and train members to cover multiple roles when possible.)_
