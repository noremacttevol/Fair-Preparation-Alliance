- **Integrated Communications Web:** In Phase3, every communication channel and device is part of a unified web. The FPA app, member radios, satellite feeds, local mesh networks, and even third-party platforms seamlessly hand off information. The concept of the **“Outernet”** becomes two-way where possible: not only do we receive broadcasts, but if one member with a satellite uplink is active, important local data can be uplinked and then broadcast down to others. Imagine a fully distributed network: if internet is up, great – use it; if not, the system auto-routes via radio relays or sat-com. **7.200MHz pulse frequency** remains our symbolic heartbeat – even if high-tech nets are running, many of us still tune in daily to 7.200LSB to hear the human voices of our network. It keeps us grounded and provides a backstop if all else fails. In Phase3, losing one mode of comms is an inconvenience, not a show-stopper. The Alliance could be jammed, censored, or cut off in one medium and we’d still flow like water through another.
