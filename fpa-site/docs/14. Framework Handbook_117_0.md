Seven days on, the power is partially restored, and outside aid has fully mobilized. The acute crisis is ending, recovery is ramping up:  
- **Assessment of Impact:** The FPA chapter holds a debrief meeting (some in person, some calling in). They go over what went well and what didn’t. It’s noted that the “mesh network never went down – huge success,” and that “dynamic pricing system ensured even our poorest members had all necessary supplies pre-storm,” which likely saved lives. Points of improvement might come up: e.g., communications with a neighboring chapter could be better, or certain SOP steps were skipped in confusion. All that feedback is documented to feed into Mk1Mod4 updates.  
- **Community Perception:** The local news runs a piece on how community groups like FPA were crucial. They interview a resident who says “Our neighborhood team (FPA) checked on us and even had extra medicine for my father when the pharmacy was closed. I’ve never seen people come together like this.” This kind of recognition helps FPA grow and also sets an example for other communities.
