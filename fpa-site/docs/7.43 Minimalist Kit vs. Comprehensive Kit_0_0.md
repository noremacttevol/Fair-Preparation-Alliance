FPA recognizes that preparedness is a spectrum; sometimes one can only carry minimal gear, other times one has the luxury of a fully loaded kit. They educate members on scaling their gear to circumstances:  
- Minimalist Kit: This might be what you grab if you had to run right now with only what’s on your body (an elevated form of EDC). It focuses on the core survival priorities: a way to make fire, a container for water, a knife, a bit of cordage, and perhaps a poncho or emergency blanket for shelter. The alliance occasionally challenges members to survive a night out with just their minimalist items to reinforce skills trump gear. A classic minimalist kit is a small belt pouch or tin containing fire starter, water purification tablets, fishing line/hooks, a tiny flashlight, and multitool – enough to improvise. These also serve as backup: if you lose your main pack, the mini kit on your person can keep you alive.
