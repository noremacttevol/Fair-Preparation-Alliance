- Integrate registry info with communication tools: e.g., have call signs and frequencies for each squad handy, so if a region relay needs to hail Squad X, they know what channel or contact to use as per the registry.  
- Ensure proper security: the master registry might contain personal contact info, so store it encrypted if digital, and mark printed copies “FPA internal use only.” Implement a need-to-know access policy – perhaps region leads get full details for squads in their region, while general members might just see a high-level version (like a map of squads) to encourage networking without exposing phone numbers.
