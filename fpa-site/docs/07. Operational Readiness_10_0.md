Beyond general drills, every key **role** in the alliance has specific scenario responsibilities. We require periodic simulation of these duties so that individuals can perform their role under stress. Typical role-play scenarios include:  
|**Role**|**Must Simulate (Scenario)**|
|---|---|
|**Family Anchor** (household lead)|Use a printed SOP packet to coordinate a small group (e.g. family members), delegating tasks like water storage or first aid to untrained helpers.|
|**Scout** (mobile recon)|Operate with a TierII kit in the field – navigate to a checkpoint, gather intel, and report back via radio (testing endurance and comms under pressure).|
|**Hub Lead** (squad command)|Run scheduled comm pulse checks, manage incoming reports, and assign fallback duties to squad members when normal comms/leadership are disrupted.|  
These role simulations are typically carried out quarterly. **Drills are not optional** – they are built into our rank advancement criteria. If a member in one of these roles fails to participate in their simulation drills, it will halt their progression and trigger a review. Missed or poorly executed simulations require that the person re-train and be re-evaluated by their squad before their leadership role or rank is fully upheld. This way, titles and trust have to be continuously earned through practice.
