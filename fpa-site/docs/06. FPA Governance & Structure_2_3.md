**Decision Rights & Escalation:** To keep this distributed system coherent, we clearly define what decisions can be made at each level and when something should be escalated. A small **squad** or local circle can make immediate tactical decisions on the ground (e.g. how to respond to a neighborhood emergency) without asking permission. However, issues that affect multiple circles or allocate significant resources are escalated to the appropriate council. Each circle knows its **decision rights “lane”**: if a decision’s impact goes beyond that lane, it’s brought up to the higher coordination group. For example, a squad dealing with a localized incident will handle it internally, but if they need additional resources or if the situation risks spilling into other regions, the squad leader notifies their Regional Circle lead or council. That Regional Circle, if it cannot resolve internally, passes the issue to the National Council. We have formal escalation channels to ensure nothing falls through the cracks: a squad lead → circle council → national council, as needed. Councils operate with defined **quorum rules** – e.g. a council must have a minimum number of representatives participating to make a binding decision, ensuring decisions aren’t made by an unrepresentative few. We strive for consensus in councils, but we have fallback voting mechanisms (like supermajority votes) if consensus can’t be reached in a timely manner.
