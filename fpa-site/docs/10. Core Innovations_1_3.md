- **Inter-Alliance Partnerships:** FPA is looking to partner with adjacent organizations (CERT teams, ham radio clubs, mutual aid groups) to amplify efforts. _Need Feedback:_ If you’re part of another community or know groups we should ally with, let us know. What partnerships do you think would benefit our mission (e.g., joint drills with CERT, information exchange with Red Cross)?  
Each open track is an **opportunity for members to co-create FPA’s future**. We will post detailed proposals on the member forum and schedule open Zoom discussions for each. Your voice matters – FPA has always been by members, for members. By engaging with these upcoming projects, you continue the cycle of innovation.
