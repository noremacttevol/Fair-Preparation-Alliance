A: FPA takes a practical approach to defense training, focusing on skills and teamwork rather than hierarchy. Members are encouraged to train in self-defense (unarmed and with personal weapons they choose to carry), often in peer-led workshops or by leveraging members who have military/law enforcement backgrounds as instructors. They might organize shooting practice, tactical drills, or home defense seminars. Without ranks, everyone is a student and potentially a teacher: those with expertise share knowledge freely. In group defense scenarios, roles are assigned based on skill, not rank – one member might naturally direct others during a defensive drill because they understand tactics better, and the rest listen because they trust that expertise. FPA likely emphasizes coordination signals, perimeter security routines, and rules of engagement aligned with legal self-defense, all agreed upon by the team. They may simulate intruder scenarios in training where each person knows what to do (who grabs the go-bags, who covers what entry, etc.) through practiced plans rather than a commander barking orders. Communication and clear plans substitute for formal rank structure. In essence, everyone is trained to be a responsible defender of themselves and their group, stepping into leadership or support roles dynamically as needed. This approach aims to ensure if a situation turns dangerous, any member can take initiative and others will coordinate because they’ve drilled it together,
