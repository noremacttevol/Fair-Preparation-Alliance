**Validation Process:** In addition to AP and task completion, rank promotions require validation – a check that the member indeed met the requirements and is ready for the next level of trust. The validation level becomes more rigorous at higher ranks. Lower ranks might be automatically granted by the system or a mentor once tasks are done (basic validation), while higher ranks require peer review or even a vote. The FPA uses several levels of validation: an **automatic check (no human approval needed)**, **mentor or senior member approval**, **peer/squad vote**, **Board review/approval** (by a committee or leadership board), and finally **full membership vote** for the most important transitions. Each rank has an assigned “validation type” and a corresponding numeric index (0 for auto, 1 for mentor sign-off, 2 for peer vote, 3 for board sign-off, 4 for full member vote). As you progress, the validation moves from an individual mentor’s approval up to the collective approval of the whole Alliance for the highest positions. This ensures **trust and transparency** – when someone reaches a high rank, many others have had a say in confirming that achievement.  
In summary, **to advance a rank you need**: (1) to complete all required tasks for that rank, (2) to accumulate at least the minimum AP required, and (3) to pass the specified validation process. The following sections describe the ranks in detail and how members progress through them.
