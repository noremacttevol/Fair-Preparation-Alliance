- **Mentorship and Collaborative Learning:** As alluded to, we want high-skill members to gain status by _lifting others up_, not just by showing off their own skills. We may formalize this by incorporating mentorship into our advancement criteria. For example, to reach the highest rank in FPA, part of the requirement could be “mentored at least 2 other members through to intermediate proficiency.” This way, those with near-complete wheels channel their energy into teaching, which benefits the whole community and also keeps the focus on collective readiness. It shifts the bragging rights dynamic into something healthier: your brag is not “I have 90% in everything,” but rather “our squad increased its average by 15% this year, partly thanks to my coaching.” That’s a boast that actually aligns with our values.
