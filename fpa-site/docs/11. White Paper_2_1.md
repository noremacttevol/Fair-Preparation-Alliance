Each milestone in Phase1 is concrete and measurable – no vague “be better prepared” statements. We’re talking numbers and deadlines, like a target count of members completing a training by a certain date. This creates accountability. We include real examples (e.g., a ham radio saving a family during a hurricane) to drive home _why_ each milestone matters. And since many individuals tend to overestimate their preparedness (FEMA’s 2023 survey found over half of Americans feel prepared, yet only 12% have ever practiced plans with neighbors ([Are Americans Prepared for Disasters? FEMA’s Survey Reveals Key Findings - Risk and Resilience Hub](https://www.riskandresiliencehub.com/are-americans-prepared-for-disasters-femas-survey-reveals-key-findings/#:~:text=three%20or%20more%20actions%20to,disaster%20within%20the%20last%20year))), we’ll share lessons learned from actual disasters that expose common blind spots. **Action Steps** at this phase are mostly things you can do with little or no money: knowledge, training, networking, and low-cost gear hacks. By design, these steps are accessible to someone on a tight budget or with limited time. Finally, we end Phase1 with a **Contingency Plan** section addressing what to do if personal preparedness efforts hit obstacles – for example, if you can’t afford a piece of gear or if FPA’s app is temporarily down, we have a workaround. In short, Phase1 builds resilient individuals who form the bedrock of the Alliance. Here are the key
