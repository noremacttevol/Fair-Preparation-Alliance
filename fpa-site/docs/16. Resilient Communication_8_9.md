In training, we simulate loss of command. For instance, partway through an exercise, the instructors (HQ) will stop responding, forcing squads to self-organize a leadership conference via radio. Those who step up to coordinate are evaluated on how well they include others and stick to alliance values. The end result we want is that even without formal command, leaders emerge and cooperation continues â€“ essentially a **graceful degradation** of command-and-control, rather than a collapse.
