Anticipated Challenges: One risk in large-scale reflection is that it can turn into a gripe session without resolution, or that only the loudest voices get heard. We mitigate this by using skilled facilitation, structured agendas, and ensuring diversity of input (everyone gets to contribute through surveys or small groups, not just outspoken individuals). Another risk is defensiveness from leadership – if critiques target those in power, they might be tempted to downplay issues. We counter this by our leadership making a commitment to humility and learning; in fact, we might have an external moderator precisely to hold leadership accountable to listening. We remind everyone that critique is aimed at improvement, not blame. By modeling an open attitude at the top, we set the tone for a productive culture. Finally, there’s the challenge of follow-through: to avoid “all talk, no action,” the Movement Council will publicize what steps have been taken on each major point between forums, keeping the momentum. This consistent follow-through builds trust that our reflective processes are worth engaging in, thus members will continue to engage and the positive cycle continues.
