In some cases, categories may also confer **levels or badges** when certain milestones are reached. For example, the First Aid segment might display a small icon at 50% indicating “Certified First Responder,” or an icon at 80% for “EMT-Level Training.” These act as **micro-credentials** within the segment. However, to avoid encouraging a “collect badges” mentality over actual readiness, these indicators are kept subtle. They might appear only on a detailed view of the profile rather than on the main wheel graphic. The focus remains on the filled segment as a holistic measure of progress in that domain, rather than on a collection of individual badges.
