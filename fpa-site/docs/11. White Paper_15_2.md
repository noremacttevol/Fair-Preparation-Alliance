- Offer budget-friendly tiers: ensure an expansion plan that can scale down if needed. For example, Plan A (full funding) gets every squad a receiver; Plan B (half funding) gets one per region and shared use. This way partial funding still yields progress.  
- Engage the FPA community in fundraising: perhaps a voluntary dues system or a special campaign where members can donate or help raise awareness. Emphasize print options too (like mail-in donations or local fundraising events) to not exclude those offline.  
- Ensure any raised funds are tracked and reported on. Set up an audit sub-committee (maybe from Phase 3â€™s transparency efforts) to oversee that every dollar goes to Outernet rollout as intended.  
- Negotiate with the Outernet service provider for bulk or nonprofit rates. For example, if we commit to many receivers, can we get discounted bandwidth? Explore in-kind donations like a satellite firm providing free signal for disaster months.
