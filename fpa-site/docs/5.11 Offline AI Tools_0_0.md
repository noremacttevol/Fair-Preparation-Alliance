Recognizing that internet-based AI might not be accessible in a grid-down scenario, FPA is interested in offline AI capabilities. This means having AI models and software that can run locally on laptops or devices without needing a cloud server. For example, the alliance might use an offline language model (a smaller version of something like GPT) stored on a rugged laptop as a sort of smart encyclopedia or advisor that doesn’t require connectivity. This can be pre-loaded with a ton of survival texts or the entire FPA vault, so members can query it in natural language (“How do I splint a broken arm?”) and get an answer drawn from the stored data. Another instance is offline OCR and translation – members could scan a printed foreign language document with a camera and an AI on their device could translate it on the spot, all without internet. There are also AI models for image recognition that could be loaded to identify plants (useful for foraging) or to analyze drone images for mapping, all offline. FPA likely invests in a few high-capacity storage devices holding these models and the necessary computational hardware (like a powerful but portable PC or even some specialized AI devices) as part of their tech kit. They practice deploying these in drills where they simulate internet loss but still need AI assistance. Preparing offline AI also means updating it periodically with new knowledge during normal times so it stays relevant. By having these tools available, the Alliance
