Phase 2 of the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) roadmap focuses on **Local Squad Formation** – building self-sufficient, community-based teams ready to respond when disaster strikes. In Phase 1, we established the FPA’s mission, resources (like the FPA Dictionary and Compass Guide), and initial member training. Now Phase 2 channels those foundations into action on the ground. Each local “squad” is a decentralized unit of neighbors and volunteers equipped with basic skills, communications tools, and a mandate for aggressive realism: assume help **won’t** arrive soon and prepare to fend for yourselves and your community. This phase’s scope covers recruiting squad members, organizing them, drilling key skills, integrating with official agencies where possible, and scaling up the network of squads. The ultimate goal is blunt but clear – **every vulnerable community should have a functional response squad** before disaster hits. Phase2 bridges the groundwork of Phase1 into tangible local readiness, and it sets the stage for Phase3’s broader network coordination and long-term resilience measures.
