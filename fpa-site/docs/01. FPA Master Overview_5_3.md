- **Transparency and Trust:** Every dollar collected through this model is tracked on our **live audit feed** (introduced in Phase2). Members can see in real-time how the funds are allocated: server costs this month, aid sent to flood victims, purchase of bulk food supplies for regional caches, etc. There’s no mystery. Moreover, because of the cap, if a surge of new members signs up, members will literally watch their own dues get reduced in the next billing cycle. It’s almost unheard of – an organization charging you **less** as it grows – but that’s our promise. We only exist to make communities readier and safer, not to line pockets.
