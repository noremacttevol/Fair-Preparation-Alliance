internet works, but FPA emphasizes having all the info offline too. However, in normal times it greatly eases coordination across the alliance’s widespread community, especially for younger or more tech-savvy members. It can also serve as a recruitment funnel – a limited version could be public, providing basic tips and an easy way for interested people to contact FPA or find a local chapter. Overall, the app is a versatile tool: day-to-day it keeps members engaged, informed, and organized; in a crisis (if networks hold up) it becomes a command-and-control platform at your fingertips; but if the net goes down, FPA is still okay because of redundant plans. The app is basically FPA’s digital Swiss Army knife, streamlining the knowledge and community aspects of the alliance. [#Intermediate] [#Technology]
