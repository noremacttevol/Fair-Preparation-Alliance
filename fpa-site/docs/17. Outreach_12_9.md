So, let’s continue to coordinate as we have, share freely, and push this strategy into action. When the next crisis comes, and we know it will, our republic of preparedness will stand. Neighbors will help neighbors with confidence, misinformation will be met swiftly with truth, and countless lives will be better off because a handful of dedicated individuals (you!) decided to write the playbook and train the players ahead of time. That is our version of forming a “more perfect union” – a union of ready and responsible communities.  
Let’s make it happen.
