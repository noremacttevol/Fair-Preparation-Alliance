Preparing for scenarios where the internet is unavailable, FPA curates extensive offline knowledge repositories. One major project in this vein is using tools like Kiwix (an offline content reader) to download whole swathes of the internet’s wisdom onto local storage. They maintain offline copies of Wikipedia, WikiHow, medical wikis (like WikEM for emergency medicine), and other relevant databases. In fact, Kiwix offers a “preppers package” that bundles survival resources – including WikiHow, iFixit manuals, Wikipedia, and more – FPA ensures they have that in a portable drive or Pi hotspot. These repositories allow members to access a vast library via a laptop or even a smartphone connected to a local Wi-Fi hotspot, without needing any external net. Additionally, the alliance collects e-books and PDFs on every imaginable subject useful in a crisis: from farming, blacksmithing, midwifery, to engineering and philosophy (mental resilience counts too). These are organized in an easy-to-browse folder structure or database. They also maintain maps offline – topographic maps, city maps, nautical charts – using apps like OsmAnd or printed atlases, because geographic knowledge is crucial. FPA’s approach is that if there’s a crucial website or video tutorial they encounter in normal times, they’ll consider saving an offline copy of it, anticipating it might not be reachable later. In chapter meetups, they sometimes have “Digital Download parties” where everyone brings hard drives and
