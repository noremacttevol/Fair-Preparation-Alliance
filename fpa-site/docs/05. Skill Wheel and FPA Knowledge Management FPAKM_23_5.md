- _No Vanity or False Incentives:_ The doctrine likely warns against creating systems that encourage checking boxes for the sake of appearances. We took that to heart – everything in the Skill Wheel must correspond to real capability. Our verification steps, the emphasis on drills and real demos, and the lack of trivial points all serve to avoid a hollow “point collection” dynamic. We will also actively audit and listen: if members find a way to game the system (e.g., someone figures out they can keep taking an easy quiz to inflate their score), we’ll adjust the system to close that loophole. The doctrine values **authenticity**, and so do we: a shiny Skill Wheel means nothing if the person can’t perform when it counts, so we’ve built in checks to always correlate the two.  
- _Teamwork Over Individual Glory:_ Trust in a team grows when everyone feels useful and no one is showboating at others’ expense. The Skill Wheel supports this by ensuring every member has at least a basic level in all areas (no one is utterly unskilled in any critical domain) and by highlighting that different people have different strengths. It’s implicitly saying: “We need each other to cover all the bases.” We’ve also avoided things like individual public leaderboards which could erode trust and camaraderie. Instead, any competitive aspect is team-based and supportive. This design was absolutely influenced by the Trust Doctrine’s guidance that we succeed or fail together.
