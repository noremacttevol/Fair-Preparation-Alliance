Key components of post-event outreach:  
- **Recovery Information Clearinghouse:** In the aftermath, information needs evolve. Instead of evacuation orders, people need to know where to get aid, how to safely return home, how to deal with new hazards (debris, contaminated water, etc.), and how to access services (FEMA, insurance, etc.). FPA squads transform their communication hubs to serve these needs. We update our bulletin boards and radio broadcasts with things like: locations of relief centers or soup kitchens, schedules for when power might be restored, tips from our **SHTF Bible** for living in austere conditions (e.g., “Here’s how to construct a basic pit latrine to stay sanitary while sewage is down”). We also disseminate **recovery micro-guides** – perhaps new pamphlets focusing on recovery tasks (like a guide on “Cleaning up safely after a flood” or “Emotional first aid: coping with trauma” which might have been a section in our materials that we now emphasize). Our tone in recovery is hopeful and practical: we acknowledge losses and hardship (show empathy) but consistently reinforce “_we can rebuild this, and we’ll do it together._”
