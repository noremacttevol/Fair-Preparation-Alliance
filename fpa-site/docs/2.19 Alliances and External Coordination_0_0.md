FPA is not an island; it recognizes the value of coordinating with other groups and organizations when interests align. Alliances in this context refer to established relationships or understandings with external entities – which could be other prepper networks, community organizations, or even local authorities – for mutual benefit in crises. Neighboring Prepper Groups: If there are other preparedness groups or MAGs (Mutual Assistance Groups) in the region, FPA may cultivate discreet alliances with them well before any crisis. This might involve a meetup between group leaders to discuss general plans or simply an introduction via ham radio. They might agree on things like an emergency frequency to contact each other, or an accord that if one group is overwhelmed, the other will try to help (resources permitting). These relationships are sensitive – OPSEC is maintained – but having a line of communication can prevent conflicts (like competing for the same resource unknowingly) and foster aid. For example, two groups might plan to divide responsibilities: one group sets up a community kitchen in a disaster, another provides security for that area. Community Organizations: FPA may quietly coordinate with local community emergency response teams (CERT), volunteer fire departments, or ham radio clubs. Often FPA members themselves are part of these organizations. Through those connections, FPA stays informed about official community response efforts and can integrate accordingly.
