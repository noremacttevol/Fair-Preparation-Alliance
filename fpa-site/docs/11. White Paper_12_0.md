**Description:** Develop and implement a unified FPA Communication Plan that designates standard radio frequencies and channels for all regions and squads. This includes primary and secondary HAM frequencies for inter-region traffic, local tactical channels for squads, and agreed-upon CB/FRS/GMRS channels as backups. By standardizing now, every member will know “where” to transmit or listen during multi-region operations, minimizing crossed signals and wasted time finding an open channel.
**Real-World Example:** In an early 2025 tornado outbreak drill spanning three states, lack of frequency coordination led to two FPA squads unintentionally jamming each other – both were using the same HAM channel to reach the relay. After adopting a national frequency plan (with unique regional channels), a follow-up exercise saw seamless communication hand-offs without overlap.
**Lessons Learned:** Without explicit frequency discipline, chaos ensues. One lesson came when overlapping radio nets in a 2024 exercise caused confusion and missed messages – a direct result of squads picking random channels. We learned that pre-assigned frequencies (with backups) and a simple band plan eliminate most of that chaos. Another takeaway was to include _all_ radio types in the plan: some groups were on CB or FRS; we had to account for those to truly cover “when all else fails.”
