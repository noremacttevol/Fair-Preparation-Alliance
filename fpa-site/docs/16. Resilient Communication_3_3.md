Why is HAM radio so indispensable in disasters? The answer is baked into its decentralized, flexible nature. Unlike cell phones or internet, ham radios **do not rely on any centralized network or infrastructure** ([katrina_hamradio](https://mst.rice.edu/PHYS501/SPR2007Papers/Nkung_kat.pdf#:~:text=With%20ham%20radio%2C%20all%20communications,This%20point%20is%20not%20accidental)). Each HAM station is an independent communication node – if it has power and an antenna, it can transmit and receive over great distances with zero external support. “Each one is a complete transmission and reception center unto itself… It works when other stuff is broken,” explained one Katrina responder ([Ham radio volunteers help re-establish communications after Katrina – Computerworld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/1690832/ham-radio-volunteers-help-re-establish-communications-after-katrina.html#:~:text=Ham%20radio%20equipment%20can%20be,%E2%80%9D)). Indeed, give a skilled operator a radio, a battery, and a piece of wire and they’ll find a way to get a message through ([Ham radio volunteers help re-establish communications after Katrina – Computerworld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/1690832/ham-radio-volunteers-help-re-establish-communications-after-katrina.html#:~:text=Ham%20radio%20equipment%20can%20be,%E2%80%9D)). All ham rigs operate on radio spectrum that is free to use (with a license) and spans short-range VHF/UHF to long-range HF frequencies capable of reaching other
