The Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) Phased Development Plan (Mk1Mod3) is a strategic roadmap outlining **three critical phases** of growth for our grassroots emergency preparedness network. It serves as a **“living document,”** meant to be updated as we learn from real events and member feedback. This roadmap doesn’t replace the _FPA Dictionary_ or _Compass Guide_ – instead, it complements them by translating FPA’s principles into an actionable timeline. (For definitions of FPA-specific terms, see the FPA Dictionary rather than duplicating those explanations here.) The focus is on blunt, **practical action steps** rather than abstract theory. Members will find clear goals, measurable milestones, and no-nonsense guidance in an “honest coach” tone – expect direct instructions and realistic assessments, not motivational fluff.
