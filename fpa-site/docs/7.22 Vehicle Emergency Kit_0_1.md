- Food and water: a gallon of water (which can double for radiator or washing use, but primarily drinking) and some durable snacks (protein bars, nuts). Also maybe a small stove or metal cup to heat water if stranded overnight (plus those emergency ration bars that withstand car heat).  
- Lighting and power: a flashlight (preferably hand-crank or with spare batteries), and if possible, a car escape tool that includes a seatbelt cutter and window breaker (kept within reach of driver). Also a phone charger (car adapter).  
- First Aid and hygiene: a car-sized first aid kit (often more supplies than a BOB version, including splint, burn gel, etc.), sanitation bags or a portable toilet solution for long waits, paper towels or rags, and heavy-duty gloves.  
- Fuel and fluids: if safe/legal, maybe a jerry can of fuel (or at least an empty one to fetch fuel) and a siphon pump. In cold climates, a small can of de-icer or starting fluid.
