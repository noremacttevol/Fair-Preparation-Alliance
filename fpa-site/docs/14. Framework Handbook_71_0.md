All FPA members have access to the SOP Compass Guide:  
- It’s available in the FPA App for quick reference. The app even has interactive checklists for each SOP, so during an incident a squad member can literally tick off steps as they’re done (this was inspired by checklist use in aviation and medicine to prevent omissions).  
- Each squad is encouraged to print hard copies of critical SOPs, laminate them, and keep them in go-bags or emergency binders – because devices could fail or batteries die exactly when you need them.  
- Key SOPs are summarized on wallet-sized reference cards (for example, a card that lists the COMPASS steps on one side and emergency radio frequencies on the other). This was a suggestion from members who wanted something even if they were away from their phone or binder.  
The Guide is comprehensive but not overwhelming. It categorizes SOPs by scenario type and severity. So, if there’s a small fire, you follow the “Fire – Minor/Contained” SOP; if it’s a large blaze affecting multiple homes, you escalate to “Fire – Major/Spreading” SOP, which has additional steps like coordinating with firefighters and initiating wider evacuation protocols.
