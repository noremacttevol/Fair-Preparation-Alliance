Preventing Fragmentation: All these checks are aimed at ensuring that even if individuals in leadership falter, the system corrects itself rather than breaks. Many movements fragment when leaders become corrupt or when a clique grabs power and others splinter off in protest. FPA mitigates that by distributing accountability (so no clique can fully shield itself) and by ensuring grievances can be heard and resolved within the movement, so dissidents donâ€™t feel their only option is to leave and form a new group. Our framework encourages internal reform over exit.
