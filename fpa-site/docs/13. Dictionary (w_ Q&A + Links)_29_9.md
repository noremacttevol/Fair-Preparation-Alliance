Q8: What does it mean to “bug out” vs “bug in”?
A: “Bugging out” means leaving your home and evacuating to a safer location; “bugging in” means staying where you are (sheltering in place). The choice depends on the situation. If your current location becomes unsafe or untenable, you bug out. For example, if a wildfire is approaching, a chemical spill occurs nearby, or law and order breaks down in your area, you’d grab your gear and get out. Conversely, if the danger is outside but your home is still a safe haven (say there’s a severe storm, pandemic, or civil unrest in the streets), you’d lock down and bug in. Bugging out requires a destination and travel plan, while bugging in requires sufficient supplies and security to ride out the crisis at home. [#Beginner] [#Preparedness]
