20k Member Threshold – Revenue Cap: Once the Alliance hits 20,000 active members, we implement a cap so that total membership revenue never exceeds $100,000 per month. This $100k/month cap is a hard ceiling on what we’ll take in via dues. Why $100k? Through planning and lean operations in Phase1, we determined $100k/month is enough to fund a fully operational FPA at scale (infrastructure, logistics, emergency reserves, etc.). Beyond that, taking more would lead to excess funds that could breed waste or misuse. So at 20k members paying $5 each, we reach $100k. As membership grows beyond 20k, individual dues decrease to maintain that $100k total. For example, at 40k members, each pays about $2.50 (40k * $2.50 = $100k). At 100k members, it would be $1 each. This adjustment happens automatically via our system – as more people join, each person’s monthly due is proportionally reduced. We think of it as a “growth dividend” for members: the more people in the Alliance, the less each person pays, while overall funding stays sufficient.
