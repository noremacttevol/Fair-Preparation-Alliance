- _Action Steps:_  
- Elect or volunteer a **Squad Coordinator** (or co-coordinators) to organize meetings and be a point of contact. Emphasize this is an administrative role, not a commander.  
- Identify other key needs: likely **Communications/Tech**, **Medical/Safety**, **Logistics/Supplies**, **Training/Drills**, and **Liaison** (for external relations). Have members volunteer for lead responsibility in one area each, according to their interests or expertise.  
- Ensure every lead has at least one backup or assistant. For example, if Jane is Comms Lead, maybe John will be secondary in case Jane’s away. Redundancy is safety.  
- Clearly document these roles and share with the team. Each lead should draft a brief description of their duties so others understand who handles what (e.g., “Logistics Lead manages our supply stash and tracks gear loans”).  
- Schedule cross-training: plan that members will periodically swap roles during practice scenarios to prevent siloing of knowledge.
