- **Coordinated Survival (Force Multipliers and Planning):** Now consider an Alliance squad: each member may only carry a modest ammunition load and basic arms for self-defense, but they are linked by radio, shared plans, and mutual trust. If trouble comes, they can call in support or retreat in a coordinated fashion. They can **allocate resources efficiently** – no one is blindly spraying ammo at a noise in the dark; instead, one scout identifies a target via radio, another member with a scoped rifle engages effectively, others hold fire to conserve ammo. They communicate to avoid friendly fire and to cover each other’s blind spots. In a supply shortage, they can reach out to other squads for barter or assistance rather than making desperate, dangerous forays. In short, their limited bullets go a _long_ way because every shot is informed and purposeful. This is **value-prepped systems** in action: tools plus training plus teamwork yield exponentially better outcomes than raw stockpiles. Coordinated groups can also tackle tasks that lone preppers can’t – like establishing perimeter security shifts, running a watch rotation on the radio for distress calls, repairing infrastructure (one finds fuel while another finds spare parts because they can communicate and divide labor).
