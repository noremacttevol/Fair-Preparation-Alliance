- **Achieving a notable feat** that brings credit to the Alliance. (For example, publishing a guidebook on disaster prep under FPA’s banner, or leading a major humanitarian relief effort as an FPA representative.)  
The process to attain a prestige title usually involves first getting the project approved (often by the Board or a committee) and then, upon completion, having the **membership vote to confer the prestige status**. This ensures the project has broad support and recognition. Validation is typically at the highest level (full member ballot or leadership council vote) because a prestige title is a unique honor – in effect, the Alliance is saying “we endorse this member’s custom contribution and allow them to carry a title reflecting it.”  
A successful candidate on the prestige track might receive a title like **“Master Instructor – Medical Response”** or **“Alliance Engineer (CWO)”** or any appropriate designation that suits the project. They might also receive a unique badge or emblem signifying their achievement. It’s important to note that prestige titles do **not grant any special authority over others or secret privileges** – they are purely honorary and functional in context of the project. A prestige member is still an E-10 in hierarchy (and would still defer to officers for chain-of-command issues), but is respected as an _acknowledged expert or creative leader_ in their domain.
