- Implement the structure in the squad registry: add rank fields for key contacts. For instance, list John Doe as O-3 Squad Leader for X Squad, Jane Smith as O-5 Regional Coordinator for Midwest, etc. This immediately shows the network who their go-to leaders are.  
- Explain and socialize the changes: hold a national radio call or Outernet announcement explaining that this isn’t a power grab but an organizing tool. Emphasize that trust and competence are how leaders are chosen; rank just clarifies roles.  
- Provide a pathway for advancement that’s merit-based: set criteria (like experience, training, peer endorsement) for someone to move from O-3 to O-4, etc., or to be awarded E-10. Possibly incorporate this into the FPA Trust Doctrine – leadership arises from service and peer trust, not self-appointment.
