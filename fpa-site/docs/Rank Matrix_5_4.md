**Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Option:** The officer track also **includes a “Chief Warrant Officer” fork** for specialized leadership at the national level without line command. This is designed for members who are technical experts and whose contributions are needed in national leadership, but who may not be in a standard command hierarchy. For example, an individual who is a communications or engineering genius might be appointed as a **CWO** to advise the Alliance on technology and lead specific programs, without having to command troops/units. In practice, a CWO in FPA would be a _national-level specialist_ – equivalent in prestige to a senior officer – who reports directly to the top leadership on their specialty. CWOs are typically appointed by the Alliance Commander and confirmed by the Board (validation level similar to other national officers). They hold an officer rank (often aligned with O-7/O-8 level in status) but their role is advisory/technical rather than commanding field teams. This allows the Alliance to benefit from top talent in strategy and innovation even if those individuals prefer not to manage large groups.
