- **Dispute Resolution:** In any group, conflicts arise – between members, or between a member and a leadership decision. Governance sets up the **dispute resolution mechanism**. Often, this is a mediation and tribunal system. If two members have a serious disagreement (say one accuses another of stealing gear, or two people claim the same role), a mediator from Governance tries to resolve it informally. If that fails, a small panel might hear both sides (sort of like a court martial style, but civilian) and then issue a binding decision. They keep this process as **swift and unbiased** as possible, so issues don’t fester. Their authority comes from the Charter, and members agree to abide by these internal “legal” processes to avoid fracturing the Alliance. It’s not heavy-handed unless it has to be (like in cases of gross misconduct). The emphasis is on fairness, giving everyone a chance to be heard, and then deciding in a way that preserves unity and mission focus.
