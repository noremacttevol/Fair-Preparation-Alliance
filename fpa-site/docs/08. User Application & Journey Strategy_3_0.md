In _Phase 2_, the FPA app evolves to handle growth and diversity of users through **AI support and automation**. The core experience is expanded and made smarter: the application process gets AI-driven efficiency, and onboarding becomes adaptive to each user. Phase2 begins once the alliance moves beyond the initial pilot group and needs to onboard users at scale (approaching thousands of members) without losing consistency or trust.  
- **Expanded Application Form & AI Vetting:** The Phase2 [[Application System]] introduces additional fields to better gauge applicant fit:  
- **“Gear Tip”** – a short (≤25 word) tip the applicant submits (e.g. “I carry a water filter in my go-bag”). This showcases practical preparedness knowledge or at least sincere effort.  
- **“Why I Want to Join”** – a brief (≤50 word) motivation statement explaining their interest in FPA, to ensure alignment with community values.  
- (Optional) **Scenario Response** – e.g. _“What would you do in a 10-minute evacuation?”_ for deeper insight.  
- (Optional) **Skills Checklist** – where they can tick any skills they have (first aid, HAM radio, etc.). This helps identify how they might contribute or which squad role fits them.
