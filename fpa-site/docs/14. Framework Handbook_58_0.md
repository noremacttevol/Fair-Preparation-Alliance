In chaotic situations, **trust saves time and lives**. If you know your team members will do what they say and look out for you, you can act decisively rather than second-guessing or duplicating efforts. Research confirms this intuitive truth: trust is “positively associated with effective community responses and resilience” across all phases of disaster management. In other words, communities that trust each other cope better and recover faster. FPA’s Trust Doctrine ensures we cultivate that trust deliberately.
