- **Dynamic Logistics & Gear Distribution:** The chapter activates dynamic pricing protocols. At the FPA cache, supplies like sandbags, plywood, and water containers are released. Those in Assisted tiers or high-risk zones get what they need at no cost (subsidized by chapter funds). Others pick up items using their points or modest payments. A spirit of cooperation prevails at the distribution point – it’s understood everyone will use these resources wisely for the community’s benefit.  
- **Information & Planning:** FPA ham radio operators tune into emergency management briefings. They relay key intel via the mesh network to all squads (e.g., expected storm surge heights, which districts might be told to evacuate). Squads use this info to fine-tune plans: some members in low areas decide to buddy up with those on higher ground. Through the app, one squad requests help to secure a community garden polytunnel – volunteers from another squad join and get it done before winds pick up.
