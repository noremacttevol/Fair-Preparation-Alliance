Q47: Should I stockpile gold or silver for a crisis?
A: Not initially – focus on essentials first. Gold and silver are mostly useful in a long-term economic crisis or for preserving wealth if paper money loses value. In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, you can’t eat gold. During short-term emergencies, people trade practical items (food, fuel, batteries, etc.) far more than precious metals. If you haven’t secured basics like food, water, medical supplies, and tools, those should be your priority before buying coins or bullion. However, once your essential preps are covered, it’s reasonable to set aside a bit of gold or silver as a financial hedge. Precious metals tend to hold value when currencies falter, which could help in a prolonged crisis or during the recovery phase. Just remember: a pantry full of supplies will serve you better in most scenarios than a safe full of silver. [#Beginner] [#Financial]
