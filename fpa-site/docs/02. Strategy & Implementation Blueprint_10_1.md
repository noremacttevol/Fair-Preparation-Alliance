- **Trust and Responsibility:** Trust is a key factor – Phase II members earn the trust of their squad. This is demonstrated by things like: showing up dependably, safeguarding equipment, handling information appropriately (respecting confidentiality and logs), and adhering to the Trust Doctrine (e.g., reporting truthfully in logs, calling out issues if they see them). A Phase II member might start to be entrusted with things like maintaining a piece of gear or leading a minor part of an operation.  
- **Operational Readiness Review:** Transition to Phase III typically requires a review. The squad leader (and possibly the Tribunal or training officer in a larger context) reviews the member’s track record. If they have participated in a requisite number of drills, completed training modules, and demonstrated good judgment, they move up. This progression is recorded in the transparency logs for accountability.  
_Phase II output:_ A dependable FPA operator – the backbone of squads – who can be counted on to follow SOPs and handle real-world scenarios as an integral team member.
