- **Internal Communications:** This aspect ensures that every member, from the newest recruit to the highest officer, knows what’s happening and what’s expected. Comms team curates and disseminates **regular internal updates**: daily situation reports, weekly newsletters, urgent alerts, and so on. In Phase2 and 3, much of this flows through the app – they’ll push notifications for drill announcements, policy changes, or intel bulletins. But they also respect that not everyone is glued to a screen; hence they maintain **multichannel comms**. Important updates might also be sent via email, SMS blasts, and posted to regional bulletin boards (digital or physical). They maintain the protocols around the **7.200MHz pulse frequency** usage too. For instance, Comms might script what is said in the nightly radio pulse: e.g., “This is FPA National with the 1900 hours pulse: All clear today, reminder of the upcoming drill this Saturday 0800, stay ready. Pulse out.” They coordinate with Tech to ensure those without tech still get messages (like printing flyers for a meet if needed).
