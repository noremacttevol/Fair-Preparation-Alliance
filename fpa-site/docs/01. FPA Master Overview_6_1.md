- _E-1 to E-3_ – These are **junior members** learning the ropes. They focus on individual skills and supporting their squad. Think of them as Private, Private First Class, Specialist equivalents in a traditional military sense (though we often just call them by their rank number to avoid confusion with actual military). They follow orders, absorb knowledge, and prove reliability. Alliance Points needed to climb in these ranks are relatively low; basic participation and completion of introductory training can get you here quickly.  
- _E-4 to E-6_ – These are the **operational core**. By E-4 (often dubbed a **Team Leader** role informally), a member likely has a year or two in FPA, solid AP under their belt, and possibly leads a fireteam or small unit within a squad. E-5 and E-6 are equivalent to **NCOs (Non-Commissioned Officers)** in effect – they might be squad leaders or hold specialized roles (like training NCO, communications NCO for a region, etc.). To get here, you’ve not only accumulated AP, but you’ve demonstrated leadership and passed certain evaluations (e.g., an E-5 might need to have led a successful drill or mentored 5 new members to E-3). The Alliance entrusts E-4 to E-6 ranks with maintaining discipline and standards at the ground level. They are the backbone that keeps squads and local operations running right.
