**Lessons Learned:** At first, content was compiled ad-hoc by whoever had time, leading to inconsistent quality and occasional duplication or gaps. A significant lesson came when two different volunteers unknowingly sent out similar messages on consecutive days – wasted bandwidth that could have delivered other info. Centralizing the process with a team eliminated that issue. We also learned the importance of vetting: one early incident involved forwarding an unverified social media rumor about a dam failing, which turned out false. After that, the Content Team instituted strict verification: at least two sources or official confirmation before broadcasting any critical alert. Additionally, scheduling regular “low urgency” content (like training materials in off-peak times) helped avoid clogging the feed when emergencies strike.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Recruit volunteers for the Content Team with backgrounds or interest in emergency management, journalism, IT, or data management. Even a couple of people per region contributing can distribute the load of 24/7 readiness.  
- Define content categories: **Emergency Alerts** (immediate threats, official orders), **Situation Reports** (summaries of ongoing incidents and responses), **Educational/Preparedness Material** (guides, training docs), and **FPA Internal Updates** (roster changes, coordination notes). This helps balance each broadcast.
