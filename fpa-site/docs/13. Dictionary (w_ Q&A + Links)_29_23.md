Q24: Why is first aid training important for preppers?
A: Because in an emergency, medical help might not be available right away – or at all. Injuries are common in disasters (cuts, burns, broken bones, etc.), and knowing first aid can literally save a life. If someone is bleeding badly or stops breathing, immediate action is critical within minutes. If you’re trained, you can stabilize the person instead of watching helplessly while waiting for an ambulance that might be delayed or never come. Even for less severe issues, first aid knowledge prevents complications (a simple wound won’t turn into a serious infection if you clean and dress it correctly). Prepping isn’t just about stockpiling supplies; it’s about being able to use skills under pressure. First aid training gives you the confidence and ability to handle medical emergencies yourself, which is a huge asset in any crisis. [#Beginner] [#Health]
