Q46: Should I learn self-defense or martial arts as part of prepping?
A: It’s not strictly required, but it’s definitely a good idea. In a crisis, police might not be around when you need them, so you could be on your own if you face danger from other people. Having some self-defense skills gives you more options to protect yourself. Taking a basic self-defense class, learning a martial art, or even practicing simple techniques can teach you how to fend off an attacker or escape dangerous situations. It’s not just about “fighting” – it also improves your situational awareness and confidence under stress. Not every prepper needs to be a black belt, but being in decent shape and knowing a few techniques to disable or deter an attacker (even just how to properly use pepper spray or improvise a weapon) can significantly improve your personal security.
