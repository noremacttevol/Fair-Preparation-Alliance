**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** The next month’s goals: (a) **Integrate the Skill Wheel with the Merit system** – as members earn points for skill acquisition, the wheel will update; conversely, highlight high-need skills on the wheel to incentivize training in those areas (e.g., “Electronics repair skills are low alliance-wide – bonus merit points for completing that training”). (b) **Squad Composition Tool**: we are deploying a feature where you can input a list of members and it will output a “squad readiness score” or suggest which additional roles are needed to make it balanced. This will aid new squads forming and existing ones to recruit for missing roles. (c) Begin an **FPA Cross-Training Program**: Because the wheel exposed some single points of failure (only one person in a chapter with a certain skill), we plan to have those individuals train at least one other member as backup (e.g., if only one person knows how to run the shortwave radio, they’ll mentor another). Additionally, we will refine the skill categories and possibly add soft skills (negotiation, mental health first aid) to the wheel. By day 30, we also aim to publish a **Role Handbook** – a guide for each defined role (what the responsibilities are, what training is recommended), giving members a clear pathway to excel in a role. Ultimately, this will feed into leadership development for those who want to head specific units or projects. We expect within the month to see at least a dozen more teams
