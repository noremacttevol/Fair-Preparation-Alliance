- Join coordination groups (which leads to the next milestone, VOAD) – many NGOs coordinate through those, and having FPA present as a member solidifies these partnerships.
**Contingency Plan:** If any NGO is hesitant or territorial, focus on informal cooperation. We don’t need a signed pact to help Red Cross at a shelter; squads can just show up and volunteer under their direction if that’s what it takes (with proper identification as FPA, to build our brand quietly). Should a partner NGO pull out of an area or be overwhelmed, FPA can step up to fill the void temporarily (with caution not to promise services we can’t sustain long-term). If misunderstandings arise (e.g., someone in an NGO thinks FPA overstepped), arrange a debrief to clear the air and adjust. We will maintain our principle of acting in the survivors’ best interest – not ego – so we’ll yield command when needed and lead when no one else shows up. If an NGO partner is not present in a disaster, that’s a sign for FPA to possibly carry that torch locally until they arrive (for example, if no Red Cross yet and people need shelter, an FPA squad might run a pop-up shelter but then happily hand it off once Red Cross comes, keeping relations positive). In essence, flexibility and courtesy will guide partnerships even if formal MOUs aren’t in place everywhere.
