FPA’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) is a comprehensive set of guidelines and protocols that dictate how the Alliance operates on a day-to-day basis and in emergencies. Initially compiled in the FPA_SOP_Mk1Mod3 document, the SOP covers everything from communication etiquette to chain-of-command in various scenarios. Every member is expected to be familiar with the SOP, as it provides the playbook for coordinated action and reduces confusion when quick decisions are needed. Some key elements of the SOP include:  
Communication Protocols: Detailing how and when to use different channels. For example, in normal times (Phase 1), important alerts might go out via a secure messaging app or email tree at specified check-in times. In crises (Phase 2), it dictates using the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] as primary and ham radio as secondary, with specific call signs and brevity codes (as elaborated in [[Communication Protocols and Etiquette]]).  
Alert Levels and Activation: The SOP defines levels of alert (for instance, Green – normal, Yellow – watchful due to potential threat, Red – active emergency). At each level it outlines member actions. If a region goes Red, the SOP might instruct members to immediately attempt contact via designated channels, secure their families, and prepare to implement [[Emergency Activation Protocols]]. There are clear triggers for moving to these levels, decided by leadership or automated criteria (like a natural disaster warning).
