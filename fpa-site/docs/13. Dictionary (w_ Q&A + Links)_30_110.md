A: FPA strikes a balance between self-sufficiency and community reliance, seeing them as complementary rather than opposing. The stance is that one should strive to be as self-sufficient as feasible – have your personal supplies, skills, and plans – so that you’re not a burden on others in a disaster. However, they also stress that no one can be an island in a truly prolonged or large-scale crisis; that’s where community reliance comes in, which is why the alliance exists. So FPA encourages building networks of mutual aid (neighbors, local chapter) to share resources and labor, acknowledging that a group can solve problems an individual can’t (like defending a neighborhood or rebuilding a house). They likely discourage extreme lone-wolf mentality as impractical and against their fairness doctrine. Instead, they promote a motto like “self-sufficiency for short-term emergencies, community reliance for long-term survival.” Each member should be able to sustain themselves and their family for some time, but simultaneously invest in relationships and joint projects that increase resilience (like a community garden, or an FPA supply cache). FPA highlights examples: one person might not keep cattle, but a community can maintain livestock and share the yield; one person might have a well but a power outage stops it, and a neighbor has solar to run it if they team up. The Trust Doctrine helps ensure community reliance doesn’t lead to freeloading – everyone is expected to contribute
