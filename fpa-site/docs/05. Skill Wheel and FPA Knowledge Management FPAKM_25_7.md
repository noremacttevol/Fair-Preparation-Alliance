- **Qualitative Feedback Integration:** We recognize that not everything important can be quantified on a wheel. Traits like leadership, teamwork, creativity under pressure, calmness in chaos – these are critical in emergencies but are hard to reduce to a percentage. To ensure such qualities are not overlooked, we will allow **qualitative notes** and feedback in member profiles. For example, after a major drill, a squad leader might add a note to a member’s profile: “Demonstrated exceptional teamwork and problem-solving during the March exercise.” These notes don’t affect the Skill Wheel scores, but they show up for leaders and the member themselves. It paints a fuller picture of the member’s readiness beyond numbers. It also signals that FPA values more than what can be scored. This helps discourage members from obsessing solely on the numbers; they know that being a good team player or an inspiring leader is recognized in other ways.
