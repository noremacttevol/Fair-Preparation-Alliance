To drive the point home, imagine two scenarios in a grid-down chaos: (A) A fortified house with an arsenal, whose owner hears gunshots outside but doesn’t know who or what is out there – fear and uncertainty rule, maybe they waste ammo shooting at shadows or stay hunkered until they’re overwhelmed by a coordinated gang. (B) Three houses in the same neighborhood, each with an Alliance member, lightly armed but in radio contact; they hear the same gunshots, but one radio report reveals it’s a couple of looters on the next street. They quietly coordinate an ambush or deterrence: one squad member flips on a floodlight powered by their generator while another uses the radio to impersonate a larger force (“This is Neighborhood Watch, drop your weapons, we have you in our sights”). The looters flee, conflict avoided or minimized. Zero shots fired, zero casualties, neighborhood secure. That’s the power of **communication and coordination over sheer firepower**. It’s not theoretical – similar stories have played out in real disasters where communities with radios and plans fared far better than those without.
