That covers the essentials. If you’ve completed all the above, congratulations – you’re functioning at 100% of Phase 1 expectations! You’ve proven you’re not just another sign-up; you’re an active asset to the Alliance. Your reward will be apparent the day something bad happens – you’ll be ready and you’ll have a team of equally prepared people with you. But in the meantime, there’s also a more immediate reward: **Alliance Points (AP)** and rank advancement.
