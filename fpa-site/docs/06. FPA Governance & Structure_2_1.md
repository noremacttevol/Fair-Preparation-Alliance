**Circle Interoperability:** Even though circles operate independently day-to-day, they are not silos. We’ve built interoperability into the structure so circles can coordinate and support each other seamlessly when needed. This works through **overlapping roles and liaison positions**: most circles elect or appoint a representative (sometimes called a “link”) who participates in a broader coordinating council. For instance, every Regional Circle might send one rep to a National Council Circle. That rep carries local perspectives to the national level and brings back decisions or info to their home circle. Likewise, functional circles (like Comms or Logistics) exchange liaisons to make sure, say, the Comms folks and Logistics folks are in sync during a disaster.  
Practically, this means information and resources flow in a **web-like pattern** rather than a straight line. If one circle uncovers a critical piece of intel (e.g. an incoming storm or a new emergency tech), our structure routes it quickly to all other relevant circles through those liaison links. **No circle is an island**, and no single bottleneck can paralyze the whole network. If communication to the national level fails, regional circles can still connect laterally with each other. If one leader is cut off, others can fill the gap via pre-established connections. In technical terms, our governance is fault-tolerant – like the internet routing around a damaged node.
