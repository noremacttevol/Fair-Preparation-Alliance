Moreover, squads should share secondary contact methods ahead of time. For instance, Squad A and Squad B exchange a set of backup frequencies and perhaps personal amateur call signs, so if the main channel is jammed or crowded, they can still find each other on an alternate. Each squad should know at least two other squads’ designated comm reps. This way, if Squad A can’t raise the Alliance command, they try Squad B or C directly. Forming a **mesh network** socially ensures that even if one node goes dark, information can route around via others (much like the internet’s packet routing in concept, but done manually by humans and radios).  
To facilitate this, the Alliance might publish a simple _communications directory_ for members – not listing personal info, but something like: “Region 5 squads and their call signs/frequencies: Squad Eagle (Leader: KJ7XXX on 146.55 MHz), Squad Fox (Leader: N0ABC on 146.55 or GMRS 22), etc.” Such a directory (distributed offline in printed form to avoid reliance on digital retrieval) means any member with a radio can hail any other squad in their region if needed. Early linking prevents isolation.  
**Fallback Net Procedures:** In an ideal scenario, our communications might funnel through a regional command center or repeater network. But **when centralized systems fail**, we implement _fallback nets_. A fallback net is a simpler, often more local or low-tech communication structure that we revert to when primary ones go down.
