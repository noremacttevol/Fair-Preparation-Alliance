and being mindful of surveillance. On the data security front, FPA’s knowledge base ([[“Whole Book” Master Documentation]] and [[Member Skills Directory]]) is stored in secure formats with backups (as noted in [[Data Security and Backups]]). Access to these is tiered: e.g., the full member list with addresses might only be held by regional coordinators, whereas general prepping guides are shared freely among all members. Privacy rules are also part of the [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] – members should not gossip about others’ preparations or identities outside the trusted circle. In the event a member leaves the Alliance or is removed, protocols ensure their data is removed from active lists to protect them and the group. The goal is that members feel safe providing information needed for group function because they know FPA will guard it diligently. Even within the group, an ethic of “need-to-know” is practiced for OPSEC: for example, a member’s exact home stockpile might only be known to their [[Buddy Teams and Cell Structure]] partners or chapter lead, not broadcast widely. Ultimately, this careful approach to privacy enables effective collaboration (since members do eventually share vital info like skills and emergency plans) without exposing individuals to undue risk.
