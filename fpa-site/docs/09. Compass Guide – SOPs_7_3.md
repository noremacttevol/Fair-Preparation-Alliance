- **Phase 3: National Network & Full Integration.** Phase 3 is our mature state – tens of thousands to 100k+ members, an established presence in communities across the country, and heavy integration of advanced systems (while still human-led). In Phase 3, FPA could be a household name in preparedness. We operate a full-blown **“Outernet”** – an independent emergency communication network likely anchored by amateur radio frequencies (e.g. a nationwide HF radio schedule on 7.200 MHz and regional nets) that keep information flowing even if the entire internet crashes. Our AI systems reach a level of **full integration** behind the scenes: for example, real-time analysis of national logistics (perhaps helping route supplies from one region to another before a disaster hits), predictive modeling to warn squads of emerging risks, and maybe an AI-coordinated incident command system that can assist local leaders during crises.

By Phase 3, membership fees are likely $0 (we’ll have executed a transition to sponsor and donor funding with member approval). The alliance governance might even evolve to an open model where members vote on major issues (with guidance from AI analytics to digest options). **Transparency and democracy** become even more important at this scale, to avoid any perception of the FPA becoming a bureaucracy or fiefdom.
