- **Feedback and Ground Truth:** Post-event outreach is two-way in the sense that we **gather lessons** from the field. We encourage local squads to hold debrief meetings (which can be informal gatherings or over radio if needed) and gather what went well and what didn’t. These findings are then communicated back to the broader FPA network. For example, maybe our Outernet feed had great info but nobody in one town could receive it because the antenna broke – that’s critical to know and fix next time (perhaps we need sturdier or more distributed receivers). Or perhaps our messaging overlooked a segment of the population (did we forget that not everyone speaks English in that community? Did we have translation ready?). We solicit stories: what did ordinary folks do that was ingenious? What rumors popped up? How did our trust network hold up? This info is shared internally (and often externally too) to continuously refine our doctrines. We might publish a “After-Action Report” that includes community testimonials and technical analysis.
