plan illegal activities. (5) Aid and Dependability: In line with fairness, if one member commits to help another (such as participating in a [[“Test My Plan” Program]] review or responding to a local emergency), they are expected to follow through barring extreme circumstances. The code also covers interpersonal conduct: encouraging constructive communication, forbidding spreading false rumors (see [[Information Verification and Rumor Control]]), and requiring that conflicts be addressed maturely ([[Conflict Resolution and Discipline]] provides mechanisms). Breaches of the code of conduct result in a review by leadership and could lead to sanctions or expulsion ([[Disciplinary Actions and Removal]]). This ethical code is provided during [[Onboarding New Members]] and members often reaffirm it regularly (sometimes in annual meet-ups or in the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] forum as a pinned post). By upholding this code, FPA ensures a trustworthy, honorable community that stands in contrast to the “every person for themselves” mentality – it’s a key reason why preppers choose to join the Alliance. (Related: [[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]] for philosophical underpinning, [[Member Meetings and Events]] where code is discussed, and [[Legal and Ethical Compliance]] for broader societal/legal context.)
