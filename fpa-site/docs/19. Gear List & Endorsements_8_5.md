- **Designing for Low-Tech Use:** Finally, when we evaluate gear and produce supporting materials, we keep in mind that in an off-grid situation, fancy tech might not be available. So our endorsements favor tools that come with **manual or analog backups** (e.g. a solar charger that also can be hand-cranked, or a water filter that doesn’t require proprietary cartridges if possible). Likewise, our instructional materials avoid reliance on things like videos (nice as they are in peacetime) and instead include text and diagrams that can be understood without digital playback. We also train members to memorize critical procedures (through repetition in drills) – the doctrine itself encourages knowledge transfer in person. In essence, we aim to make the entire gear endorsement program something that, while supported by modern tech and AI for efficiency, could be carried on with pen, paper, and human collaboration alone if it ever had to. That is the ultimate test of resilience.
