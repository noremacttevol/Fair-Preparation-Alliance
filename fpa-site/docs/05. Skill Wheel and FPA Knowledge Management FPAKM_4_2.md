To keep the system **honest but motivating**, the scoring criteria are calibrated so that _reaching 50% in a category signifies a solid baseline competence; 75% represents an advanced skill set; and approaching 100% reflects mastery and exceptional breadth._ (In fact, “100%” is aspirational and likely unreachable in practice, as discussed below.) Members won’t receive points for trivial or unrelated activities – **every percentage point earned corresponds to a verifiable skill acquisition or achievement**. This addresses potential vanity metric issues by tying scores strictly to tangible outcomes. As emphasized in the [[Trust Doctrine]], **integrity of information** is paramount: the Skill Wheel must be a truthful reflection of ability, not inflated for feel-good effect. To uphold this, the initial calibration of scoring will involve input from subject-matter experts and perhaps a beta-test with a small group, to ensure the percentages genuinely correspond to real skill levels.
