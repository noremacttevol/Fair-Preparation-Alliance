- **Resource Allocation & Logistics Coordination:** While we have specialists in logistics (likely within Tech & App Dev for tools and within Readiness for physical gear), Core Coordination oversees **the allocation of resources across the content families and regions**. They decide, for instance, how to distribute that $100k/month budget across competing needs. How much goes to buying bulk food stockpiles (Readiness), how much to app development (Tech), how much to outreach events or advertising (Comms), etc. They also maintain the master roster of **capabilities**: Who has what skills, where the gear caches are, which region needs reinforcement. Itâ€™s like a central dashboard of alliance strength. If Region5 is short on medics, Core Coordination will note that and put out a call via Comms & Outreach to recruit or train more there, working with Readiness & Drills to get it done. They see the gaps and marshal the content families to fill them.
