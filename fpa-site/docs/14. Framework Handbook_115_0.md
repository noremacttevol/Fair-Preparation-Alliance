Hurricane Lucia hits at night with ferocious winds and heavy rain. The power grid fails region-wide. Here’s how FPA weathers the storm:  
- **Communications Hold Steady:** As expected, cell service becomes spotty. FPA squads switch fully to radio and offline mesh. Each squad conducts regular radio check-ins (as per their SOP) to account for members. For example, every hour, Squad 7’s comms lead calls each household: most report they’re okay (“roof leaking but manageable”, “tree down in yard, no injuries”). One family doesn’t answer – their battery died. Another squad member living nearby bravely (during a brief lull) heads over and finds them safe, just without comms; he relays their status back.  
- **Mesh Network & Alerts:** The local mesh network, powered by backup batteries, continues to operate. Weather sensors and user reports feed into it. The AI aggregates this: it sees 8 inches of rain fell in 3 hours – it pushes a mesh alert to those in the lowest areas, “Flash flood likely – move to upper floor if possible.” Indeed, some blocks start flooding. Thanks to the early warning, one family moves their generator and gear upstairs just before water inundates the ground level.
