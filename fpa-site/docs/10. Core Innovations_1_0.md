Even with these 12 innovations in play, our work is never done. We have several **open tracks** – features and systems in development that we invite member feedback on and will prioritize next. Your input will shape these initiatives:  
- **Mobile App Offline Mode & Sync:** We are developing a fully offline-capable version of the FPA app (for knowledge base, squad comms, etc.).

(e.g., should the app prioritize storing SOPs, maps, your personal plan?)【CompassGuide†L98-L104】.  
- **Community Barter & Resource Exchange Platform:** A system to facilitate **trading and sharing resources** among members with built-in trust safeguards (likely leveraging reputation scores). This is an idea to strengthen our mutual aid network. _Need Feedback:_ Would you use an FPA barter marketplace? What items or terms concern you (fairness, safety)?
