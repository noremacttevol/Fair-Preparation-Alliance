- _Contingency Plan:_ If people start skipping due to boredom or time crunch, reevaluate meeting content. Make sure each meeting has something valuable (new knowledge, planning of a cool project, etc.). If schedule conflicts are an issue, adjust frequency or timing – better to meet quarterly than not at all. Should the squad face a lull (no disasters for a long time, enthusiasm fades), inject purpose by setting small projects (e.g., “let’s all check fire hydrants for clearance this weekend and report back”). The ritual of gathering is more important than its format; even a group phone call can substitute if travel is hard. Just don’t let the squad go dark for long periods, or you’ll lose cohesion and have to rebuild interest from scratch.
