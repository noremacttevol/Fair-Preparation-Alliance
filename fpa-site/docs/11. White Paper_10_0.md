**Description:** Form dedicated relay squads in roughly ten key regions (e.g., aligned with FEMA zones) to bridge communication and coordination among local FPA squads. These Regional Relay Squads act as hubs, ensuring that information and support flow efficiently between distant areas. By assigning a squad to each major region, FPA creates a skeleton for nationwide coverage, reducing isolated pockets and enabling quicker mutual aid across state or provincial lines.
**Real-World Example:** In the 2023 Pacific Northwest wildfires, an informal relay between FPA teams in Washington and Oregon filled communication gaps when internet service failed. That experience drove the need to formalize regional relay squads – for instance, Region 10’s relay team now links Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska squads during any wide-area disaster.
**Lessons Learned:** Early disasters showed that without pre-designated regional leads, inter-squad coordination was sluggish and ad hoc. We learned that standing up relay teams **before** a crisis is crucial – waiting to organize on the fly wasted precious hours. Another lesson: one relay can’t cover an entire country; breaking it into manageable regions prevents overload and confusion.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Define approximately 10 regions covering the nation.  
- Select or form one squad in each region to serve as the relay hub.
