Q38: Should I get walkie-talkies or a ham radio for emergencies?
A: Two-way radios can be very useful when phones don’t work. Walkie-talkies: Handheld radios (FRS/GMRS) are cheap, do not require a license, and are great for short-range use (around a mile or two). They allow family or group members to talk directly during an emergency – for example, communicating across a neighborhood or between vehicles – even if the cell network is down. Ham radio: Amateur radio can reach much farther (potentially hundreds of miles or more). That means you could get information or call for help well beyond your immediate area. The trade-off is that using ham radio legally requires getting an amateur radio license and learning the equipment. Still, many preppers find it worthwhile, as ham radio is one of the most reliable communication methods when all else fails. [#Beginner] [#Communication]
