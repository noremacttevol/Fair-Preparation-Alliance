**Fallback and Resilience:** We have planned for worst cases (EMP, total infrastructure loss) not because we desire them, but to remove their power to surprise us. By walking through the darkness in our minds and exercises, we carry lights when that darkness comes for real. The fallback logic spelled out here – PACE plans, local nets, autonomous operations – should reassure every member that _no matter what happens, there is a plan_. And if all plans fail, we have principles and people capable of adapting. We won’t be caught flat-footed with “now what?” confusion. Instead, an FPA squad will say, “This is it. Switch to secondary frequency, implement Plan Bravo. Let’s move.” This disciplined response is what will save lives and perhaps even communities. It turns panic into purpose.
