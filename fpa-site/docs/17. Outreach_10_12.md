In combination, these unique aspects of FPA’s communications approach form a resilient, trusted, and flexible system. Individually, one might find analogs elsewhere (e.g., ham radio usage is not unique to us, nor is open-source info), but as a **package**, it’s unprecedented. We have effectively created a **civilian communications corps** with multi-channel capability and a constitutional ethos. The result is that when others are scrambling to jury-rig a solution in crisis, FPA’s network hums to life smoothly, because it never truly powers down.
