- **Robust Outernet Sync:** We will roll out the sophisticated offline sync capabilities. By Phase3, it’s conceivable that FPA might distribute a small, dedicated receiver device or at least an app update that enables members to receive satellite broadcasts of updates. These broadcasts, as discussed, could include not just static content but personalized messages. For example, in the event of a disaster affecting multiple members, FPA HQ could broadcast an emergency packet that each member’s device picks up and customizes: _“Hurricane incoming in 48 hours. [Your weakest skill] is [X]; review the attached summary from your offline card. Also, remember to reach out to [your squad buddy]. Stay safe!”_ This would be a highly personalized mass communication, using the Skill Wheel data to give each member tailored advice even via one-to-many broadcasts.
