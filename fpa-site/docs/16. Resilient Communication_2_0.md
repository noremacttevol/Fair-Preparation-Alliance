**The EMP Threat – Real and Extreme:** An electromagnetic pulse (EMP), whether from a high-altitude nuclear detonation or a severe solar storm, can wipe out power grids and fry electronics in an instant ([EMP Attack Survival: Securing Electronics](https://weloveprepping.com/blog/emp-attack-survival-securing-electronics/#:~:text=The%20most%20feared%20scenario%20is,term%20blackout%20occurred)) ([EMP Attack Survival: Securing Electronics](https://weloveprepping.com/blog/emp-attack-survival-securing-electronics/#:~:text=Natural%20EMP%20events%20like%20solar,province%20of%20Quebec%20within%20seconds)). Government assessments have warned that a nationwide blackout lasting a year (the kind an EMP could cause) might result in catastrophic loss of life ([EMP Attack Survival: Securing Electronics](https://weloveprepping.com/blog/emp-attack-survival-securing-electronics/#:~:text=The%20most%20feared%20scenario%20is,term%20blackout%20occurred)). Even natural events underscore this danger – a moderate solar flare in 1989 blacked out the entire Quebec power grid within seconds ([EMP Attack Survival: Securing Electronics](https://weloveprepping.com/blog/emp-attack-survival-securing-electronics/#:~:text=Natural%20EMP%20events%20like%20solar,province%20of%20Quebec%20within%20seconds)). In 1859, the Carrington Event’s aurora-induced currents set telegraph lines on fire; if such a solar superstorm struck today, experts project **years-long power outages** and technological collapse ([What if the
