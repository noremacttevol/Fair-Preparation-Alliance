A famous military adage says battles are won by logistics and communication more than by sheer firepower. In our context: survival is won by community and communication more than by stockpiles and strength. By following this doctrine, we ensure that our plans, no matter how well-laid, can actually be executed because the lines of coordination will hold. We align our resources (fuel, food, defense) with real-time needs through those communications. The **“tactical waste”** is trimmed away; what’s left is lean, purposeful action.  
In closing, Section 16 stands as the connective tissue of the FPA Operational Readiness Plan. It is the definitive guide to maintaining _communications-as-resilience_. Study it. Drill it. Customize the finer details to your local reality, but keep the principles uniform Alliance-wide. With this doctrine, even if the grid fails and nations falter, the FPA will continue to operate – informed, connected, and united.  
We will not be plunged back into the 19th century chaos when an EMP or disaster strikes; we will carry our own network and knowledge into whatever era comes. **When the lights go out, the Alliance’s airwaves will light up** – carrying coordination, comfort, and strength to every member. This is how we bridge the gap between mere survival and purposeful endurance. This is how we prevail.
