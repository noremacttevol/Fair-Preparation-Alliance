One of FPAi’s flagship features is **Test My Plan**, the AI-driven plan tester. Here’s how you use it and what happens at each step:  
1. **Input Your Plan:** In the app, you’ll fill out details of your emergency plan. This includes the scenarios you’re preparing for (e.g. hurricane, power grid failure, civil unrest), the supplies and gear you have, details about your household or group, communication methods, evacuation routes, and so on. The more detail you provide, the better the AI can assess your plan ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=1.%20,ai%20can%20assess%20your%20plan/)). _(Don’t worry if you’re unsure about something – you can start simple and refine later.)_
