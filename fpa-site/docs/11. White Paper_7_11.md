- _Power & Lighting:_ Implement portable solar chargers and LED lighting for squad ops. Technology detail: secure a few foldable solar panels (even 20W panels are affordable) and battery banks to charge radios, phones, and run a small LED lantern at a command post. This was crucial in one pilot where the squad’s solar kit kept their radios and an old laptop (with offline maps) running through a 3-day outage. Pursue donation or local business sponsorship for solar gear. Also consider hand-crank devices (radios/flashlights) for redundancy. By Phase 2’s end, no squad activity should be halted due to lack of electricity – plan for off-grid functionality.  
- _Mapping & GIS:_ Use free mapping tools to aid planning. Even low-resource groups can access offline maps (download OpenStreetMap data or use paper maps). Some squads have used smartphone apps like MapSwipe or PDF maps to mark hazards and resources which can then be printed. Where internet is available, maintain a shared Google Map with pins for key locations (that can be accessed on phones). By integrating simple GIS, squads can visualize data (like which homes have received wellness checks, etc.) more effectively. Ensure at least one squad member is trained to use these tools.
