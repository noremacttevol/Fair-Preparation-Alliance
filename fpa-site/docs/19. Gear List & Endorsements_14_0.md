_This appendix defines some of the special terms and abbreviations used in FPA doctrines, especially as they pertain to gear endorsements, for clarity and reference._  
- **FPA (Fair Preparation Alliance):** A grassroots preparedness network focused on truth-based validation of survival strategies and gear. The Alliance’s goal is to empower individuals and communities with reliable knowledge and tools, emphasizing fairness and resilience.  
- **Gear Tip / Tip Drop:** A suggestion or alert submitted by a member about a piece of gear or product that may warrant review. Could be new on the market, or newly relevant due to circumstances. “Dropping a tip” kicks off the gear lifecycle process.  
- **Member Audit:** The process of Alliance members examining and testing a piece of gear. It involves research, hands-on trials, and documentation. Those who perform audits are often called **Gear Auditors** (a role some members specialize in).  
- **Gear Endorsement Badge:** The official mark or status granted by FPA to gear that passes the endorsement lifecycle successfully. It indicates FPA-approved. Represented digitally by an icon next to the gear in listings, and physically by references like in Field Cards. If a badge is “withdrawn,” the item is no longer endorsed.
