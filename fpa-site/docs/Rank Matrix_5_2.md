- **O-7 to O-10 (National Leadership):** These are the top leadership echelons of FPA. O-7 and O-8 are **National Staff Officers/Directors** who hold significant nationwide responsibilities (for example, one might be the National Communications Officer, another the Training Director, etc.). They implement strategy across all regions and often lead nationwide missions or programs. These positions might be appointed by the Alliance Commander and board, based on expertise, or elected by a congress of members – the validation at this level is high (board signoff or full membership vote). O-9 is the **Deputy Alliance Commander** (or equivalent title such as Vice-Commander) – effectively second-in-command of the entire organization, usually elected by the full membership or appointed as a running mate to the Alliance Commander. O-10 is the **Alliance Commander**, the top leader who sets the vision and leads the Alliance nationally; this role is definitely elected by a full-membership ballot (all members vote) given its importance. Terms may be limited (for example, a 1 or 2-year term after which a new election is held).
