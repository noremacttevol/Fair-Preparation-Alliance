The SHTF stack (low-tech backups) as described is a fundamental resilience asset:  
- We encourage all squads to maintain their SHTF kits in an always-ready state. This includes rotating supplies (ensure food/water aren’t expired, batteries charged, etc.). The **gear vetting** process helps here by providing checklists and test results so squads know how often to service items or what common failure points to watch for.  
- **Activation Protocol:** There’s a clear trigger for when to “go SHTF”. For example, if communications and power are out for X hours and situation is unclear, a squad leader can declare shifting to SHTF mode. This means: rely purely on offline tools, rendezvous at a pre-set location, and operate under the assumption that help might not be coming soon. The Compass Guide provides a playbook for the first 72 hours of an SHTF scenario (since that period is critical for survival).  
- **Integration with Drills:** Full SHTF drills are done occasionally – where a squad pretends that none of the high-tech systems exist and runs through a scenario using only radios, paper, and physical resources. These drills are eye-opening and ensure that if the day ever comes, the shock won’t paralyze us; we’ve been there in practice.
