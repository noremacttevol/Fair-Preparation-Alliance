3. **Privacy and Security of Member Data:** The Skill Wheel system will hold sensitive personal information – essentially a profile of strengths and weaknesses. In the wrong hands, that information could be misused. For instance, if someone hostile obtained a list of who has low security skills, they might target those people. **Mitigations:** We treat this data as we would medical or personnel records, with strict confidentiality. Technically, we will implement strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Access to the data is role-based: members see only their own data; squad leaders might see a summary of their squad (with consent); higher aggregates are anonymized. When we broadcast or sync data offline, personal details will be encrypted or coded so only the intended recipient’s device can read it. We’ll also educate members on OPSEC – for example, discouraging them from publicly sharing their scores or posting their Skill Wheel on social media, since that could reveal personal info. In terms of cybersecurity, the system will be part of FPA’s critical infrastructure, so it will undergo regular security audits, penetration testing, and have backups. Essentially, we apply the same rigor to this as we do to protecting member lists or other sensitive comms.
