The FPA App is central to our tech stack. Architecturally, it consists of the following components:  
- **Client Application:** Runs on member devices (phones, tablets, laptops). This includes the user interface and local database. It’s built with an offline-first architecture — using a local database (for example, SQLite or a lightweight NoSQL store) that holds all data needed for core functionality. The app is designed to **gracefully degrade**: if online, it syncs data and can fetch updates; if offline, it uses cached data and queues actions. The UI clearly indicates network status and what functions are available or pending sync.  
- **Local AI Module:** A crucial part of the client is a local AI inference engine. This might be a smaller language model or rule-based system embedded in the app, capable of handling basic queries and “Test My Plan” simulations with locally stored scenarios. It ensures that even if the central AI is unreachable, the user isn’t left without any AI assistance. This module is updated periodically when online (new model weights or rules can be downloaded in small packages).
