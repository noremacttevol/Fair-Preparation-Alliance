**Contingency Plan:** If any region refuses to participate initially (maybe they’re skeptical), leave the door open – show results and they’ll likely join when they see it’s helpful. If a council member isn’t performing (missing meetings or not communicating back to their region), regions should have a way to replace them – built into the charter (accountability and recall). In the event the council makes an unpopular decision, we’ve instated a check: a petition of a certain number of squads can force a reconsideration or wider vote. This prevents a disconnect between council and ground truth. Should communications fail during a crisis (no meetings possible), we revert to a pre-agreed protocol: e.g., each region acts autonomously, guided by Trust Doctrine, until comms resume – basically fail-safe to Phase 2 mode if needed. The council exists to help, not to hinder; if it ever became a hindrance or bureaucratic quagmire, FPA members would and should bypass it and just coordinate informally until a better structure is in place. Our contingency is always to trust the people on the ground and re-center authority to them if the fancy structures falter.
