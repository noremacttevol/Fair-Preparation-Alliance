**Personal Motivation – “Why We Fight” (or rather, Why We Prepare):** Each of you likely has a personal reason for being passionate about preparedness – maybe you or your family went through a disaster, or you have a calling to serve. Channel that into this work. Outreach can sometimes be thankless; you might give a community talk where only 5 people show up, or spend hours on a guide that few read initially. But think in terms of compounded impact. Those 5 people might each tell 5 more in a critical moment. That guide might be pulled from a drawer one day by someone desperate for info and it calms their panic. You rarely get to witness the full ripple effect of preparedness outreach, but trust that it is there. We have evidence in past events: a single first-aid lesson can save a life years later; one family’s go-bag can inspire a whole street after they share how it helped them. Your efforts are seeds. Not all will sprout immediately, but some will grow into strong trees that withstand storms.
