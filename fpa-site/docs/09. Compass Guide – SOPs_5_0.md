The FPA is organized to balance local autonomy with national coordination. Here’s the basic structure:  
- **Squads:** At the local level, members form small teams called squads. A squad is typically a handful of people in the same area (often neighbors, friends, or folks from the same town). This is your immediate preparedness team – you’ll train together regularly and likely be the first to rely on each other in an emergency. Squads have informal leaders (often the most experienced member or the one who started the group), but the leadership style is collaborative. The squad structure ensures everyone has a tight-knit support group that knows their specific needs and locality. _Squads know their area best and can respond fastest when something happens nearby._
