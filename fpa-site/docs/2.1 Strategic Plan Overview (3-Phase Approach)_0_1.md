comms network to maintain contact when mainstream channels fail – and ramping up coordinated support: members share resources more actively, rally at predetermined safe points ([[Rally Points and Evacuation Plans]]), and initiate mutual aid protocols ([[Mutual Aid Among Members]]). Phase 2 is about survival and continuity; FPA operates as an independent support system, often in parallel to or filling gaps left by official emergency response. Phase 3 is envisioned as the post-crisis outreach and rebuilding phase: once immediate survival is secured, FPA leverages its organization to help rebuild community resilience and spread vital information. A hallmark of Phase 3 is the [[Outernet (Phase 3 Media Layer)]] – a podcasting/broadcasting and entertainment layer that sits atop Realnet to deliver news, education, and morale-boosting content to surviving communities. During Phase 3, FPA may engage more openly with non-members to foster recovery (for instance, hosting community barter markets, aiding reconstruction projects, or broadening the alliance to include more of the public who have now seen the value of preparedness). Throughout all phases, many fundamentals remain constant (training, ethical conduct, trust). Transition triggers between phases are clearly defined in FPA’s playbook. For example, a Phase 2 trigger might be a “Black Sky Event” (total grid failure) or declaration of martial law – events that indicate it’s time to activate the Realnet and emergency plans. The
