and Ethics]] or fails to fulfill their role (such as a local comms officer not running scheduled [[Communication Drills and Exercises]]) can be gently reassigned or, if necessary, removed from that responsibility in favor of someone more reliable ([[Disciplinary Actions and Removal]] covers serious cases). FPA’s culture encourages open communication up and down the chain: members should feel comfortable asking leaders for rationale behind decisions (why are we doing X), and leaders are expected to explain (without breaching any needed OPSEC). In meetings or on internal forums, constructive criticism is welcomed. For example, after a training event, members might openly discuss what leadership could have done better, and leadership will acknowledge valid points. This feedback loop is formalized in some chapters with periodic “hotwash” sessions (post-exercise debriefs) and suggestion channels ([[Member Feedback and Involvement in Decisions]] is part of governance). By having these accountability and transparency practices, FPA ensures that power is not abused and that the Alliance continuously self-corrects. It reinforces trust – everyone knows that secret agendas or freeloading won’t be allowed to fester. (See also: [[Decision-Making Process]] for how decisions are communicated, and [[Continuous Improvement and AARs]] for how lessons are captured for accountability.)
