Finally, it’s important how we present and use these AI-driven insights within FPA’s culture. **Survivability scores will not be treated as a public ranking or judgment of a person’s worth.** They are a private developmental tool. We will communicate clearly to members that a lower score is not something to be ashamed of – it’s an opportunity to improve – and that these scores are kept private to the member (and perhaps their immediate team leaders or mentors). We will avoid any scenario where members start comparing scores (“I’m 80%, you’re only 60%”) as that could undermine teamwork. In fact, to prevent any “gamification” or competition around the survivability number, it may be displayed less prominently than the Skill Wheel itself. The wheel, which provides granular detail, remains the primary visual indicator on a profile. The survivability percentage might live in a personal dashboard or report view. This way, the emphasis stays on improving specific skills rather than chasing a composite number.
