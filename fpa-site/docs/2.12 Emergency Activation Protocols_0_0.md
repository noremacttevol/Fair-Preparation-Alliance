When a crisis strikes or appears imminent, FPA follows a set of predefined activation protocols to mobilize the network quickly and efficiently. Activation Triggers: The SOP defines what events trigger an official “activation.” Some triggers are obvious and external (e.g., a natural disaster warning like a Category 5 hurricane forecast, an earthquake occurring, the declaration of martial law, a widespread cyberattack causing grid failure). Others might be internal decisions (e.g., leadership assesses rising civil unrest and declares a Phase 2 activation proactively). In practice, chapters don’t wait for top-down orders if communications are down; they have criteria: “If X happens and you cannot reach anyone, assume activation and follow your training.” Alert System: Upon activation, an alert is sent out via all available channels. In Phase 1 times, this could be a group text with a specific codeword or phrase the members recognize as an emergency signal (something like “FLASH Protocol Red” or any agreed term). The [[Communication Strategy and Layers]] ensures redundancy – if cell networks are unreliable, the alert might go via radio broadcast at a scheduled time (FPA has pre-arranged times for emergency check-ins). Some members may have loud sirens or alarms (like a distinctive car horn pattern) to alert nearby members if needed. Immediate Actions: Each member has a checklist of immediate actions upon receiving an activation notice: secure their home and family, grab go-bags
