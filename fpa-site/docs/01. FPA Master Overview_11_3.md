- **Elections & Leadership Accountability:** Governance & Oversight manages the **election processes** for any elected positions (some alliances elect regional heads or council members democratically from the membership). They set up the secure voting system (with Tech’s help) and ensure fairness (one member, one vote weighted by any agreed system). They also define term limits or rotation policies to prevent a stagnant leadership. If officers are appointed, they might require confirmation hearings or votes. And if there’s a motion of no-confidence against a leader, Governance oversees that process too. They ensure that leaders at all levels remain **accountable to members** – no one is above the Alliance. For instance, they might oversee periodic performance reviews of officers, where subordinates can give feedback anonymously, and summarize that to the officer with required improvements. If someone in power abuses their position, Governance steps in to discipline or remove them per our code. This content family might also maintain an **ombudsman** role: a person or committee where any member can confidentially report issues (harassment, unfair treatment, etc.) and trust it will be addressed.
