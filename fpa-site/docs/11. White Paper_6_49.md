- Invite officials to observe one of your drills or meetings. Seeing is believing – when they see a dozen neighbors putting on safety gear and executing a search drill professionally, it often flips any doubts. Maintain periodic contact (maybe send a quarterly short update of your activities to the EM office). This keeps you on their radar in a positive way.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ Some jurisdictions may be bureaucratic or even hostile to outside volunteer groups (concerns about liability or control). If doors remain closed, don’t despair. Continue training and preparing on your own; in an actual event you can still act to help your neighbors, just with the understanding you might not get official tasks. Always operate within the law and safety – for example, do not cross police lines or ignore evacuation orders thinking you know better. If you’ve tried integration but gotten nowhere, focus on being a well-oiled independent unit and use any _indirect_ channels to coordinate (like relaying information to responders via 911 or known contacts). Also, consider aligning with CERT officially if available – being part of an existing program can grant legitimacy. Remember, many officials initially underestimate volunteers but change tune when volunteers prove effective – so keep at it.
