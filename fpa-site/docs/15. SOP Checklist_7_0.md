#### Readiness Validation Tags Added  
Each SOP step now carries embedded validation references:  
- **[[TERM:Skill Wheel]]**: Tags tier-specific capability check before execution.
- **[[TERM:TMP]]**: Auto-linked to post-action scenario eval and readiness backtesting.
- **[[TERM:OpCheck]]**: Required before and after all mission-type SOPs.  
This ensures SOP items can’t be “checked off” unless they reflect verified readiness protocols. TMP scenarios will auto-flag any skipped OpCheck or unacknowledged Skill Wheel variance.
