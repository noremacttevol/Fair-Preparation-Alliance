- Maintain periodic contact as they grow. Set a timeline – perhaps a 6-month mentorship period after which they should be self-sustaining but with enduring camaraderie. Celebrate their milestones as well (when they do their first solo drill or secure a base, give them a shout-out on your social media or newsletter). This positive reinforcement fuels the cycle.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If your squad is still small or stretched thin, mentorship can simply mean sharing knowledge remotely (emails, forwarding relevant FPA Compass Guide sections, etc.) without heavy time commitment. Even that can prevent another group from floundering. If a budding squad fails to launch despite help, analyze why (lack of interest, local obstacles) but don’t get discouraged. Try a different approach or a different community later. Not every attempt will succeed, but each has learning value. Avoid overextending your own team’s energy – ensure core readiness at home isn’t compromised by helping others. Phase 2’s primary goal is still your local squad’s full development; mentorship should enhance, not detract from that.
