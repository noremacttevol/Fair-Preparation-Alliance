Q9: What is a Bug-Out Bag and what goes in it?
A: A Bug-Out Bag (BOB) is a prepared emergency kit packed to sustain you for at least 72 hours when you have to evacuate. It’s essentially a grab-and-go bag for worst-case scenarios. A typical BOB includes water (and a filter), non-perishable food for a few days, a first aid kit, essential medications, a change of clothes, a flashlight, knife or multi-tool, fire-starting supplies, and important documents. It may also have shelter items like a tarp or emergency blanket and means of communication (radio). The bag is kept ready in advance so you can “bug out” at a moment’s notice. In short, a BOB contains all the basic necessities to keep you alive and functional away from home for a short period. [#Beginner] [#Logistics]
