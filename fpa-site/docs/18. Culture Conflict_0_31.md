With conflicts identified and brought into the open through these means, FPA then proceeds with structured processes to resolve them. Below we outline the step-by-step procedures for different scopes of conflict, from the smallest peer dispute to movement-wide reflections.  
IV. Conflict Resolution Processes and Escalation Pathways  
Conflicts in FPA are handled through clear, step-by-step processes that ensure fairness and thoroughness. We outline three levels of process: (1) Resolving Peer Conflicts within Squads, (2) Escalation Pathways for conflicts that span across Circles or cannot be resolved at lower levels, and (3) Movement-Level Critique & Collective Reflection for addressing broad, systemic issues or learning from conflicts Alliance-wide. Each process is described with detailed steps, and visual process charts can be derived from these descriptions.  
Process 1: Peer Conflict Resolution Within a Squad  
This process is used for interpersonal or small-group conflicts that are contained within a single squad or working team. The goal is to resolve the issue at the team level through dialogue and mediation, maintaining team cohesion and trust.
