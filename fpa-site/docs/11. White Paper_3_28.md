**Phase1.6: Implement a mentorship & skill-sharing system so each new member is paired with an experienced member by 2025.**
_Real-world example:_ Preparedness can be daunting alone. Having a “battle buddy” dramatically increases follow-through. For instance, in 2024 we piloted a mentorship program: a new member in Detroit was paired with a veteran member in Pennsylvania who had gone through the 2003 blackout. Through weekly check-ins, the new member was guided to assemble his first emergency kit and pass his HAM exam within months – something he admitted he would have procrastinated on without accountability. In another case, a single mother in Kansas was mentored by an EMT in the FPA; the mentor walked her through creating a family fire escape plan and even spoke to her teenage kids (who were more likely to listen to an outside “coach”). The result: that family successfully evacuated from a kitchen fire because they had practiced it twice before. These examples show the power of mentorship: it turns online advice into real action through human connection and pressure (the good kind). By the end of Phase1, every incoming FPA member should have at least one connection to lean on – we’re building a culture where _no one prepares in isolation_.
