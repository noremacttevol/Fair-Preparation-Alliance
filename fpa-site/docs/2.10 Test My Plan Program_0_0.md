“Test My Plan” is an FPA initiative designed to rigorously evaluate and improve individual members’ emergency plans through collective feedback and simulation. The premise is that every member or family in FPA should have a personalized plan for likely scenarios (house fire, evacuation from city, sheltering during a storm, etc.), and rather than leave those plans untested until a real crisis, FPA conducts structured “dry runs” with the help of fellow members. Here’s how the program typically works: a member volunteers their plan for testing (often one scenario at a time, like “my fire evacuation plan” or “my plan for a two-week grid outage”). They share the outline of their plan with a small Plan Review Team – usually 2-4 other FPA members who are briefed as evaluators. These reviewers look for obvious gaps or issues first on paper, then the real test begins. Simulated Activation: At an unannounced time (to mimic the unexpected nature of emergencies), the Plan Review Team or chapter leadership will initiate the scenario for the volunteer. For example, they might send a coded message or call: “Test My Plan: House Fire.” Upon receiving this, the member knows to treat it as if their house were on fire at that moment. They then go through the motions: ensuring family is alerted (perhaps actually doing a fire drill with their household), grabbing their go-bag, and executing their evacuation route to their designated safe spot (like a neighbor’s yard or a specific street corner).
