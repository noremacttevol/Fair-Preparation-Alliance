- Organize regional training workshops for communication leads covering HAM radio operation, basic radio repair, Outernet device setup, and message logging.  
- Assist volunteers in obtaining HAM radio licenses (Technician and ideally General class) by providing study materials, coordinating group exam sessions, or reimbursement of the $15 exam fee for those who need it[theprepared.com](https://theprepared.com/survival-skills/guides/beginners-guide-amateur-ham-radio-preppers/#:~:text=depend%20on%20the%20electrical%20and,data%20grid)[theprepared.com](https://theprepared.com/survival-skills/guides/beginners-guide-amateur-ham-radio-preppers/#:~:text=strikes%20when%20someone%20in%20your,a%20medical%20emergency%20while%20camping).  
- For areas with low HAM uptake, train members on license-free alternatives (GMRS/FRS radios) as interim solutions, with a path to upgrade to HAM when possible.  
- Implement a “buddy system” where less experienced comms volunteers are paired with veteran HAM operators from Phase 2 squads for mentorship and on-air practice.  
- Create a communications SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) booklet – printed and digital – for regional leads, covering how to handle message traffic, use phonetic alphabet, and coordinate with other regions.  
- Encourage each region’s comms team to hold monthly on-air training nets open to all FPA members, bolstering overall radio proficiency across squads.
