- _Lessons Learned:_ A plan is not a one-and-done. **Aggressive realism** means confronting where your plan hasn’t met the ground truth. Regular evaluation prevents stagnation and catches complacency. It also is good practice for Phase 3, where evaluation and refinement at a larger scale will occur. **Lesson:** Schedule time to reflect and improve. Phase 2 is iterative – loop back on earlier milestones to see if they hold up. For example, maybe after doing many drills, your initial risk assessment (Milestone 9) needs an update or you have new priorities. Continual improvement is itself a milestone to cultivate.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Set a timeline for formal plan reviews (e.g., every 6 months, or at least at Phase 2 completion if that’s defined). Put it on the meeting calendar so it isn’t overlooked.  
- Before the review meeting, gather input from members: what milestones do they feel are lagging? What problems or opportunities have arisen that aren’t addressed in the plan? Maybe distribute a short survey or just ask for open feedback in prior meetings.  
- During the evaluation, go through each major section (recruitment, training, comms, etc.). Mark achievements (celebrate them – it’s motivating to see progress), and list shortfalls. For each shortfall, diagnose why: was it lack of time, resources, or interest? Or a wrong approach? Adjust the plan accordingly – maybe reprioritize or find an alternative strategy.
