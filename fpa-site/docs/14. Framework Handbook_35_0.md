The SHTF Bible is a collective effort:  
- We aggregated existing reputable resources (FEMA guides, Red Cross manuals, military field manuals like FM 21-76 survival guide, medical handbooks) and distilled the relevant parts. Rather than reinvent the wheel, FPA stands on the shoulders of these giants but filters and adapts the advice to civil community context. For example, a military manual might assume certain gear (like tourniquets or specific radios) – the SHTF Bible provides civilian alternatives using common items.  
- Seasoned FPA members and subject experts wrote original sections where gaps existed or where our philosophy differs. For instance, a lot of prepper literature online focuses on lone-wolf survival; our experts rewrote those concepts for a team setting, emphasizing cooperation. Another example: we added an entire section on “Fair Resource Distribution” (consistent with our trust doctrine and dynamic pricing ethos) that you won’t find in standard survival books.
