- **Validation:** To progress out of Phase I, the member must demonstrate grasp of the basics. This often involves a check ride or evaluation drill (“Test My Plan” can be involved here — e.g., the recruit drafts a simple emergency plan and the squad/AI evaluates it). If the recruit shows good awareness, follows safety protocols, and understands how to act within a team, they are cleared to Phase II. There may also be a small knowledge test on SOPs and the Trust Doctrine to ensure theoretical understanding.  
_Phase I output:_ An oriented member who can function as part of a squad, with foundational knowledge and a commitment to FPA values.
