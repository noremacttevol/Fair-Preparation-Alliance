- _Contingency Plan:_ If PPE is scarce, do an honest triage of tasks – the squad should not perform high-risk operations (like heavy search & rescue in rubble or firefighting) without appropriate protection. It’s better to cordon off hazards and alert professionals than become additional victims. If members are overly eager and prone to risk-taking, have frank discussions using real case studies of volunteer injuries to underline the point. In the adrenaline of a crisis, it’s easy to slip – that’s why ingraining safety habits in calm times is critical. Should an injury occur despite precautions, have a protocol: administer first aid (you’re trained now), and know how to call in external help or evacuate the injured member.  
14. **Milestone 14: Conduct the First Squad Drill**  
- _Real-World Example:_ Six weeks after forming, a neighborhood squad carried out a simple evening drill: a “missing child in a storm” scenario. They split into pairs, searched the area with flashlights and walkie-talkies, and treated it like a real event. They uncovered a lot of kinks – confusion on radio protocol, two people went to the wrong location, one member realized their flashlight batteries were dead. But that’s exactly why they did it. Afterward, over hot cocoa, they debriefed with brutal honesty and laughter, fixing those errors. The next drill a month later (simulating a house fire evacuation) went markedly smoother, showing clear improvement.
