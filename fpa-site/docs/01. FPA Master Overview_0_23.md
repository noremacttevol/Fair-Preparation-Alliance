There is ongoing accountability: officers can be demoted or relieved of duty if they underperform or violate trust, just like in the military. They serve at the pleasure of the Alliance and its members. We’re not creating a power elite; we’re filling necessary command roles with the right people. Officers are servant-leaders in principle.  
E-10 (Honorary Rank): FPA also has a special designation often called E-10. This isn’t a rank you test into or progress to by default; it’s more of a badge of honor – a custom merit title for extraordinary service or unique contributions that don’t fit the normal ladder. For example, if a long-time E-9 literally “wrote the book” on disaster medicine for FPA but doesn’t wish to take an officer position, we might award them an honorary “E-10” title (sometimes nicknamed Alliance Master or Chief). E-10s are living legends in our Alliance – they carry weight equivalent to an officer in many respects, but their role is more advisory or inspirational. We don’t hand these out lightly; perhaps only a handful of E-10s will ever exist at one time. It’s a way to recognize merit beyond the normal scale.
