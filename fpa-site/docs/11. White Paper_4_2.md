- **Technology Failures (e.g., FPA app outage):** Phase1 leans on tools like the FPA app, AI chatbot, etc., which themselves could fail (servers crash, cyber attack, etc.). Contingency: all critical info and tools have offline equivalents. We have the _Offline System_ – a set of downloadable or printable guides covering how to run “Test My Plan” manually, printed lists of radio frequencies, etc. Every member is urged to keep a hard copy of key documents (like this roadmap’s highlights, Compass Guide, emergency contacts). If the FPA app’s _Test My Plan_ goes down the week you want to use it, use the paper version or discuss scenarios with your mentor as a manual simulation. For the FPAi Chatbot, contingency is old-fashioned Q&A: consult the FPA Dictionary (it’s offline-capable) or radio an experienced member for advice. We will also establish an email or phone hotline for critical support if the fancy app is unavailable. In essence, **nothing in Phase1 should ever hinge on a single technology.** We always have a backup method, often analog. Members are encouraged to practice using these low-tech backups too, so it’s not foreign when needed.
