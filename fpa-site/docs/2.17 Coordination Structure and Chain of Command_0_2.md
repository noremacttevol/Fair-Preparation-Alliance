example, preventing conflict if two chapters head for the same resource, or organizing a multi-chapter evacuation convoy). Functional Roles: Within each group, certain functional roles are recognized which create a sort of horizontal chain of command in their domain. For instance, the Communication Lead is “in charge” of network operations – if they say “switch to backup frequency” or “communications silence for the next hour except emergency,” members heed that regarding comms. Similarly, a Medical Lead can direct others when treating casualties (“You, apply pressure here; you, go boil water”). This respect for expertise means in a given moment, the person with the relevant know-how leads that task, even if they’re not the overall chapter lead. The chapter lead coordinates these roles, ensuring they integrate (like confirming with the medical lead where to set up a sick bay, or with security lead how to organize watches). Decision Making and Orders: The chain of command is used to make decisions efficiently. In calm times FPA is quite democratic, but in a crisis, if the chapter lead says “We’re bugging out now,” members follow that directive for the sake of group safety – they can discuss disagreements later when safe. This is understood as part of the Trust Doctrine: trusting the appointed leader’s judgment in critical moments. However, leaders are expected to listen to advisors (e.g., if the security lead strongly objects to an order due to immediate danger, the chapter
