Strangers at Rally Points: There’s always a possibility a stranger could wander into an FPA rally or safe zone asking for help. FPA instructs members to handle such situations cautiously but humanely. If the stranger is non-threatening and truly in need (say, an injured person or a lost child), members will provide basic assistance (medical aid, a bit of food or water, directions). But they will likely not bring a stranger into the center of their group’s hideout unless absolutely necessary. One technique is establishing a buffer zone: meet the stranger a little away from the main camp to gauge them and help without revealing the camp’s size or assets. If the person is traveling on, FPA might give them a small aid package and send them on their way with advice. If the person poses potential risk or is prying (asking about stockpiles, group size, etc.), FPA members politely but firmly limit interaction and may relocate shortly after to avoid giving away their position.
