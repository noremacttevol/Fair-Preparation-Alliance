E-1 to E-3 (Junior Members): These are the junior members learning the ropes. They focus on individual skills and supporting their squad. Think of them like Privates or Specialists in a traditional military sense (though we typically just use the rank number or a neutral title to avoid confusion with actual military). They follow orders, absorb knowledge, and prove reliability. The AP needed to climb these first ranks is relatively low – basic participation and completion of introductory training will get you here quickly.  
E-4 to E-6 (Operational Core): Members in this band form the operational backbone of FPA. By the time you reach E-4 (often informally dubbed a “Team Leader”), you likely have a year or two in FPA, solid AP under your belt, and possibly lead a fireteam or small unit within a squad. E-5 and E-6 are akin to Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) – you might be a full squad leader or hold a specialized role like Training NCO or Communications NCO for your region. Reaching these ranks requires not only accumulating AP, but also demonstrating leadership and passing certain evaluations. (For example, an E-5 candidate might need to have led a successful drill or mentored 5 new members from E-1 to E-3.) The Alliance entrusts E-4 to E-6 ranks with maintaining discipline and standards on the ground. They are the backbone keeping squads and local operations running smoothly.
