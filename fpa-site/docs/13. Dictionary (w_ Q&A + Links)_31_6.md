A: From the start, FPA’s doctrine has been to focus on common-sense preparedness and ethical community building, steering clear of partisan politics or extreme ideologies. They maintain neutrality by explicitly keeping discussions and materials centered on disaster readiness, not on hot-button political issues. At meetings, they set ground rules: for instance, no wearing of polarizing political merchandise, no campaigning or conspiracy theory rants – those get politely but firmly redirected. They emphasize that disasters don’t discriminate by politics, and that within FPA there are likely a variety of personal beliefs, which are put aside for the shared mission. Leadership models neutrality by example, keeping FPA communications free of bias or commentary on unrelated current events. If a member tries to veer into extremist territory (say pushing a race-based agenda or militant overthrow talk), FPA’s trust and ethics committees would intervene – first through conversation to correct course, and if needed, by distancing or removing that individual. They also partner with a broad spectrum of mainstream organizations (like working with both a church group and a secular NGO) to reinforce that they are inclusive. By focusing on universal values (safety, self-reliance, helping neighbors) they attract people from left, right, and center who can agree on those basics. Training materials avoid using language that aligns with any radical movement; they often use FEMA or Red Cross
