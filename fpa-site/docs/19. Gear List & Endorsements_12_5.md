- **Logged by:** (Name/ID of the member writing the log entry)  
By standardizing the log format, we make it easy for any member to review what interactions have occurred regarding a product. It also makes audits straightforward; an Ethics Council member can randomly pick a gear item and check that all vendor interactions were logged properly.  
**Price Monitoring Log Template:** (For tracking pricing and stock levels of endorsed items, used by the pricing team or volunteers.)  
- **Item:** (Name and model of gear)  
- **Date Checked:**  
- **Source Checked:** (Retailer or vendor name, or if it’s a general market scan)  
- **Price/Observation:** (List price found, and any notes like “out of stock”, “price up 10% from last check”, “coupon available”, etc.)  
- **Compared to Baseline:** (Note how this compares to our baseline fair price or last logged price. E.g., “Baseline $50 – current $55, 10% increase.”)  
- **Action Taken:** (If any – e.g., “Alert flag set in system to review endorsement if exceeds 20%”, or “Shared discount code with members on forum”, or “No action, within normal range.”)  
- **Logged by:**  
These logs might be maintained in a spreadsheet style format for quick scanning. They help us quickly detect trends (like all solar panels going up in price due to silicon shortage – maybe a note to members to buy soon or hold off if likely to drop later).
