Preparedness gear isn’t one-size-fits-all; FPA puts special emphasis on accommodating all members of a household:  
- Children: Kits are adapted for kids’ capacities and needs. For example, a child might have their own small backpack with light items (a water bottle, whistle, a comfort item like a stuffed toy, and some snacks) so they feel involved but aren’t overburdened. Parents’ gear will include child-specific supplies: diapers and wipes for infants, formula or baby food, child-size masks, medicines in child doses, and items to occupy them (coloring book, small game) during stressful downtime.  
- Elderly or Disabled: Mobility aids (spare cane, walker, wheelchair repair kit, etc.) are part of plans. If someone uses hearing aids, extra batteries or a spare device go into kits. For the visually impaired, glasses backups or mobility canes are secured. Those on medical devices like oxygen concentrators or CPAP machines must plan power backups (battery or manual alternative if possible). FPA helps families create lists of this specialized gear and ensure it’s ready to go. They also may acquire lightweight portable versions of equipment (like a portable oxygen tank) for emergencies.  
- Medical Needs: Any unique medical necessities (dialysis equipment, insulin and refrigeration for it – possibly a small cooler with ice packs in the go-bag) are addressed with redundancy (extra medication supply) and contingency (what to do if device-dependent care isn’t available).
