From Fringe to Movement – Memetic Growth: For mainstream adoption, FPA needs to become a memetic movement – its ideas should spread on their own. This could happen via social media campaigns showing positive aspects of prepping (shifting the narrative from “paranoid hoarder” to “responsible caregiver”). Perhaps a hashtag campaign like #ReadyTogether or #PreparedNotScared could be used by members to share their small wins (a successful community garden, a preparedness fair at a school, etc.). Memetic success means people start joining or replicating FPA chapters because it feels like the right thing to do, almost fashionable. The incorporation of fairness – implying justice and equality – can appeal to younger generations concerned with social causes. If FPA can link preparedness with issues like climate change adaptation, economic empowerment (saving money via bulk buying of supplies), or helping neighbors, it gains narratives that attract those who might never visit a “prepper forum.” Essentially, FPA must tap into the same energy that makes grassroots campaigns like community gardening or neighborhood mutual aid cool and compassionate, rather than fear-based.
