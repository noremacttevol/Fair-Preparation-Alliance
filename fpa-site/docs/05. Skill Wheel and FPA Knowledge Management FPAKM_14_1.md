- **Relevant SOP Quick-Guides:** If the member has a particular role or high skill (say they are the go-to radio operator in their squad), include a one-page Standard Operating Procedure summary for that role (e.g. radio operation protocols, call logs templates, etc.). Essentially, whatever tasks they are most likely to perform in an FPA operation, they should have the instructions for those tasks in their packet.  
- **Training Log and Certificates:** Copies of any important training certificates, course completions, or endorsements the member has earned (if space permits). This can serve as proof of qualifications if they need to interface with official responders or just to remind themselves of their accomplishments.  
By automating as much of the creation of these packets as possible, we ensure consistency and up-to-date information. In Phase2 or 3, whenever a member significantly improves a skill or earns a new qualification, the system could notify them: _“New achievement unlocked – print an updated page for your binder to reflect your First Aid training upgrade.”_ During annual readiness audits or trainings, leaders could prompt members to refresh their printouts, so everyone’s binder stays current.
