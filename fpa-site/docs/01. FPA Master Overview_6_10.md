In summary, FPA’s rank structure (E-1 through E-9, Officer track, and special E-10 honors) combined with the Alliance Points system provides a **clear pathway for growth and leadership**. It’s a system that encourages everyone to pull their weight, learn continuously, and step up when ready. By tying rank to real contributions and maintaining checks and balances, we avoid the pitfalls of both anarchy and tyranny. The Alliance remains disciplined but dynamic, with fresh talent always rising and seasoned hands guiding. **Your goal as a member**: rack up AP by doing the work, advance in rank, and use that position to help others – that’s how the Alliance as a whole gets stronger.
