- **Slices (12)** cover Water, Food, Medical, Communications, Energy, Navigation, Security, Shelter, Finance, Community, Mindset, and Logistics—mirroring the core categories in Test-My-Plan.  
- Each slice fills clockwise as missions or lessons are logged; empty gaps pop visually, making weak spots impossible to ignore.  
- The design draws inspiration from the EU-funded _Digital Competence Wheel_ for quick self-diagnosis and coaching ([Digital Competence](https://digital-competence.eu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Digital Competence Wheel")).
