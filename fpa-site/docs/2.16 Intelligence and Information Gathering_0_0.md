Staying informed is critical during crises, so FPA has a proactive approach to gathering intelligence (intel) and situational awareness. In stable times, members keep an eye on emerging threats (news of pandemics, economic indicators, weather forecasts), but in an active emergency, this kicks into high gear. Monitoring Official Channels: Early in a crisis, members will tune in to emergency broadcasts (NOAA weather radio, local news radio, TV if available, official alerts on cell phones) to get the latest instructions and developments. Each chapter often assigns someone to continuously monitor these and relay important info to the group via [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] or radio. For example, if a mandatory evacuation of certain zones is ordered, or if a boil-water advisory is issued, they ensure all members know. Scanning and Ham Radio Intel: Many FPA members are ham radio operators and have scanners. They’ll listen to public service frequencies (police, fire, EMS) if not encrypted, to glean real-time info on what’s happening (e.g., locations of unrest, progression of a wildfire, etc.). They also monitor amateur radio bands where other operators might be reporting local conditions. FPA might have relationships with radio nets (like neighborhood radio watch or regional prepper nets) and exchange reports. For instance, an FPA ham might check in to a statewide emergency net and get information from other counties or transmit a request (like asking if a certain
