- **Facilities and Caches:** Where possible, FPA establishes caches of supplies or safe meetup points in various regions. These might be in partnership with local allies or just buried/stored by squads. The locations and details are carefully managed (shared with those who need to know) to avoid them becoming targets or single points of failure. They are a last resort to resupply or regroup if personal supplies are lost or exhausted.  
This infrastructure layer is all about **redundancy**. We assume things will go wrong and plan backwards: if the ideal tool isn’t available, we fall back to the next, and the next. Every critical function is backed up by a more fundamental method. High tech fails to low tech; complex fails to simple, rather than failing to nothing. By equipping our members with this layered stack and training them in its use, we ensure that the FPA can operate under **a spectrum of conditions from normal to catastrophic**.  
_(Figure: FPA Multi-Layer Operational Architecture – illustrating how squads (people) execute SOPs (process) with support from the FPA App/AI (technology), all reinforced by offline-ready infrastructure and gear (physical layer). Each layer is depicted as a horizontal band, with arrows indicating integration: e.g., the tech layer connecting squads to each other and to knowledge, the process layer guiding squads, and the infrastructure layer underpinning everything with resilience.)_
