VII. Sustaining Unity and Preventing Fragmentation  
All the policies described converge on a single ultimate aim: to ensure the Fair Preparation Alliance stays united, mission-focused, and healthy for the long term, immune to internal collapse. By systematically handling conflict and reinforcing culture, we make FPA a robust organization that does not splinter even under strain.  
To summarize how this framework hardens FPA against fragmentation:  
Early Conflict Resolution = No Festering Factions: By catching conflicts early (Section III) and addressing them, we stop the accumulation of unspoken grievances that can lead to factions. Historically, movements often split because small disagreements were left unresolved until they became big ideological divides. In FPA, disagreements are brought to the table quickly. This means people are less likely to feel that “the only way to be heard is to leave and form my own group.” Instead, they see that their concerns can be addressed within FPA. When members feel heard and respected, they stay invested even if outcomes aren’t always in their favor.
