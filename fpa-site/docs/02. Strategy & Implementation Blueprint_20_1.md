- **Fail-safe Modes:** The app and other tech have fail-safe behaviors. If the app detects low battery, it can automatically turn off non-essential features to conserve power for critical functions (like keeping the SOS beacon or important documents accessible). If a local server is running low on battery, it will broadcast a final sync for clients to grab any last data before it shuts off. These little design elements ensure maximum utility of diminishing resources in a crunch.
