**Leadership Signaling Tools:** In addition to code words, we use physical and analog signals for leadership if radio is completely gone. One such method is a **flag or banner system**: e.g., a particular flag hoisted at a community center means “Alliance meetup at 1800 hrs” or different colors can mean different things. Another is **pre-set sounds**: church bells, air horn blasts, etc., to convey messages (this harkens back to old town signals – e.g., 3 bell rings = council meeting). We can adapt that: e.g., if local leadership wants everyone to gather, they might sound a distinctive pattern on a siren or bell (if available). These are highly local solutions and would be decided by chapters based on their environment and tools.
