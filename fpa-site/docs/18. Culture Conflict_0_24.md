Observation of Behavioral Cues: Leaders and peers are trained to notice signs of unresolved conflict or low morale. Frequent arguments, silent treatment, cliques forming, unusual declines in performance, or people avoiding each other are red flags. If a squad lead or any member observes such signs, they are empowered to gently inquire and invite a conversation. For instance, “I noticed tension in yesterday’s discussion; should we debrief about it?” This proactive check can prevent issues from simmering. Our culture aims to avoid the scenario where people “grumble and complain but leave it to the boss” silently – instead, peers are expected to step up and address problems with each other, with support from leadership as needed.
