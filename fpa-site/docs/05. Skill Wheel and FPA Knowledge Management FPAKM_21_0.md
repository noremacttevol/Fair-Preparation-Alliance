**Scope:** In Phase3, the system reaches full maturity. It becomes smart, adaptive, and deeply integrated with AI and even external data feeds, realizing the original vision of a living, learning preparedness ecosystem.  
- **Full AI Integration:** The FPAi engine will be fully connected to the Skill Wheel system. Each member’s profile will automatically include the AI-generated survivability analysis and learning path recommendations described earlier. In the app, members might have a “My Readiness Report” section where they can see their current survivability score(s), the rationale behind them, and the personalized to-do list of training or actions to take next. The AI will draw on a wide array of data: not only the member’s skills and quiz results, but possibly their equipment inventory (if the app tracks what gear they have or if they contribute to a shared [[Gear Pool]]), their network (maybe noting if they have nearby mutual aid partners), and real-world threat intelligence. For example, if an impending winter storm is detected in their region, the AI could temporarily elevate the importance of certain skills or send a targeted reminder: “A blizzard is forecast this week – make sure your generator skills and supplies are in order.”
