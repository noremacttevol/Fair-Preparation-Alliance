This white paper is a manifesto-style explanation of the **Fair Preparation Alliance vision**, useful for partner outreach, public onboarding, or early-stage funding partners. While inspirational in tone, all referenced systems (FPAi, TMP, SOPs, readiness tiers) now exist in full Mk1Mod3 documentation. Treat this as a **framing doc**, not a source of ground-truth protocols.
