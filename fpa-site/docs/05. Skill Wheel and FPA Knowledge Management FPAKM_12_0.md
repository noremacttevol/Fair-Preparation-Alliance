One key deliverable for offline use is a **personalized skill summary** for each member – essentially a one or two-page “cheat sheet” of their readiness profile that can be printed and kept in physical form. By Phase3, the system will automatically generate these for every member (in earlier phases, they may be compiled manually). This summary, often envisioned as a **Skill Card** or part of the member’s binder (the “SHTF Bible” binder many members maintain), would include:  
- The member’s **strengths** – highlighting which skills/domains they are strong in, so they know what they can confidently rely on.  
- The member’s **caution areas** – noting which skills are weaker, so they know what not to overestimate in a crisis (and perhaps who else to rely on for those tasks).  
- **Quick-reference guides** or key tips for those weaker areas.  
- Any **immediate action checklists** recommended by FPAi given the member’s situation.
