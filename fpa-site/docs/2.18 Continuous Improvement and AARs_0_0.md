FPA is committed to learning from every experience. After any significant event – whether a drill or a real crisis – the Alliance engages in continuous improvement practices, often through After-Action Reviews (AARs) and debriefings. The goal is to capture lessons learned, fix mistakes, and reinforce successes so that the group becomes more effective over time. After-Action Reviews: Following a drill (like a simulated evacuation) or an actual incident (say the group had to respond to a local flood), the chapter will gather (once everyone is safe and stable) for a structured debrief. This might be done in person at a meeting or virtually via a conference on Realnet. The AAR typically covers: What was supposed to happen? What actually happened? Why were there differences? What can we learn? Everyone involved is encouraged to share observations. For example, in a bug-out drill, one member might say, “I noticed it took us 15 extra minutes to load the vehicles because we hadn’t pre-packed certain items.” Another might point out, “Communication on channel 2 was chaotic at first until we clarified who talks when.” A facilitator (often the chapter lead or whoever organized the event) notes key points on a whiteboard or notepad. No-Blame Culture: FPA fosters a culture where the AAR is not about blaming individuals but identifying systemic improvements. If someone made a mistake (like forgetting to bring their first-aid kit), it’s addressed in terms of how to prevent that in future
