Institutional Partnerships: To gain traction, FPA should seek partnerships rather than attempting to grow entirely grass-roots. Natural allies include: local governments (who might appreciate citizen initiative but will be cautious about liability – FPA can alleviate fears by offering training that complements official efforts, not conflicts with them), NGOs like the Red Cross (FPA members could serve as community liaisons during Red Cross operations), and academic institutions (for curriculum development on preparedness, or involving students in community projects). If FPA demonstrates value, it might even secure government grants for community resilience, especially since governments increasingly acknowledge the need for “whole community” involvement in disaster readiness. Internationally, FPA could connect with organizations like the UN’s disaster risk reduction programs or glean practices from countries like Switzerland or Estonia via cultural exchanges.
