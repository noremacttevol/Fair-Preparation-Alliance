**Relationship to Other FPA Guides:** Think of the _Compass Guide_ as teaching you **how to navigate** daily preparedness decisions and the _FPA Dictionary_ as defining our **common language**. This Strategic Roadmap is the **action plan** – it tells us **what to do, by when**, to build out the FPA vision in stages. For example, the Compass Guide might explain _why_ HAM radio is important and how to use one, but the Roadmap will set a milestone like “Phase1.1: Train 100 members in HAM radio by Q2 2025” to ensure we actually achieve radio coverage. The Roadmap won’t repeat definitions or philosophical discussions found elsewhere; instead, it focuses on measurable progress and coordination. Use the Dictionary to look up terms (like “Outernet” or “Trust Doctrine”) and the Compass for general best practices – use this Roadmap to **get things done** step by step.
