- **Regular Drills & Exercises:** Planning and executing drills is the **bread and butter** of this team. They make sure that every squad and region participates in **regular exercises**. Some examples:  
- _Communications Drills:_ Where on a surprise date, the 7.200MHz pulse frequency is used to broadcast a coded message and every member must respond via radio or app within a certain window to simulate emergency recall.  
- _Bug-Out Drills:_ Members are told “Time to bug out – scenario: chemical spill in your area.” They practice grabbing their go-bags and meeting at a predetermined rally point in real time. Evaluators (from Readiness team) observe: how fast did people mobilize? Did they bring the right gear?  
- _Field Training Exercises (FTX):_ Multi-day camping trips with scenario play. Perhaps a whole region will simulate a post-earthquake situation: set up a base camp, establish communications, perform first aid, conduct search and rescue tasks, etc. The drills get _as realistic as safely possible._ Sometimes actors or dummies are used to simulate casualties, or hired instructors to throw curveballs (like simulate hostile looters or add stress factors).  
- _Tabletop Exercises:_ For leaders and coordination – war-game style discussions where a scenario is presented and leaders talk through their decisions. Often done mixed with the AI simulations from Tech & App Dev for added realism.
