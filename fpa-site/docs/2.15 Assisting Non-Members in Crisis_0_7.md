Inclusion of Extended Family/Friends: Many FPA members have loved ones who aren’t formally in the Alliance. Part of mutual aid (see [[Mutual Aid Among Members]]) extends to these folks. So when assisting non-members, priority often goes to these extended relations. For instance, if a member’s cousin shows up needing shelter, the group will typically accommodate them if possible because of the personal connection (and that cousin effectively becomes a provisional member under the wing of their relative). The group might brief them on rules (like OPSEC and contributing to chores). This is distinct from total strangers because there’s a trust bridge via the member.  
Post-Crisis Outreach: As the situation stabilizes (Phase 3), FPA may shift to a more open helping posture. This is where the Alliance can shine publicly via the [[Outernet (Phase 3 Media Layer)]] or organizing rebuilding help (like helping neighbors rebuild homes, or sharing seeds to restart gardens). By then, with immediate survival secured, FPA can afford to be more generous and visible, possibly recruiting some of those they helped into the network for the future. But during the heat of the crisis (Phase 2), measured assistance is the norm.
