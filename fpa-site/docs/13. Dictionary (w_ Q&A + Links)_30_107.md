A: Preparing for nuclear, biological, or chemical (CBRN) events is a specialized but essential part of FPA’s advanced planning. For nuclear scenarios (like fallout from a distant blast or a power plant issue), FPA educates members on fallout timelines, sheltering techniques, and dosimetry. They might encourage each household to have a radiation detector (Geiger counter or dosimeter badges) and potassium iodide pills (to protect the thyroid from radioactive iodine). Plans include identifying the best shelter location in their home (basements, inner rooms with dense materials around) or community shelters if available. FPA likely has guides on how to improvise fallout shielding (piling earth or books, etc.). Drills might involve practicing a quick lockdown – getting everyone inside and sealing rooms within minutes of a warning. For biological events, much overlaps with pandemic prep: stockpiling PPE (N95 masks, gloves, Tyvek suits maybe), sanitation, isolation protocols. Chemical threats (like a tanker spill or gas attack) involve evacuation if possible, or sealing a room (plastic sheeting and duct tape around windows/doors). The alliance possibly provides checklists for a “CBRN kit” including things like protective masks (ideally NBC-rated gas masks for those who invest in them), filter canisters, hazmat suits or at least rain ponchos as improvised protection, duct tape, and knowledge of decontamination procedures (taking off clothes, washing with soap and water, etc.).
