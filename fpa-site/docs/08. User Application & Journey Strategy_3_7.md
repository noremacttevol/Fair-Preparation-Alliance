4. **Quick Feedback Reports:** After each of the above steps, the user gets an immediate payoff. For example, upon completing basic profile info, they receive a **“Quick Risk Report”** listing the top 3 likely disasters for their region and a preliminary readiness grade for each ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=your%20skill%20wheel%20,up%20with%20immediate%20feedback%20loops/)). After the skill/gear inputs, the app might show their overall “Plan Strength” (e.g. _“You’re at 15% readiness – a good start! Here are 3 easy wins to improve.”_) This immediate feedback loop keeps momentum and makes the experience rewarding ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=provides%20a%20quick%20payoff%20,up%20with%20immediate%20feedback%20loops-vc35e/)).  
5. **Connect to Squad:** By now, the system matches the member with suggested squads. The matching algorithm considers location (primarily ZIP radius), as well as any indicated **interests or skills** (e.g. if they checked HAM radio skill, it might steer them toward a squad that needs a comms person). The user is presented with one or more local squad options to join, or the option to start a new squad if none fit. Joining a squad plugs them into a group chat and schedule of upcoming events/drills.
