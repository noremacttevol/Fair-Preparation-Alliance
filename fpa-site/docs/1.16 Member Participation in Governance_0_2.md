an environment where constructive criticism is seen as loyalty – wanting the group to improve – rather than dissent. This participation has tangible outcomes: many of the improvements in the Mk I Mod III plan came from ground-level member insights gleaned during Phase 1 activities (as documented in [[Evolution of FPA Strategy]]). By tapping the collective wisdom of the group, FPA governance remains agile and effective. Members feel ownership of the Alliance, seeing their fingerprints on policies and knowing that as stakeholders, their voices matter. This participatory approach greatly strengthens commitment – people support what they help create. (See: [[Decision-Making Process]] for how input is integrated into decisions, and [[Sustaining Engagement and Motivation]] as involvement in governance is one way to keep members invested.)
