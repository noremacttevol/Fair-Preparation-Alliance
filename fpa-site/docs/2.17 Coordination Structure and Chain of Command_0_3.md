the appointed leader’s judgment in critical moments. However, leaders are expected to listen to advisors (e.g., if the security lead strongly objects to an order due to immediate danger, the chapter lead should reconsider). It’s not blind obedience; it’s disciplined coordination. Communication Flow: Orders and information flow down and up the chain. Members report their status or problems to team leads or directly to chapter lead in small groups, and leadership disseminates info and decisions back down. For example, if a member finds a bridge out, they tell the lead, who then informs all members “Bridge X is out, use alternate route Y.” This avoids each person having to verify and keeps everyone on the same page. Adaptability: The structure is designed to adapt if people are lost or separated. If two or three members find themselves isolated from the group, they know among themselves who should coordinate – usually the most senior or capable will assume interim lead of that small cell until they reunite with the main group. FPA training encourages everyone to be ready to lead at least a small team if needed (e.g., if you’re the only medically trained person present, you might lead that group’s actions). Conflict Resolution in Command: If disagreements arise among leadership (say regional leads have different views), FPA tries to resolve quickly via the pre-set hierarchy or consensus if time allows. In a prolonged crisis, they might even rotate leadership if someone is
