- _OuterNet & Offline Internet:_ Aim to implement **squad-level Outernet distribution by 2026**. This means obtaining a satellite data receiver (e.g., Othernet kit) capable of downloading news, weather, and emergency info without ground internet. Seek grant programs (perhaps through tech philanthropies or government innovation funds) to fund this gear; it aligns with bridging the digital divide. For instance, a grant might cover a $300 Outernet setup that the squad installs at their base, providing a Wi-Fi hotspot where anyone can connect to get curated emergency content even if the local internet is down. Supplement this with **HAM packet radio** or data modes as a backup to transmit emails or texts over radio frequencies. The action plan is to have at least one reliable info feed independent of commercial power/internet by 2026, and to run quarterly drills where the squad operates solely on that feed (to ensure readiness for grid-down scenarios).
