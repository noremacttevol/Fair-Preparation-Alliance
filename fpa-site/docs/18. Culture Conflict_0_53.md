Step 3: Open Dialogue and Critique Sessions – With priority issues identified, the forum moves into open dialogue. This can be done in various formats: plenary discussions, breakout groups, or circle-wise meetings that report back. The goal is to explore each issue critically but constructively. For example, if “communication between circles” was an issue, groups might discuss why that is happening – is the structure unclear? Are there not enough cross-circle meetings? Is there competition for resources causing secrecy? Participants are encouraged to be honest, even about leadership shortcomings or cultural blind spots, without fear of reprisal. Real-world rationale: We cite that organizations that confront their flaws openly are far more resilient and successful in the long run. Moderators (who could be trained facilitators or even external consultants for neutrality) ensure the conversation stays respectful and focused on improvement, not on personal attacks. This is akin to a giant retrospective for the whole alliance. We reflect on questions like: “Are we as inclusive as we claim to be? Where have conflicts shown something lacking in our systems? How can we better live our values?” Sometimes the hardest critiques lead to the most profound improvements.
