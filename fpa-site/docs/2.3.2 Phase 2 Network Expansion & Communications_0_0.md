Phase 2 begins when significant crises occur – this could be a single catastrophic event or a gradual breakdown of normal infrastructure and order. In Phase 2, FPA shifts from quiet preparation to active network deployment and mutual aid. One of the first actions is to bring the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] fully online. During Phase 1, Realnet (a dedicated, secure communication network for FPA) was prepared; in Phase 2 it becomes the primary means for coordination. Members connect via Realnet nodes (which could be internet-independent mesh networks, pre-arranged radio data links, and local servers running off backup power) to maintain group communication even if the Internet and phone systems fail. At the same time, the [[Ham Radio Network]] becomes critical – members check in on designated emergency frequencies ([[Emergency Frequencies and Channels]]) at scheduled times to account for everyone and share situational updates (this provides redundancy if Realnet nodes are isolated). Network expansion in Phase 2 also implies connecting previously separate local chapters into a more tightly knit web: region-to-region communication is established through relays or courier if needed ([[Sneakernet (Physical Data Transfer)]] might be used to physically carry information if digital comms are fragmented). The alliance’s organization scales up – regional coordinators emerge to link local efforts, ensuring that, for example, a lightly affected area can send help to a
