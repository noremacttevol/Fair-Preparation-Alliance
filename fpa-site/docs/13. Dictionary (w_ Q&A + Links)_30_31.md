Q20: What is “adaptive preparedness” in FPA’s doctrine?
A: “Adaptive preparedness” refers to FPA’s emphasis on being flexible and responsive in your prepping, rather than rigidly following a one-plan-fits-all. It means preparing for change and surprises: your plan B might need a plan C, and so on. In doctrine, FPA encourages members to constantly evaluate their plans against new information or evolving situations. For example, maybe you prepped assuming you’d bug in during disasters, but a new risk (like a chemical plant built nearby) means bugging out could be smarter – adaptive preparedness would have you update your strategy and gear accordingly. It also applies to resourcefulness during a crisis: using what you have to solve unforeseen problems (improvising a water filter from available materials, or converting a truck to run on alternative fuel). FPA might formalize this in training by drills where a curveball is thrown – like “assume your primary route is blocked, now what?” – to instill adaptability. It’s somewhat tied to a mindset of not being overly attached to your initial plan or gear; if those fail or circumstances shift, you adapt and keep going. The doctrine would highlight historical lessons where those who adapted survived. So, adaptive preparedness is basically a hallmark of FPA’s tactical thinking: prepare thoroughly, but always be ready to pivot and adjust tactics as reality dictates. [#Intermediate] [#Mindset]
