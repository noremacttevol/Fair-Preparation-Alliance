#### Readiness Tools â€“ Canonical Definitions & Usage Context  
> The following terms are now embedded into the FPA Dictionary with glossary-level clarification. Usage links reference their implementation in Rank Matrix, SOP Navigator, and Skill Wheel documents.  
- **[[TERM:OpCheck]]**: A dynamic diagnostics framework for verifying readiness status in context. Used as pre/post gates in SOP execution, real-time team diagnostics, and TMP-linked decision points. _See: Compass Guide_, _Rank Matrix_  
- **[[TERM:Squad Wheel]]**: A visual and data-backed matrix for squad alignment, mapping trust, role saturation, load balancing, and sync phase diagnostics. Required for team formation validation above E4. _See: SOP Navigator_, _Skill Wheel_  
- **[[TERM:Skill Delta]]**: A gap-mapping mechanism comparing current capability to elevation benchmarks. Delivers role-level variance outputs and dynamic routing cues for task assignments. _See: Skill Wheel_, _Rank Matrix_  
- **[[TERM:Gear Pool]]**: An inventory and access-control system linking authorization, elevation tier, and task-critical loadouts. SOPs reference gear tier flags; Sync Dashboard checks real-time pool sync. _See: Compass Guide_, _SOP Checklist_  
These tools are canonically governed under `Mk1Mod3 Core Logic Layer` and referenced in TMP audit trails. All definitions here match `Sync Dashboard` tags and are cross-validated against TMP output schema.
