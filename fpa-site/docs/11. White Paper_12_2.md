- Include the frequency plan as part of every new member’s orientation (maybe as a chapter in the Compass Guide addendum for Phase 3).
**Contingency Plan:** Maintain alternate frequencies in case primary ones are crowded or compromised (e.g., deliberate jamming or interference). If propagation issues (HF can be fickle) make a planned frequency unusable, have pre-designated alternates (and include a note in every transmission like “if no reply, switch to X MHz”). In case of government restrictions on civilian radio during emergencies (hasn’t happened yet, but we plan for it), FPA members will shift to local-line-of-sight methods (runners, signal flags, etc.) encoded with pre-arranged signals to get messages across region boundaries. The frequency plan itself is distributed in hard copy widely, so even if leadership is cut off, individual squads know how to find each other on the air[teamrubiconusa.org](https://teamrubiconusa.org/how-we-serve/disaster-response/#:~:text=We%20put%20extra%20emphasis%20on,no%20one%20else%20shows%20up). And if all else fails, squads use the rule: _listen first, transmit second_ – if something’s not getting through on one band, someone will try another.
