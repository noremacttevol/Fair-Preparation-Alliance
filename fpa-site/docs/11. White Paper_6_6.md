4. **Milestone 4: Establish Team Roles (Decentralized Leadership)**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A volunteer fire brigade in a rural county found success by rotating leadership – every month, a different member acted as “incident lead” for drills. This prevented burnout of one leader and empowered all to take charge. Similarly, one FPA pilot squad designated a few key roles from the start (like communications lead, medical lead, logistics lead), but kept authority flat, with the “Squad Coordinator” acting more like a facilitator than a boss. The result was a resilient team where any person could step up if another was absent.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ Hierarchy should be minimal – **decentralization** is the name of the game. However, clear functional roles avoid chaos. The sweet spot is to assign responsibilities without creating rank. **Lesson:** Spread knowledge so the group isn’t reliant on a single “hero.” For example, everyone should know how to use the radio, not just the Comms Lead. A blunt reality is someone _will_ be unavailable during a crisis, so have backups for every critical role.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Elect or volunteer a **Squad Coordinator** (or co-coordinators) to organize meetings and be a point of contact. Emphasize this is an administrative role, not a commander.
