_Member Benefit:_ The Alliance’s focus on fair pricing means you’re **never alone against the market**. As a member, you have a whole team negotiating discounts and calling out rip-offs on your behalf. You’ll often pay less than the general public for the same gear, and you can be sure that endorsed gear is a smart investment – not a money trap. Plus, you gain insight into the pricing and manufacturing world; the transparency we provide helps you understand what you’re buying and which companies deserve your hard-earned dollars.
