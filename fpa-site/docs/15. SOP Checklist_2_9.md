11. **Log your progress and stay accountable:** Keep a simple log of what you’ve done – dates you completed each of these checklist items, and any quantifiable details (e.g. “Sep 10: power-outage drill 10 hours, learned need more water storage”). This isn’t busywork; it helps you and your leaders track your development. Many squads do quick readiness audits where each member reports on their status. If you can say, “I’ve done X, Y, Z since joining,” that builds confidence in the group that you’re reliable. Conversely, if months go by and you haven’t checked off certain basics, expect your squadmates to call you out (in a constructive way). The FPA culture is supportive but frank: we hold each other to standards because it may literally be life-saving. By Phase 2, we’ll have better tools for tracking training and points automatically, but Phase 1 relies on personal honor and manual reporting. So hold yourself accountable. Review this checklist periodically – if something’s not done, make a plan to do it. Preparedness is a habit as much as a task list.
