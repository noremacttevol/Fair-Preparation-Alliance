- _Lessons Learned:_ Your members and community likely have untapped assets. From practical skills (trade work, medical, mechanical, languages) to physical resources (tools, trucks, boats, chain saws, extra bedding), **know what you have before buying new**. This milestone underscores empowerment: showing members that their day-job skills or hobbies can save lives in a crisis. **Lesson:** A low-resource community can still be resource-rich in other ways – catalog it. Also, identifying gaps (no one in the group with medical training? no generator in the neighborhood?) early on guides what training or equipment to pursue.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Circulate a simple survey to squad members (and even supportive neighbors who aren’t formally in the squad): What skills do you have? What equipment or tools could you share in an emergency? Do you have any medical or military training? 4x4 vehicle? Ham radio license? List it.  
- Compile the responses into a “Skills & Assets Register”. This could be a shared spreadsheet or even a poster on the wall at meetings. Make it visible to the team.  
- Identify key categories: Medical (first aid, nursing), Communications (tech savvy, radio license), Security (anyone with crowd management or defense training), Logistics (trucks, boats, heavy tools), etc., and see who/what covers each.
