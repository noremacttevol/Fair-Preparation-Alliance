- **Bulletin Hubs & Outposts:** In a prolonged crisis, FPA may establish info “hubs” in the affected area. Think of a big bulletin board or tent where daily updates are posted (from our Outernet feed or local assessments) and locals can come to read or ask questions. We often coordinate with relief centers or public gathering spots for this – for instance, at a disaster relief camp, we’ll set up an FPA Communications Board that is updated morning and evening. These act as analog “websites” – a central place to get the latest if you have no power at home.
