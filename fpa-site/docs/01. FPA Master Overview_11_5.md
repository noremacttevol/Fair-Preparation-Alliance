- **Legal Compliance & Liaison:** Governance ensures FPA activities comply with the law (to the extent possible for a group preparing for scenarios where law might break down). They’ll have legal advisors or knowledgeable members who keep tabs on things like: are our members following all firearms laws during training? Do our first aid activities comply with medical regulations? Are our communications legal per FCC (like making sure our 7.200MHz usage is lawful for licensed operators and not interfering improperly)? They draft waivers and consent forms to protect the alliance during risky training. They might also be the ones to interface with law enforcement or government if there’s ever an inquiry. For instance, if some authority worries we’re stockpiling weapons, Governance can provide a clear picture of what we actually do, possibly headed off by previously building a relationship (maybe a retired officer in our ranks who liaises). They make sure that if we ever do need to operate in a gray area for the greater good, it’s carefully considered and last resort.
