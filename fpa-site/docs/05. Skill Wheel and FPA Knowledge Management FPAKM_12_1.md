- **Quick-reference guides** or key tips for those weaker areas.  
- Any **immediate action checklists** recommended by FPAi given the member’s situation.  
For example, if a member’s Navigation skill is low and they live in a wildfire-prone area, their tailored page might include a basic map-reading guide and an evacuation route checklist (pulled from the _SHTF Bible_ content on wildfires). If the same member’s Communications segment is high, the card might list their radio call sign and key frequencies or channels they monitor, so others could reach them. In effect, this personal summary is like a pair of crib notes: it reminds the member what they’re good at, what they should be careful about, and gives them essential info at a glance.
