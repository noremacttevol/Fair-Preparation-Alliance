Outernet and Entertainment: By Phase 3, FPA’s plan includes the Outernet entertainment layer – even in Phase 2, they understand the value of music, stories, or news from outside to keep spirits up. If possible, someone might play an instrument or the group might sing – these age-old practices are proven to bond and uplift. If they have access to radio or recorded media, a quick dose of music or a familiar movie on a laptop (if power allows) can be a huge morale booster.  
Post-Crisis Mental Health: Continuous improvement includes checking on mental health after the fact. FPA might hold a decompress session when safe, where members talk through what they experienced. This communal processing helps prevent long-term trauma. If someone is struggling deeply (loss of a loved one, etc.), the group rallies to support them (helping with chores, giving emotional support, possibly finding professional help if available).
