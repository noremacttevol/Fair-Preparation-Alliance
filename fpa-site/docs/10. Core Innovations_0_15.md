**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** Over the next month, our focus is on **expanding categories and formalizing the endorsement process**. Planned actions: (a) Add new categories like _Shelter & Clothing_ (e.g., tents, sleeping bags) and _Security_ (e.g., locks, self-defense tools) with at least 5 vetted items each. (b) Establish the **Gear Review Board** – a small team of experts and volunteer “gearheads” who will oversee testing and endorsement criteria (with an SOP for how something gets the FPA Seal). (c) Launch an **“Ask an Expert” monthly webinar** where members can query why certain gear was chosen or ask for new recommendations – this keeps the process transparent and member-driven. We’re also integrating the gear list with our knowledge base: each gear item will link to relevant SOPs or dictionary terms (e.g., the entry for a generator links to the “Generator Safety SOP”). In 30 days, we aim to have at least 20 new items added and to publish our first **Gear Endorsement Report** (detailing how tests were conducted – reinforcing trust in our endorsements).
