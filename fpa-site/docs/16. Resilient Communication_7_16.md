By enforcing these training standards in ORP progression, the FPA ensures that **every level of our organization is prepared to communicate effectively.** From the newest member who at least can find out what’s happening, to the seasoned leader who can organize a county-wide response, each phase supports the next. Communication readiness is woven into the very progression of responsibility – it’s not “someone else’s job,” it’s everyone’s job at a scale appropriate to their role. Through ORP-aligned training, we turn amateur radio novices into skilled net controllers and prepared citizens into crisis communicators. This development of human capital is arguably even more important than the equipment we stock. People make the network, not the radios.
