**Lessons Learned:** Initially, we underestimated costs – not just equipment, but also training and potential satellite subscription fees. A lesson came when an expected corporate donor pulled out, delaying purchases; it taught us not to rely on a single source. Diversifying funding (small donations from many members alongside big sponsors) proved more resilient. We also learned to tie funding to concrete outcomes: donors responded better when we said “$X will equip Y squads and reach Z people” rather than abstract promises. Transparency in use of funds was critical too, reinforcing the Trust Doctrine internally and externally.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Draft a clear proposal and budget for Phase 3 Outernet expansion, including itemized needs (e.g., 50 receiver kits, content management tools, training workshops) and their costs.  
- Identify and approach multiple funding avenues: **Grants** (from disaster resilience programs, tech initiatives), **NGO partnerships** (perhaps the Red Cross or UNICEF might fund comms in vulnerable areas), **crowdfunding** among FPA members and the public, and **corporate sponsorships** (satellite companies or telecom firms interested in positive PR for supporting resilience).  
- Highlight the pilot success and real examples in funding pitches: e.g., use quotes from squads who benefited, and data like “delivered 100+ critical alerts via satellite” to make the case tangible.
