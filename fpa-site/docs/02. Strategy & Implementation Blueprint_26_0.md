We have mentioned the **AI Firewall** in technology terms; here we frame it as part of the Trust Doctrine:  
- **Why a Firewall:** The AI is powerful but could be a source of unintentional harm (through buggy behavior or manipulation) if not properly controlled. The firewall concept is borrowed from cybersecurity – a barrier that filters and controls flows – applied to AI. It ensures **only appropriate, safe, and approved interactions occur between the AI and our members/data**.  
- **Functionality:** Practically, the AI Firewall is a mix of software rules and policy oversight:  
- The AI is restricted from accessing certain data about members unless absolutely necessary. For example, the AI might not be allowed to read private messages between members. If we ever create an AI to analyze community sentiment, it would work on anonymized or aggregated data. This prevents the AI from becoming a surveillance tool.  
- The AI’s outputs are filtered. We maintain a list of disallowed content (e.g., it should never suggest violence except in legitimate self-defense context, never produce harassing language, never give instructions that contradict our safety protocols, etc.). If an AI response triggers any of those rules, the firewall will cut it off before the member sees it, and instead an apology or warning is shown. These rules are part of the AI’s training and also a runtime check. This is similar to how modern AI content filters work, but tailored to FPA’s context and values.
