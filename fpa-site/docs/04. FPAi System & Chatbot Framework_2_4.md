4. **Iterate and Improve:** Preparedness is an ongoing process, and FPAi supports that. After reviewing the report, you can update your plan with new info and run the test again to see how your score improves ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=4.%20,and%20see%20your%20score%20improve/)).

Members are encouraged to run a full plan test when they join, and then periodically (say, after acquiring new gear or every few months) to keep their preparedness sharp. By following FPAi’s recommendations and re-testing, you’ll see your preparedness score climb. This gamified element makes improving
