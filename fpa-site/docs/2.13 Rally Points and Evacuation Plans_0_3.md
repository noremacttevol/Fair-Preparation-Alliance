circumstances force a change, FPA has protocols like leaving behind a “relay” person or a note. For instance, if they must depart the rally due to danger, they leave a written message in a secure but findable spot (like under a specific rock or taped inside a public sign) telling latecomers the new plan. All members know to check that spot if they arrive to an empty rally. This is part of the [[Sneakernet (Physical Data Transfer)]] style contingency. Urban vs Rural Differences: In urban areas, rally points might be just outside city limits or at a known community building. In rural chapters, rally might simply be the largest member’s farm or home. They consider the scenario – for local house fire, rally is hyper local (neighbor’s yard). For regional disaster, rally is well outside the affected radius. Integration with Family/Work: Members also plan how to retrieve family or meet them. Some families might rally internally first (e.g., spouse picks up kids from school, then family heads to group rally together). If at work, members plan which rally to aim for (maybe a member at work across town goes to an alternate if it’s closer, and others know to meet him there later). These details are hashed out in [[Onboarding New Members]] when personal plans are shared, so the group is aware. Drills and Maps: FPA chapters often distribute maps with routes and rally points marked (securely, to avoid leak). They also practice getting to them (as in [[Drills and Simulations]] bug-out
