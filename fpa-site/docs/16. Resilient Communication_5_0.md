Preparedness in communications and power isn’t just a personal choice in the FPA – it’s a **core value that we actively promote and reward**. The Alliance operates on a system of trust and merit (as outlined in our Trust Doctrine), and part of that system involves **Alliance Points** and rank advancements for members who contribute to collective resilience. Upgrading one’s communications setup with EMP protections, off-grid capabilities, and interoperability features is viewed as a direct contribution to the strength of the Alliance. As such, members who take these steps will earn tangible rewards in status and trust.
