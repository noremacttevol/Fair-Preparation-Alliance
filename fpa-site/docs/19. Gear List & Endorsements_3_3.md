4. **Community Endorsement Vote:** Once the data is gathered and reviewed, the Alliance votes on whether to endorse the gear. This is usually done by a representative council of experienced members or by aggregated squad votes to ensure broad representation. Each voting member or squad considers the evidence and votes **Yes (endorse)**, **No (do not endorse)**, or **Conditional/Provisionally endorse** (perhaps endorse with certain caveats or after fixes). A threshold (set by our Trust Doctrine, e.g. a supermajority or weighted score factoring in testers’ Readiness Cred) must be met for an official endorsement. _In our example, after reviewing the report, 9 out of 10 squads vote “No” due to the charger’s durability issues and inconsistent performance, despite its good output in sun. They might decide it’s not FPA-approved unless the manufacturer improves it._ If the vote passes, the gear earns an **Endorsement Badge** and moves to the next phase. If it fails, the process may either end there (item is not endorsed and is listed as “Not Recommended” for transparency) or revert to testing if the community believes more data is needed. **Rationale:** The voting phase ensures that endorsement isn’t the decision of one person or a small clique. It is a democratic, member-driven consensus grounded in the evidence. By requiring a high level of agreement (and often involving those who actually did the testing), we make sure an endorsed item has broad confidence behind it. This step
