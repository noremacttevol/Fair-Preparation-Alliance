signals (“we’ll hang a red cloth if we see suspicious people”). This not only spreads the work of security but also helps avoid an “us versus them” scenario locally. However, sensitive info (like exactly what FPA stores) is still kept within the group. Emergency Retreat: The physical security plan includes what to do if a location is overrun or untenable: a fallback location is designated (with a route and rally time), and a signal for abandon site (like three long whistle blasts) is defined. Members practice evacuating under duress with go-bags so if worst comes to worst, they can escape and regroup alive. All these measures are tailored to threat levels. In peaceful times, they’re subtle (just locks and a watchful eye). As danger grows, they escalate in a coordinated way. By having thought through and practiced these physical security measures, FPA reduces panic and confusion if confronted by violent threats. Each member knows their role (e.g., who watches which sector, who handles communications, who leads non-combatants to safety), making the group much more resilient against external aggression than individuals on their own. (Reference: the idea of “collective defense” mentioned parallels content in external prepper community discussions. See also [[Mutual Aid Among Members]] since security is a form of mutual aid, and [[Self-Defense and Firearms Training]] for training aspects.)
