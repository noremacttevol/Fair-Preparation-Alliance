ensures those devices are powered (solar, etc.) and safe (Faraday, etc.), basically enabling the Offline-First toolkit to exist and be used when it’s needed. When members practice drills where they simulate complete internet outage and only use their offline resources, they are simultaneously following this comms doctrine. The two are one and the same in many respects: communications readiness is inherently an offline-first proposition (since we assume public comms will fail). Conversely, offline resilience is amplified by good comms – what good is an offline map if you can’t coordinate with others on where to go? So we embed offline principles: every comms plan is written down on paper or stored offline in case digital comms go out; every critical piece of info (like contact lists, code books, etc.) exists in physical form distributed among key members, not locked in some inaccessible server. Therefore, Section 16 fulfills the Offline-First Resilience aim by ensuring **the flow of information and coordination does not stop when the internet does**.
