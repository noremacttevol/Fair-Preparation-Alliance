- **Integrated Drills and Training:** The offline readiness is **built into the user journey as gamified tasks**. Early on, a member might earn a badge for completing an **“Offline Challenge”**: use only the printed manual and radio for a day and log the experience. Squads run **quarterly drills** simulating various failures (comms outage, leader absence, etc.) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=reprintable%20pre,blueprint;%20regional%20mentors%20ensure%20consistency-in74e/)) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=basics%20for%20beginners%20extreme%20chaos,no%20internet-8w14d/)). The app facilitates scheduling and after-action reporting for these drills, but the drills themselves happen offline. This trains users to rely on their knowledge and each other, not the app, when it counts. As noted in internal strategy, _“FPA doesn’t just use tech – we mirror it, harden it, and train without it.”_. A user over their journey will accumulate real-world practice that ensures when an emergency strikes, they are not dependent on pulling up a phone for instructions – they already know what to do, and have physical references if needed.
