- **Conflict of Interest Disclosure:** Members must proactively disclose any personal or financial ties to a product or its manufacturer when participating in endorsement activities. For example, if you happen to own stock in a company, or your cousin works for a gear brand, let the Alliance know before you volunteer to test or review that gear. Such members might be asked to refrain from the vote or take on a non-decisive role in that particular evaluation. There’s no shame in having a connection – our community is wide – but hiding it is unacceptable. We maintain a registry (internal) of declared interests so that when new gear tips come up, we can quickly see if any involved members might have a conflict. This way, we avoid even unintentional bias.
