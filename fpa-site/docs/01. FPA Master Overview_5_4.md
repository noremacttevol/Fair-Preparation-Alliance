- **Handling Shortfalls or Emergencies:** What if something catastrophic happens before we reach “vote-to-zero”? We’ve built in safeguards. The $100k cap can be adjusted _upwards_ temporarily **only by member vote** in a true emergency. If, say, a national crisis demands raising significant funds fast (beyond our reserves), the leadership can propose a one-time or temporary dues increase. It might be something like: “For the next 2 months, we propose raising the cap to $200k/month to finance XYZ response.” Members would vote, and if 2/3 agree (we require a supermajority for taking more money), then and only then it happens – and even then, it’s a _capped, transparent_ measure that expires. This prevents leadership from ever milking the membership without clear approval. Conversely, if we’re flush with donations or external funding, we might even vote to lower the cap below $100k for a while.  
- **Dynamic Pricing in Practice – Example:** To illustrate, let’s walk through a hypothetical timeline:  
1. We start with 5,000 members in Phase1. Each pays $5, so $25k/month collected. We operate lean – volunteers cover most tasks, minimal expenses. Surplus goes into an emergency fund.  
2. By mid-Phase2, we hit 20,000 members. Each still $5, now $100k/month. Expenses have grown (servers, some staff, lots of training materials, gear subsidies, etc.) but fit in the budget. We’re steady.
