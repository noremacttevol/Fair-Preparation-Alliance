Q14: What is “community resilience” and why does FPA emphasize it?
A: Community resilience is the ability of a group of people (a neighborhood, town, or any community) to withstand and recover from adversity together. It’s not just one person being prepared, but everyone looking out for each other. A resilient community has strong social ties and plans in place so that when a disaster hits, neighbors can coordinate, share resources, and support the vulnerable. For example, during a hurricane, a resilient community might have a volunteer network to check on the elderly, community shelters ready, and a communication system for updates. The idea is that the community as a whole “bounces back” faster. FPA emphasizes community resilience because no matter how prepared you are individually, a disaster will go more smoothly if the people around you are prepared and cooperative too.

Q15: What are the most important survival skills for beginners to learn?
A: Survival experts often prioritize a few core skills:  
- Basic first aid: How to treat injuries (stop bleeding, perform CPR, bandage wounds, etc.) to keep yourself or others alive until help arrives.  
- Fire and water: How to reliably start a fire (for warmth, cooking) and purify water (boiling, filtering, or tablets) so you have heat and safe drinking water.  
- Shelter: How to build a makeshift shelter or insulate yourself from cold and rain. Staying dry and warm prevents hypothermia.
