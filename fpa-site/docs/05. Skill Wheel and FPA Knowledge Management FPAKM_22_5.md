- **Rank Progression System:** FPA likely has a rank or tier system for members (whether it’s military-style ranks or simply levels like Novice, Experienced, Leader, etc.). We plan to tie rank advancements partly to Skill Wheel progress. For example, to be promoted from “Recruit” to “Responder” you might need at least 40% in all core categories and one category above 60%. To reach a higher rank like “Senior Responder” or “Squad Leader,” you might need, say, 60%+ in all categories and an overall survivability score above 70%. The idea is that rank reflects not just time served or participation, but also _breadth of competence_. This prevents someone from gaming the system by only specializing in one thing to get promoted – we don’t want a “radio expert” who has 90% Comms but 10% in everything else to outrank others; they would need to round out their skills to be a leader. This use of the Skill Wheel to gate rank ensures **well-rounded development** is rewarded, which is crucial for leadership roles. We will formalize these rank requirements and communicate them clearly (e.g., a member can look at the next rank’s requirements and see which skills they need to bring up). It’s analogous to how in scouting or martial arts, advancement requires demonstrating proficiency across a range of areas, not just one specialty. Of course, we will be cautious to keep the spirit cooperative – the aim is personal growth, not rat-racing your peers. The Trust Doctrine’s guidance on humility and
