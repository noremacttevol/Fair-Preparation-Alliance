- _Action Steps:_  
- Develop a basic **safety checklist** for the squad: e.g., “Wear helmet, gloves, sturdy shoes in disaster zone; carry a flashlight at night; do not enter heavily damaged structures unless properly trained; treat all wires as live; use buddy system for search and rescue,” etc. This should be part of your squad SOP (Standard Operating Procedures).  
- Ensure acquisition of minimal PPE: hard hats or helmets (even bike helmets are better than nothing), leather work gloves, reflective vests, eye protection, dust masks or respirators (for smoke, dust). These can often be obtained via donations or at low cost; prioritize them in your gear list (see Milestone 11).  
- Train on tool safety if your squad will use them (chainsaws, generators, etc.). If no one is experienced, either avoid using those until trained or bring in someone (perhaps a local firefighter) to do a quick safety briefing/demo.  
- Emphasize **team accountability**: institute a check-in system during responses (“check every 15 minutes via radio or face-to-face to confirm all clear”). Assign a safety officer for drills who’s responsible for observing and calling out unsafe acts – rotate this role so everyone builds a safety mindset.  
- Integrate mental safety too: encourage a culture where anyone can shout “Stop!” if they sense danger or if something feels wrong. Empower even the newest member to voice a safety concern without fear of ridicule. It could save a life.
