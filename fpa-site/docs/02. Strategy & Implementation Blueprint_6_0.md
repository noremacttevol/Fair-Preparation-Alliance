On top of the human and procedural layers is the **technology layer**, principally the **FPA App** and integrated AI systems. This layer connects our people and makes our knowledge and tools readily accessible, while enforcing the offline-first and trust requirements of our mission:  
- **FPA App (Offline-First):** The FPA App is a custom-built mobile and desktop application that serves as the digital hub for members. Importantly, it is designed as an **offline-first application** â€“ meaning it can run fully without internet connectivity. All critical data (such as the Compass Guide, SOP checklists, emergency maps, contact directories, and personal plans) is stored locally on the device. The app only needs to sync with central servers or other peers when a connection is available, and even then uses efficient data sync to update logs or get new content. If the internet is down, the app still functions on a local network or device-to-device via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct, allowing squads to share data and messages directly. This ensures **no member is locked out of information or communication due to connectivity issues**.  
- **Core Features:** The app provides a range of tools:  
- **Secure Communication:** Encrypted messaging and offline messaging queues allow squad members (and inter-squad coordinators) to coordinate. Messages sent offline will sync when a network comes up, or can be passed via peer devices if within range.
