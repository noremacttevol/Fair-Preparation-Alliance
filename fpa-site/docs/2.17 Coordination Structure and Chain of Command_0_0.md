During an emergency, having a clear coordination structure ensures that FPA’s efforts are organized and not working at cross purposes. While FPA isn’t a military unit, it adopts a flexible chain of command to streamline decision-making when quick action is needed. Local Chapter Command: Each chapter typically has a designated Chapter Lead (or a small leadership team) who coordinates that chapter’s response. In a crisis, members look to this person or team for overall direction (e.g., whether to evacuate or shelter, where to rally, etc.), especially if communications with others are down. The chapter lead makes calls based on FPA’s plan and incoming intel, and delegates tasks to members (like “Alice and Bob, you secure the generator; Carol and Dan, get the med kit and start setting up triage in the garage,” etc.). This prevents confusion and duplication. If the chapter lead is absent or incapacitated, a second-in-command (deputy) or an agreed succession (see [[Continuity of Leadership]]) steps up. All members are aware of who their immediate point of contact is in an emergency. Regional Coordination: If multiple chapters exist in a region (say a city or county), they will communicate through a Regional Coordinator or simply via a prearranged liaison system. For example, Chapter A’s lead and Chapter B’s lead will check in with each other via radio or Realnet and share status. If one chapter needs help and the other can provide, they coordinate resource sharing or mutual aid
