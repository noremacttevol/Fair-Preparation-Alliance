**Lessons Learned:** Early attempts at collaboration revealed some mutual skepticism – CERT groups worried FPA was a “rogue” outfit, and FPA folks feared bureaucracy. We learned transparency is key: once we showed our Trust Doctrine and community focus, doors opened. Another lesson was practical: CERT curriculum is excellent for basics (first aid, fire suppression), so no need to reinvent that wheel. Instead, we channel FPA energy into those existing courses, then layer our additional skills (like HAM radio use) on top. This taught us that **integration doesn’t mean assimilation** – FPA can train with CERT and still retain its unique structure and independence.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Reach out to local emergency management offices that run CERT in each region. Introduce FPA and propose mutual training nights or allowing FPA members to enroll in CERT classes.  
- Encourage every FPA squad to have at least one member complete CERT basic training (the 20-hour course) and one CERT member attend an FPA meeting, fostering two-way exchange.  
- Share resources: provide CERT programs with FPA’s Compass Guide or specialized materials (e.g., our HAM primer) and in return get access to CERT training manuals and exercises.  
- Adapt the CERT materials into FPA’s context: e.g., develop a brief addendum for FPA squads on how to integrate CERT’s incident tactics into FPA squad action plans, ensuring common approach at disaster scenes.
