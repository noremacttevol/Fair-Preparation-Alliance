To maintain the integrity of our gear endorsement system, the Fair Preparation Alliance enforces a strict code of conduct and explicit “do not exploit” rules. These safeguards ensure that no one – whether an outside vendor or an FPA member – can twist the system for personal gain at the expense of truth and fairness. Breaking these rules undermines the Alliance’s mission and will not be tolerated. Here are the key prohibitions and ethics requirements enshrined in this doctrine:  
- **No Pay-to-Play or Paid Listings:** As stated, it is forbidden for any member or leader to accept payment, gifts, or favors in exchange for listing a product or influencing its evaluation. This includes direct bribes as well as indirect incentives (free gear that isn’t part of a transparent test, “sponsorship” deals tied to endorsement, etc.). If someone approaches you as a member with a “deal” to push a product, you are obliged to report it. Any member found participating in pay-to-play behavior will face immediate disciplinary review (and likely expulsion and public disclosure to preserve our credibility). We want to keep our community free of the cynicism that plagues many online review sites – our word is not for sale.
