5. **Member Psychology – Complacency or Discouragement:** This we have discussed in detail earlier, but to restate in risk terms: A high-scoring member might become complacent (“I’m all set, I don’t need to train anymore”), or a low-scoring member might feel overwhelmed and give up (“I’ll never get better, why bother”). **Mitigations:** We address complacency by the design (no one ever reaches 100%, criteria can evolve, AI keeps challenging you with harder scenarios). We address discouragement by the 10% baseline, quick initial progression, and mentorship to support newbies. Additionally, we will **not** use the Skill Wheel punitively. For example, we won’t say “you cannot participate in this mission because your wheel is below X%,” except perhaps for highly specialized dangerous roles (and even then it would be handled case-by-case). Instead, we practice pairing – if someone is weaker, we put them under the wing of a stronger member during missions. This way lower-skilled members still get to participate and learn, rather than being sidelined (which would be demotivating). As for complacency among veterans, the FPA culture of continuous improvement, plus the slight skill decay for non-use, plus social pressure (seeing others learning new things) should keep even the “old hands” on their toes. If needed, we might implement a gentle decay as mentioned (like losing a few points if you haven’t practiced a skill in a long time, which serves as a nudge to refresh it). All these
