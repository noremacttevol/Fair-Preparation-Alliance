- **Layered Human Oversight:** AI in FPA **never operates solo**. We’ve structured oversight checkpoints at every critical juncture ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=%20human%20oversight:%20built,every%20level-uk477f/)).

Any experienced E-4+ member in the applicant’s local squad can help review those flagged applications to decide if the
