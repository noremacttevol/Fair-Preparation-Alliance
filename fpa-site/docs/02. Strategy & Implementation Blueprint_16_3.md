_(Figure: FPA Technology Stack & Data Flow – depicting how user devices, local servers, and central servers interact. The diagram could show members with the app (offline-first client) connecting to either a local mesh node or directly to a cloud node when available. It highlights the AI assistant working on-device and cloud, the encryption of data, and the flow of transparency logs to a ledger accessible by members. It also might illustrate governance interactions like voting or Tribunal access to logs as a distinct overlay on the tech stack.)_  
In conclusion, our technology stack is not just a set of tools – it’s intertwined with **how we run FPA**. It enables our values (offline capability reflecting resilience, logging reflecting transparency, AI guardrails reflecting safety) and provides practical means to implement our governance (like polls, controlled permissions). By designing tech and governance together, we avoid the common pitfall of technology undermining human intent; instead, tech **reinforces** our organizational structure and trust.
