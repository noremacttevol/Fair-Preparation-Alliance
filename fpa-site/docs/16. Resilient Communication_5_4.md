**Transparency and Fairness:** All incentives and points related to comms upgrades are transparent. The criteria are published so members know exactly what actions yield rewards. This clarity avoids any perception of favoritism. It also serves as a checklist: effectively, the points rubric doubles as a set of recommended actions. A new member can look at the list and systematically work through: e.g., “Obtain FRS radio and join weekly net – 5 points. Complete Faraday cage build – 10 points. Attend HAM radio workshop – 5 points. Pass Technician license exam – 20 points,” etc. By following the points, they are inherently following the doctrine. We’ve seen healthy competition spur from this, with members sharing tips on how they achieved certain upgrades to help others do the same. This is the culture we want: a **race to resilience**.  
**Alliance Ranks and Roles:** In some cases, achieving certain communication readiness milestones is tied to rank promotion. For example, to advance from ORP Phase 1 to Phase 2 (described in the next section), a member might be required to, say, demonstrate they can operate off-grid for 24 hours using only their own power and comms – completion of which yields both points and Phase clearance. At higher ranks, expectations include leading a comms drill or mentoring others in radio use. By embedding these requirements, we make communications readiness not an optional pursuit, but a **rite of passage** in the Alliance.
