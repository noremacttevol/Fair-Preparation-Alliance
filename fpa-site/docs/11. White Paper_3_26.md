- **EMP protection for critical electronics:** Use a DIY Faraday cage or bag to store backups of crucial devices. For example, get a large metal ammo can or steel trash can with a tight lid, line it with cardboard, and place a spare radio, old cell phone, and backup hard drive inside ([EMP Protection for the Radio Amateur, an Encore. - Off Grid Ham](https://offgridham.com/2018/02/emp-encore/#:~:text=Charles%E2%80%99%20testing%20demonstrates%20that%20the,as%20one%20of%20the%20layers)). Seal any gaps with metallic tape.

It sounds extreme, but it’s cheap insurance. At the very least, keep devices unplugged and antennas disconnected when not in use to reduce vulnerability ([HAM Radio Protection - EMP - Disaster Preparer](https://disasterpreparer.com/product/hamsurge/?srsltid=AfmBOor0WG-YjJneAOVOERN-xsgOiLyOxgUGaZpLZWp9W3NBHiVbp1dW#:~:text=There%20are%20a%20number%20of,the%20antenna%20when%20not)).
