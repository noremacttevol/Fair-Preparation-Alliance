Overall, FPA treats mental resilience as a skill to be cultivated. They remind each other that feelings of fear, sadness, or anger in crises are normal – what matters is working through them together. By prioritizing morale, FPA ensures that the group doesn’t collapse internally even if external conditions are awful. A mantra might be: “Keep our heads and hearts as prepared as our hands.” This focus on psychological preparedness and morale means FPA members are not only physically equipped to survive but also mentally fortified to endure and recover. (Cross-ref: [[Mutual Aid Among Members]] – much of morale comes from mutual support, and [[A Good Survival Network Can Provide Emotional Support]] as seen in external references underscores exactly this point.)
