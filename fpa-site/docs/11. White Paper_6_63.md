- _Lessons Learned:_ Information equality is part of fairness. The “Outernet” concept – essentially one-way internet from the sky – is a game-changer for low-resource areas. It can deliver vital knowledge (weather forecasts, medical info, news) when normal comms are down. **Lesson:** Squads should explore obtaining an Outernet receiver or similar offline info repository. Think of it as a modern equivalent of a battery radio, but with data. Even absent fancy tech, squads can manually compile critical info offline (like printing guides or storing files on a laptop) to serve the community in a communications blackout. Being the source of reliable info dramatically increases the squad’s value to the community.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Research current options for satellite data receivers. As of 2025, products like **Othernet** provide kits that can download free content (news, weather, Wikipedia pages) via satellite ([Othernet - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othernet#:~:text=Othernet%27s%20stated%20goal%20is%20to,1)). Identify costs and technical requirements. Apply for grants or donations specifically earmarked for technology if needed – many tech nonprofits or universities might help a community project.
