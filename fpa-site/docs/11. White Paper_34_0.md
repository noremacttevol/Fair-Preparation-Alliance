**Description:** Organize a regular Global Preparedness Summit where FPA members from around the world (and other community responders) come together to share best practices, train collectively, and demonstrate the power of decentralized readiness. This summit solidifies international bonds and spurs innovation by learning what works in different contexts.
**Real-World Example:** The 2030 FPA Summit was held in Houston with delegates from 12 countries. Workshops ranged from drone mapping of disaster areas (taught by the Japan FPA chapter) to community trauma counseling (led by FPA-France). Attendees also participated in a large-scale drill simulating an earthquake response, mixing teams from various nations. Everyone left with new techniques and a deeper sense of being part of a global family.
**Lessons Learned:** Pulling off an international conference was challenging – visas, funding travel, language differences – but worth the effort. We learned to include virtual participation for those who couldn’t attend, which expanded reach. Also, exchanging ideas face-to-face built trust that later made remote coordination smoother. The summit highlighted that some low-tech solutions in one country could benefit high-tech ones elsewhere and vice versa, reaffirming that every region has something to teach.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Plan summits biennially, rotating host countries if possible to spread the travel burden and showcase different disaster contexts.
