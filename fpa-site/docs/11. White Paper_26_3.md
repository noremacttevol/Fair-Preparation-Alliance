- Ensure the **Trust Doctrine** explicitly protects member voice: codify that major changes require consultation or vote, locking in this democratic approach for future leaders who might be tempted to bypass it.
**Contingency Plan:** For low participation issues (apathy), the council should do more listening tours and communication to make the stakes clear; perhaps require a quorum (minimum % of squads) for a vote to be valid. If we ever have a contested result (say a near 50/50 split on an issue), the council could hold off implementation and facilitate further discussion, maybe a compromise, before re-voting, to keep the alliance from fracturing. Should the voting system be compromised (e.g., an external actor tries to spam or jam our radio votes), we have backup verification—like requiring confirmation from regional leads for each tally they submitted, and the ability to re-run the vote via different channels if needed. If tech fails entirely, we revert to old-school methods: literal mail-in ballots or in-person votes at regional meetups (slower, but we’ll do it rather than let the process collapse). In essence, the contingency is always to find a way for members’ voices to be heard, even if it means extra steps or delays – better a slow consensus than a fast decree that people resent.
