Open Door and Speak-Up Culture: FPA cultivates a psychologically safe atmosphere where voicing concerns is encouraged. Psychological safety means members feel confident they can raise issues or admit mistakes without punishment or ridicule. Leaders explicitly tell their teams: “If something is bothering you, I want to know. We will not shoot the messenger.” We avoid the dysfunction of avoided conflict by making it normal to discuss problems constructively. For example, a team member who feels excluded from a decision is encouraged to bring that up to the group, trusting that the team will listen rather than dismiss them. We frame such input as loyal feedback – an act of caring about the team’s health.
