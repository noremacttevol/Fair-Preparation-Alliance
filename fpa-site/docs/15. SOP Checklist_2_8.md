10. **Contribute to a group project or drill:** Beyond your personal drills and meetings, try to add value to a larger FPA initiative. For example, if your region is organizing a community workshop (say, teaching neighbors how to purify water), volunteer to help out – even if just handing out flyers or setting up chairs. Or if the alliance is developing a new SOP and asks for member input, give yours. Or maybe your squad decides to collectively build a “gear pool” of extra supplies – chip in an item. The idea is to _go beyond just taking care of yourself_ and actively support the FPA’s broader mission. In Phase 1, resources are limited, so these projects rely on member enthusiasm. Your extra effort could mean the difference between an initiative happening or fizzling. And from the perspective of FPA leadership, members who step up like this are the ones marked for future promotion. This is how you earn **Alliance Points** in a big way – doing things that benefit the whole community, not just you or your immediate circle.
