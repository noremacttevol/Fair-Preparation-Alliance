**Lessons Learned:** We learned humility and focus: established NGOs have decades of experience in certain areas (Red Cross in sheltering/mass care, Team Rubicon in heavy labor and veteran volunteer management). FPA’s role shines when we complement, not compete. Early on, one FPA group considered setting up a parallel aid station, which caused confusion – the lesson was coordinate beforehand to slot into existing efforts. We also learned that NGOs appreciate local intel and flexibility FPA brings: for example, our squads often arrive before big NGOs fully mobilize, so bridging that time gap is critical. Trust was built by small steps: an offer to help unload trucks here, a joint training weekend there. Over time, FPA became seen not as outsiders, but as reliable community-level partners.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Make contact with regional offices of key NGOs. For the Red Cross, find the local chapter disaster lead; for Team Rubicon, the state coordinator. Introduce FPA and suggest a meeting to explore cooperation.  
- Participate in joint training: e.g., send FPA medics to Red Cross first aid classes (and vice versa, invite Red Cross folks to FPA’s HAM radio demos); have FPA squads volunteer in a Team Rubicon-led service project (like sandbagging a flood zone) to build rapport.
