**What’s already implemented (current wins):** We launched the basic reputation profiles for members on the portal.

Wins so far: **increased positive interactions** – members are actively giving each other endorsements on the platform (e.g., after finishing a project together, one might endorse another’s teamwork or knowledge). Over 500 endorsements have been made in the first month. We’ve observed that new members who quickly contribute (like helping in a discussion or volunteering at events) move up in Trust Level faster, which has created a _positive feedback loop_ – they feel recognized and become even more engaged. Meanwhile, the few cases of problematic behavior (e.g., someone spamming their personal business or being consistently unreliable in meetups) have been elegantly handled; their trust level stayed low or even dropped due to lack of endorsements, which quietly flags to others and encourages that person to either improve or they naturally find fewer people willing to depend on them. Another win: cross-chapter cooperation is improving. For instance, when members traveled or relocated, the receiving chapter could see from the trust graph that these individuals were highly trusted in their old squad, easing their integration. The **public trust badges** (like specialist
