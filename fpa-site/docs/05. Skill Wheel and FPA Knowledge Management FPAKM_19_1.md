- **Data Gathering & Pilot:** Phase1 is also about gathering baseline data on our membership’s skills. We’ll analyze which categories tend to be strong or weak across the board and use that to adjust training focus or baseline assumptions. We may conduct a small-scale pilot (for example, one regional chapter or squad) before rolling out the wheel Alliance-wide. This pilot would provide feedback on the wheel’s design, how members react to seeing their skills quantified, and whether any adjustments are needed before broader adoption.  
- **Member Orientation:** Members will be introduced to the Skill Wheel concept through meetings or training sessions. We will clearly explain its purpose – that it’s _not_ a competition leaderboard but a personal development tool. We’ll encourage questions and feedback. Early feedback from members is vital; if they find any aspect confusing or demotivating, we want to know and correct it now.
