they can get them or alternatives like fish antibiotics – though that’s debated), and over-the-counter meds. For really advanced scenarios, some FPA materials might cover minor surgical interventions or dental emergency techniques when no professionals are available, clearly noting they’re last resort. Mental first aid is also covered – dealing with panic attacks, shock, or psychological trauma as part of comprehensive care. The approach is always: do no harm, know your limits (they’d stress not to play doctor if you don’t know what you’re doing), but increase those limits through training as much as possible. In group drills, they simulate complex medical scenarios, from multiple casualty incidents to epidemics, to let the more advanced medics lead and the rest support. Ultimately, FPA strives to ensure that within each local group, at least a couple of people are capable of handling more than just a band-aid, because in a serious disaster that could make the difference while waiting for or when lacking professional help.
