A core principle across all phases is that the **user journey is designed for offline resilience**. FPA operates on a **dual-layer model**: an online layer for convenience and speed, and an offline layer that mirrors essential functions so that the Alliance remains operational during infrastructure outages. For users, this means their experience and tools are deliberately structured to work even when internet or power are down.
