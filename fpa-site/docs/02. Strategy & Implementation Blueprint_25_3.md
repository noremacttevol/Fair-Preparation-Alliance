- **Amendment & Accountability:** The Tribunal itself is subject to accountability. Tribunal members have term limits or periodic reconfirmation by the membership to prevent stagnation or an ossified power group. If a Tribunal member is found violating trust (e.g., bias, corruption), they can be removed by a procedure (likely a vote by the others or a membership vote if needed). We understand the irony that a body meant to enforce trust must itself be trustworthy – so we ensure it’s not a lifetime appointment and that fresh, trusted members can rotate in.  
In essence, the Tribunal is our mechanism to ensure **no problem goes unchecked and no authority goes unchallenged**. It is the embodiment of oversight, ready to step in to keep the FPA true to its mission and values.
