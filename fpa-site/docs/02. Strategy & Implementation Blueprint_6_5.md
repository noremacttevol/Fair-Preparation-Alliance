In essence, the technology layer provides **connective tissue and intelligence** for the FPA. It is deliberately built to not become a weakness: it functions offline, it is transparent, and it is under human control. Rather than replacing human judgment, it amplifies good judgment and helps catch human mistakes, all while obeying the rules we set. Technology is our force multiplier, but it remains a servant to the mission and the members.
