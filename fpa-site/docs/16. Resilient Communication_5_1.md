**Alliance Points for Comms Upgrades:** Alliance Points (AP) are awarded for actions that demonstrably improve readiness. For example, if a member assembles a certified Faraday cage at home and submits it for verification (via photo evidence or an in-person check by a local chapter tech specialist), they receive points. Likewise, obtaining an amateur radio license and joining the regional emergency net earns points. Purchasing and learning to use a recommended solar generator, or outfitting your vehicle with EMP-resistant comms, also counts. The exact points are determined by the significance of the improvement – our points committee maintains a rubric (see Appendix in the Gear Endorsements document for a list of “Comms Upgrade Actions” and their point values). These points feed into a member’s profile, moving them up in rank tiers (which may carry titles like Pathfinder, Vanguard, etc., depending on our rank structure) and unlocking greater trust and responsibility. The reasoning is simple: someone who has invested in robust communications is someone the Alliance can rely on in a crisis to be a node of stability, so we want to identify and empower those people.
