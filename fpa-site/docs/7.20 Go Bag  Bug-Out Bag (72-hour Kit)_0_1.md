- Lighting: headlamp (with spare batteries) plus a small backup flashlight or chem light sticks.  
- Communication: ideally a battery-powered radio (tuned to emergency stations or a group channel) and maybe a two-way radio to contact others, along with extra batteries. Also a printed contact list of family/FPA members, since phones may die.  
- Navigation: physical maps of likely evacuation areas, a compass, and the skill to use them (possibly also a GPS device if they have one, but not solely reliant on it).  
- Hygiene: basic sanitation items (toilet paper, hand sanitizer, a small trowel for digging cat holes, menstrual supplies if needed, soap or wipes, toothbrush).  
- Personal Protection: could include pepper spray, a defensive tool if one is trained (varies by member comfort and laws), and N95 mask and goggles if relevant (for smoke/debris).  
- Important Docs: copies (or originals if needed on the move) of ID, insurance, emergency plans, stored in a waterproof ziplock, plus some cash.
