**Who we are:** The Fair Preparation Alliance is a volunteer-driven network focused on ethical, community-oriented prepping. We believe preparedness shouldn’t be a luxury or fringe hobby; it should be a practical, cooperative effort that anyone can join. That means **sharing knowledge freely, helping our neighbors, and working as a team** so that when disaster strikes, _no one is left behind_ due to lack of information or support. We prepare for everything from everyday emergencies to worst-case scenarios, always grounded in real-world facts and skills (no fantasy zombie apocalypses here). The FPA is about **empowerment over fear** – turning ordinary people into capable responders through training, fairness, and ingenuity.
