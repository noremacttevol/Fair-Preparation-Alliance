Shelter-in-Place Drills: Conversely, a scenario could be practiced where everyone must lock down at home (for example, a pandemic simulation). They would go through the motions of sealing the house if needed, living off stored supplies for 24-48 hours, and checking in via comms without physically meeting. This tests if their home preps are sufficient and if boredom or minor issues crop up that weren’t anticipated (like needing a way to cook when power is out).  
Field Exercise (“Bug-Out Camp”): Some chapters do an annual camp-out that doubles as a survival exercise. Members go to a remote area with their gear and simulate that their town became unsafe. Over a weekend, they practice building a group camp, purifying water from natural sources, rotating sentry duty at night ([[Physical Security Measures]] in action), and dealing with injected scenarios (leaders might surprise them with a mock “injury” to treat or a “lost person” scenario to search for). This kind of immersive drill builds confidence and identifies gaps in group logistics (maybe they realize they need better shelter solutions or more water carriers).
