- **Community Subsidy & Solidarity:** How do we fund the discounts? Partly through the contributions of Supporter-tier members (it’s a pay-it-forward model) and partly through fundraising/grants. For example, if a water filter costs FPA $30 at bulk rate, a Supporter might contribute $40 (an extra $10 goes into the “fair prep fund”), a Standard member might pay $30, and an Assisted member $10 (the $20 gap being covered by the fund). We also seek donations from those outside FPA who support our mission, especially for critical life-safety gear. The **transparency** piece is important: we periodically report how these funds are used (e.g., “50 higher-tier members enabled 200 discounted first aid kits for those in need”). This fosters trust that the system is being managed honorably.
