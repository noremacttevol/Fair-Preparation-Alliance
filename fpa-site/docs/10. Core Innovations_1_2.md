- **Advanced Training Simulations (VR/AR):** Early concept stage: using Virtual or Augmented Reality to simulate disaster scenarios for training. E.g., VR could let a member “experience” a house fire escape or first aid situation interactively. _Need Feedback:_ Does this interest members? What scenarios would be most valuable to simulate safely? Do members have VR access or should we set up regional training rigs?

- **Regional Cache & Safehouse Network:** We plan to establish more physical caches of supplies and designated safehouses that members can access in crises. Some regions have ad-hoc ones; we want to formalize it. _Need Feedback:_ Input on locations (where are they most needed?), management (how to secure and maintain them?), and what inventory is priority (food, water, tools, medical). We also welcome donations or leads for facilities.
