1. **Open Test-My-Plan** and note any slice < 40 %.  
2. **Schedule one micro-drill** per low slice—start with the 15-minute _Realnet Radio Check_ tonight.  
3. **Log drills** during Friday’s Pulse Test; watch the slice grow.  
4. **Set a 30-day reminder** to rerun Test-My-Plan and track improvement (the wheel snapshot will auto-compare versions).
