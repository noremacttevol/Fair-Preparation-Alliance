- **Member Ranks and Roles:** Aligned with Readiness Cred, members may attain ranks or roles (e.g. _Auditor, Specialist, Gear Council Member, Squad Leader_) based on their activity and trust level. These ranks come with **responsibilities** in the gear process. For example, a member who is a certified _Gear Auditor_ might be called upon to lead a testing project for a complex item, ensuring the audit protocol is properly followed. A _Squad Leader_ might coordinate a multi-member test in their region. A _Gear Council_ (a committee of highly trusted members from different squads) might oversee final endorsement votes to ensure fairness. Ranks do **not** create hierarchy for its own sake, but they help organize who does what best. This way, every phase – from initial audit to AI review – has the right people involved, and newer members can apprentice under experienced ones.
