A. Fostering Honesty and Transparency  
Honesty is the lifeblood of trust. We actively cultivate an environment where truth is valued and transparency is the default. Concretely, this involves:  
Psychological Safety Practices: As mentioned, we train leaders to create a safe space for truth-telling. This includes encouraging questions and admitting uncertainty. Leadership regularly shares information about decisions and the state of the Alliance openly with members (financials, strategy, challenges) to model transparency. When mistakes happen, we acknowledge them publicly and analyze them without defensiveness. This norm travels downward: we want every member to feel it’s okay to say “I made a mistake” or “I disagree with this”. A hallmark of our culture will be that problems are reported or admitted quickly – “bad news early is good news” – enabling fast fixes. Teams are urged to adopt blameless post-mortems for projects, which reinforces that acknowledging issues leads to learning, not punishment.
