FPA’s overall strategy is structured into three phases, each representing a stage of development and action as situations escalate. This phased approach, outlined in the Mark I Mod III Framework ([[Mark I Mod III Framework (Current Plan)]]), allows the Alliance to grow and adapt systematically. Phase 1 is the current (pre-crisis) phase: focus is on organization and preparation during “normal” times.

Key elements of Phase 2 include deploying the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] – a dedicated comms network to maintain contact when mainstream channels fail – and ramping up coordinated support: members share resources more actively, rally at predetermined safe points ([[Rally Points and
