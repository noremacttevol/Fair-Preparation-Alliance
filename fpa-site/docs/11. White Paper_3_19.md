- **Keep training materials offline:** Download or print key reference sheets (FPA’s “quick first aid tips,” FEMA’s medical ops cheat-sheet, etc.) and include in your emergency binder. When an emergency happens, stress is high; having a reference to jog your memory is invaluable, especially for procedures you don’t do often. (Example: the CERT cribbing technique for lifting debris might be hard to recall cold – a diagram in your go-bag helps.)  
- **Update certifications as needed:** Mark your calendar for refreshers (CPR certs often expire in 2 years). Also, stay alert for advanced training opportunities: if a free weekend wilderness first aid course pops up and you have time, take it. Phase1 is about basics, but nothing stops you from exceeding the milestone.  
**Phase1.5: Establish personal emergency communications and backups (Outernet/Radio) for all members by Q2 2025.**
