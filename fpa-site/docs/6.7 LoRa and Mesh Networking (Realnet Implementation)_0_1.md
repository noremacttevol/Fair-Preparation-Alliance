sending dummy messages across town solely via these hops, refining the node placement when messages don’t get through. Power backup for each node is arranged (like battery or solar hats on the LoRa modules) so the network stays up through outages. A fully realized Realnet might allow someone in Chapter East to send a digital note to Chapter West without cell service – it hops through intermediate chapter nodes along the way. This is essentially creating a community intranet: you could post a “need help at X location” on a local server and others will see it and respond, or share files like PDFs of a repair manual to all connected nodes. LoRa in particular might carry short updates hundreds of kilometers if meshed well and with high antennas – connecting even spread-out rural members. Through hands-on building of these networks, FPA turns the abstract idea of a “backup internet” into a tangible reality, giving the group an independent digital nervous system that persists even when the outside signals die.
