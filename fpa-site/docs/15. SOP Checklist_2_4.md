6. **Get on the comms net (at least as a listener):** Communication is life in an emergency. The FPA expects every member to have at least one way to get information off-grid. Easiest: buy an FRS/GMRS walkie-talkie or a basic **HAM radio** receiver. Even if you’re not licensed to transmit yet, you can **listen** to the FPA’s emergency channel (your local chapter will tell you which frequency to monitor, often part of our “Outernet” radio network). Do a radio check with your squad – e.g. at a scheduled time, ensure you can hear them or they can hear you on the radio. If you have a HAM license already, great, start joining the weekly **Pulse Test** nets (radio check-ins) to practicefile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpagfile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. If not, consider this step your impetus to study for at least the entry-level HAM license (Technician in the US)file-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpagfile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. _Phase 1 reality:_ not everyone will transmit on HAM, but everyone **must** have a means to receive critical info. If you’re truly broke and can’t get a radio yet, coordinate with your squad – maybe you can be the designated runner to someone who has one. One way or another, get plugged into the communication loop beyond just cell phones.
