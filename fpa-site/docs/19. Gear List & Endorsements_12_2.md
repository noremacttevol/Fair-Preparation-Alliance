- _Results Documentation:_ Fill out a results section with observations from each test above. Use clear language and quantifiable data when possible (“after 50 pumps, filter flow rate was 1 liter/min”; “axe chopped through 4” log in 5 minutes”). If the item fails or underperforms in any area, describe how and hypothesize why if you can. Also highlight any area it exceeded expectations.  
- _Comparison & Alternatives:_ (Optional, but valuable) If testers have similar gear on hand, do side-by-side comparisons. “CampStove X boiled 1L of water in 8 min vs. 5 min for our endorsed RocketStove Y.” Note if the gear fills a unique niche or overlaps with others.  
- _Tester Info:_ Each person who tested should sign off with their name (or member ID), squad, date of testing, location of testing (city or environment type), and any relevant expertise (“Certified electrician”, “5 years bushcraft experience”, etc.). This helps contextualize results and lends credibility.  
- _Pass/Fail & Additional Comments:_ Though the final endorsement decision is collective, testers can provide a preliminary thumbs-up or down based on their experience. They can also list any recommended improvements for the manufacturer or tips for users (“wrap handle with tape for better grip”, “needs a better carrying case”, etc.).
