- **AI-Powered Guidance (With Human Oversight):** We introduce **AI assistants** into the app and command centers to help parse information and suggest actions. For example, an AI might analyze local weather, news, and member reports to flag emerging crises (natural disasters, civil unrest, supply shortages) and recommend pre-emptive measures. If a hurricane is forecast, the AI can cross-check member locations and suggest which squads should evacuate or fortify, and what resources are needed where. **However, every AI suggestion is just that – a suggestion.** Human coordinators (from squad leaders up to the national core team) review AI outputs through the lens of real-world judgment. We maintain **strict human oversight** on all AI-driven decisions to avoid blind trust in algorithms. Our motto: _“Trust, but verify – then decide.”_ The **AI Reliability & Human Oversight** protocols in our system require that no critical action goes through without a human green light. The AI serves to augment our intelligence, not replace it.
