- **In-App Squad Governance Tools:** The app provides squads with tools to manage themselves. **Squad chat** and event scheduling are a given by now. Beyond that, squads have their own mini-dashboards to track member participation, propose internal votes (e.g., vote someone to E-4 rank, or vote on accepting a new member who moved into town), and maintain their squad’s **readiness metrics**. There might be a **squad health meter** visible to its members, summarizing things like last drill date, average member readiness level, etc., so the squad can self-correct if engagement drops.  
- **Decentralized Rank Promotions:** By Phase3, promotions and demotions are largely handled within squads. A squad can vote to promote a member to the next rank once criteria are met ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=,audits%20and%20regional%20mentor%20logs/)). The system ensures no one can be promoted without meeting the objective requirements (logged tasks), but beyond that, it defers to the squad’s collective approval. Demotions or removals (e.g., for inactivity) also start with the squad. The **inactivity policy** is enforced: if a member has been inactive, the app flags it (ping at 30 days inactive, auto-flag at 60) and the **squad leader or council decides** whether to drop the member, mark them for mentoring, or merge them into another squad if their squad shrinks. This pushes decision-making to the edges while keeping everyone accountable.
