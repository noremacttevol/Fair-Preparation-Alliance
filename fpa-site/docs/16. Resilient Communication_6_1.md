Let’s unpack this contrast clearly:  
- **Tactical Waste (Isolation and Overemphasis on Firepower):** A prepper who hoards 10,000 rounds of ammo and a dozen guns but invests nothing in communication or community is combat-ready on paper but strategically crippled. They have brute force but no situational awareness beyond line of sight. If a crisis erupts, they can defend a pile of supplies, but they can’t call for help, can’t warn others of threats, can’t coordinate with neighbors to force-multiply defense, and can’t adjust to changing scenarios because they’re in an information blackout. All that ammunition might end up expended pointlessly or never fired at all while more subtle threats (disease, fire, lack of intel) bypass their defenses. **Tactical waste** is preparation that _looks_ impressive in inventory, but in practice, much of it could go to waste because there’s no doctrine to direct it. The “Rambo” fantasy ends badly when one injury or one missed warning brings down the lone wolf. The Alliance actively discourages this mindset. We would rather you have 100 bullets and a two-way radio than 10,000 and silence.
