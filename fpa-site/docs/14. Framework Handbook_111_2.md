- **Anti-Gouging & Demand Management:** The dynamic pricing logic also kicks in during crises. Unlike stores that might raise prices due to demand (or run empty shelves due to hoarding), FPA uses pricing to manage fairness. We often **freeze** prices at normal or discounted rates for critical goods when a disaster is looming (essentially an anti-gouging policy within FPA). If something is very scarce, we don’t auction to the highest bidder; instead, we might temporarily allocate via our points system or rationing. For example, if we have 10 generators and 30 families want one due to an incoming hurricane, the system will prioritize those in greatest need (medical necessity, no alternatives) and could allocate them at standard prices to those, while maybe asking others to wait or pay in more points (which are refunded or reallocated to relief efforts). The key is **transparency and trust**: members generally support this because they know it ensures the group’s resilience, not profit. And if you “give up” an item or pay extra in a crisis because you can manage without, the system recognizes that (perhaps giving you credit for future needs).
