- **ICS Training and Adoption:** Squads don’t need a full bureaucracy, but understanding ICS is crucial for working alongside professionals. Encourage multiple squad members to complete FEMA’s ICS courses ([Working with the Cajun Navy: Optimizing the use of volunteers in disaster response | NSF - National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/news/working-cajun-navy-optimizing-use-volunteers#:~:text=Communication%20between%20volunteers%20and%20formal,coordinated%20to%20help%20dispatch%20volunteers)). Internally, run your operations with a light ICS flavor during bigger drills – e.g., designate an Incident Lead, have someone handle communications (acting as an ICS “Operations” function) and someone to document and plan (ICS “Planning” function). This hands-on familiarity ensures that if you ever operate under a larger Incident Command, your team knows how to plug in. It also means your squad can scale up management if dealing with a big neighborhood incident independently. Use ICS forms (like ICS-214 unit logs or ICS-211 check-in lists) for practice; they’re available freely and can help organize chaos.
