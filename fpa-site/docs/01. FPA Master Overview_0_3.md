Communications Backbone: Phase1 establishes a robust low-tech communications backbone. The Alliance designates 7.200MHz (HAM radio) as our daily pulse frequency for check-ins and coordination. At scheduled times (e.g. a brief roll-call every evening), members broadcast a “pulse” – a short status update or even just a signal – on 7.200MHz LSB. This habit forms a reliable heartbeat for the Alliance: even if phones and internet fail, anyone with a shortwave radio can tune in to hear our presence and coordinate. We use any means necessary to stay linked – CB radio channels, in-person meetups, even courier – to ensure no member is isolated.  
Resource & Gear Standardization: We kick off the Alliance’s Approved Gear List and tiered equipment system. Gear is categorized in tiers so new members can prioritize essentials first. For example, Tier1 gear covers immediate survival basics (water filtration, first-aid kit, flashlight, fire starter, multi-tool, etc.). Tier2 adds extended survival items (long-term food storage, advanced medical supplies, HAM radio, backup power, etc.). Tier3 includes specialized equipment (solar generators, seed vaults, advanced tools, ballistic protection, etc.). By phasing gear this way, no one gets overwhelmed and every member quickly reaches a baseline of preparedness. Squad leaders conduct gear inspections and help members fill gaps. Nothing is left to chance – if it’s on the list, you secure it or your team finds a way to cover you.
