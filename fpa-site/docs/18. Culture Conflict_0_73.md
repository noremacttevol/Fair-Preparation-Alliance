Resilience Drills and Scenario Planning: To prepare for high-pressure situations, we sometimes simulate them. For example, we might hold a tabletop exercise: “Imagine a scenario where a founding member publicly accuses the leadership of betraying the mission – how would we respond as a community?” By discussing hypothetical tough cases, we improve our readiness for real ones. Similarly, just as organizations do fire drills, we can do “pause drills” – e.g., randomly ask a team in a low-stakes context to practice using the Pause Protocol and going through a quick mediation, so that when a real conflict arises, it’s not the first time they try the process. This builds muscle memory for resilience.
