The FPA App is essentially the digital hub for members. Key features include:  
- **Secure Messaging & Alerts:** Members can communicate via text or voice messages within their squad or chapter. Think of it as a secure group chat that can fall back to peer-to-peer mode when no internet is available (leveraging the mesh network from the previous chapter). Important alerts (weather warnings, evacuation orders, etc.) are distributed through the app as push notifications when online, or as stored messages relayed through other members when offline (e.g., one member goes to a location with signal and syncs updates, which then propagate via mesh to others).  
- **Resource Sharing & Tracking:** The app has a section for inventory and logistics. Squads can log their critical supplies (anonymously or aggregated, respecting privacy) – this helps identify shortages or surplus in the network. If your squad has extra chainsaws and another needs one after a storm, a simple lookup shows who can help. During an incident, members can request resources or help through the app (e.g., “Need a generator at 5th Street”); nearby squads get notified to respond.
