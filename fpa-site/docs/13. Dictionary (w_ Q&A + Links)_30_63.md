and handle a weapon safely, etc. Also, things like fishing kits in bug-out bags are common FPA tips. So the stance: positive as part of a skill set (the more self-reliant, the better), but realistic about it – it’s not a magic solution for everyone to just “live off the land,” especially not all at once. It works best if you’ve prepared to do it (knowledge, gear like traps or fishing lines, maybe garden seeds to effectively forage by growing). In summary, FPA endorses foraging and hunting for those prepared to do so, as a layer of resilience after you’ve exhausted easier options. [#Intermediate] [#Skills]
