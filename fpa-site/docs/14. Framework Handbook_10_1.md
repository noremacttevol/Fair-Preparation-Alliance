- **Openness & Transparency:** Wherever possible, information is shared openly within the alliance. Threat intelligence, resource status, and decisions are communicated clearly (while of course maintaining operational security on sensitive details). Transparency fosters trust—people fear less when they feel informed. Under Mk1Mod2, some decisions by group leads were made opaquely, which led to suspicion. Mk1Mod3 corrects that by encouraging leaders to explain the “why” behind plans.  
- **Dependability & Support:** Members commit to supporting one another. This ranges from small acts (like helping a teammate fix their radio) to major ones (sheltering another family if they evacuate). Knowing you can rely on your squad mates is the whole point of being in an alliance. The doctrine formalizes the expectation that we are each other’s safety net. “One team, one fight” is an unofficial motto capturing this sentiment.  
- **Fairness & Equity:** Echoing FPA’s broader ethos, the Trust Doctrine calls for fair treatment and resource sharing. No one should exploit a crisis for personal gain at others’ expense. For example, if a squad supply cache is low on some item, members won’t hoard what’s left – they’ll distribute it according to need, trusting that others would do the same. This principle underpins the dynamic pricing system as well; it’s about equity and communal well-being.
