Trust in FPA is not a feeling—it’s a system. We don’t blindly “believe in the good” of individuals. We verify. Every squad member, leader, and AI output is subject to a chain of checks, documented actions, and transparent reviews. Trust must:  
- **Survive blackouts** (continue working with no digital access)  
- **Scale with growth** (hold up with 5 people or 50,000)  
- **Repair after failure** (self-audit, fix, and continue under pressure)  
We treat trust like infrastructure: if it fails, everything collapses. So we build it to military-grade durability.
