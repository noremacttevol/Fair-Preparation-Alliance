In summary, **FPA incentivizes what matters**: a cache of food and “10,000 bullets” might make you personally feel secure, but it does nothing for the Alliance if you can’t coordinate or share. But if you set up a solar HAM station, you become an asset for everyone. We recognize and reward that transformation. This incentive system, aligned with our values, ensures that advancement in the Alliance is synonymous with genuine preparedness that benefits all.
