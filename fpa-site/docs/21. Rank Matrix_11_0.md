#### Tool-Based Progression Calibration  
FPA Elevation Levels (E1â€“E10) are not linear promotions, but calibrated transformations. Each rank is anchored in tool-based diagnostics that confirm alignment, capacity, and readiness:  
- [[TERM:OpCheck]]: Verifies situational fluency and role-specific action capacity before elevation.
- [[TERM:Skill Delta]]: Surfaces learning gaps and compression thresholds; delta closure is required before tier shift.
- [[TERM:Gear Pool]]: Acts as an unlock map; elevation expands the domain-specific kits and protocols available.
- [[TERM:Squad Wheel]]: Assesses inter-relational roles and team synchronicity, critical for E4+ movements.  
These tools are indexed at each tier to avoid premature ascension and prevent static promotion models.

| Level | Readiness Signal       | Skill Delta Role         | Gear Pool Access Pattern | Squad Wheel Expectation   |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| E1    | Initial OpCheck pass   | Entry delta                | Seed gear access           | Pair bond only             |
| E3    | Sustained diagnostics  | Multi-skill intro          | Tiered basics              | Light team interaction     |
| E5    | Tactical complexity    | Sub-domain convergence     | Mid-tier unlocks           | Core Squad rotation        |
