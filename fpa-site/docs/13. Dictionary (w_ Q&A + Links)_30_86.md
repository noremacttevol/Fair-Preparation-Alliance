A: FPA tackles supply chain vulnerabilities by encouraging stockpiles, substitutions, and local self-reliance. Members are advised to store critical supplies well ahead of time: fuel stabilized in cans, essential medications with rotation (talking to doctors for extra if possible, or using mail-order 90-day scripts). They push for having alternate fuel sources – like solar chargers, wood gasifiers, or manual tools – in case gasoline runs out. During a crisis, the alliance coordinates resource sharing: if one member has extra of something and another is short, they arrange a swap or delivery. For larger scale issues, FPA might activate relationships with suppliers they’ve built (maybe they know a local propane distributor or pharmacy willing to work with them for emergency allocations). They also teach production: like how to create simple medical remedies (herbal or improvised) if meds aren’t available, how to set up rain catchment and water purification if bottled water is gone, or community gardens to bypass a broken food supply chain. Communication is used to find out where supplies are still moving – one region might radio that fuel is coming into X town, so members from areas around might go there to fill up. Additionally, FPA might have pre-arranged caches of supplies stored outside main population centers, which they can retrieve when store shelves are empty. In long crises, they encourage rationing plans – preserving what you have. Another aspect is tools and
