As situations intensify from Phase 1 to Phase 3, the role and choice of gear can shift, and FPA plans for those transitions:  
- Phase 1 (Normal / Blue-Sky): Gear focus is on preparation and training. Members have access to all resources, so they might use power tools to fortify homes, drive supplies to caches, and utilize digital gear for planning. This is when heavy gear (like large solar generators, bulky reference books, etc.) is most available and useful. The priority is staging and readiness: e.g., keeping vehicles fueled, batteries topped off.  
- Phase 2 (Disrupted / Gray-Sky): Some infrastructure is down. Portable gear becomes crucial. Members break out intermediate solutions: generators for short-term power gaps, portable radios now on constantly, and more robust personal protective gear if danger is rising. They may start carrying their go-bags even within the home or vehicle as uncertainty grows. Gear that bridges gaps (like a camp stove for when the gas is off, or portable water containers to fetch water from elsewhere if taps dry up) comes into play.
