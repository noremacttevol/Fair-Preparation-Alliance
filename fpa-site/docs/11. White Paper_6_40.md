16. **Milestone 16: Cross-Train in Multiple Skills**  
- _Real-World Example:_ In one drill, the designated radio operator was away, and no one else knew how to properly use the HAM set to call for help. The squad learned from that embarrassment and instituted cross-training: now every member takes turns practicing with the radio, the first aid kit, the generator, and even leadership roles. A different squad had everyone rotate through a basic CERT role-play (fire suppression, cribbing for debris lifting, etc.). When an incident later occurred, a member confidently grabbed a fire extinguisher to put out a small fire while another set up the radio to relay information – tasks they only learned because they had swapped roles during training.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ Silos kill resilience. While individuals may have specialties, **everyone should have working knowledge of all critical tasks.** Decentralization in practice means the group isn’t crippled by one person’s absence or weakness. Cross-training also deepens respect – members appreciate each other’s roles more when they try them. **Lesson:** Rotate duties in low-stakes times to avoid rotation in high-stakes times by necessity. Versatility is a hallmark of a strong squad.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Make a list of core skills/equipment that only one or two members currently handle (e.g., operating the radio, using the chainsaw, administering EpiPen, map reading/navigation, incident command coordination).
