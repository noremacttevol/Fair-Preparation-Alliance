for consensus in councils, but we have fallback voting mechanisms (like supermajority votes) if consensus canâ€™t be reached in a timely manner. If a higher authority or communication line is ever unreachable in a crisis, our structure has fail-safes: circles will coordinate laterally or follow pre-agreed contingency plans rather than just halt. In short, **local autonomy handles the day-to-day, and council governance handles the big picture**, with clear handoffs between them. This way, we avoid chaos while also avoiding one group unnecessarily overriding another. (Escalation and quorum details are further guided by the _command hierarchy origin_ outlined in the [[Trust Doctrine]] and the readiness levels in our [[Operational Readiness Progression (ORP)]] model.)
