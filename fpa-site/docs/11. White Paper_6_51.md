- _Action Steps:_  
- Find out if your city/county has a VOAD or similar coordinating body. Emergency management offices or United Way chapters might know this. If it exists, attend their meetings (often open to community orgs). Present your squad’s presence and capabilities to the group.  
- Network within VOAD: identify organizations that have parallel goals (animal rescue, disability support, etc.) and exchange contacts. Your squad might serve as the local “feet on the ground” for such orgs in your area in return for their specialized expertise when needed.  
- If no formal coalition exists, consider initiating a simpler roundtable among local volunteer leaders: invite CERT team leaders from nearby, church disaster committee heads, etc., to a coffee chat about “how can we coordinate better when something happens?” This can informally create that network.  
- Leverage the Compass Guide and FPA Dictionary as tools to share: by showing other groups you have a structured plan (and even a glossary for terms), you build credibility and maybe inspire them to adopt some of FPA’s practices, easing future collaboration.  
- Use these networks to secure **redundancy**: maybe one neighboring community has a generator, another has a shelter space, and your squad has manpower. Agreements can be made that if one area is hit, others send help and vice versa. This way, local squads form a mesh of support across the region – an embodiment of decentralization with unity.
