Emotional Support: Members check on each other. The buddy system means everyone has at least one person to talk to. The group does not shame someone for breaking down or expressing fear – instead they listen and encourage. Sometimes just acknowledging “Yes, this is really hard” is enough to help someone regather themselves. In group settings, some may share feelings to ventilate – FPA might hold a quick evening talk where anyone can voice concerns (sort of like a campfire chat) moderated to keep it supportive.  
Use of Humor and Positivity: Appropriate humor is a powerful morale booster. FPA doesn’t forbid laughter – in fact, cracking a joke in a grim situation can relieve tension (as long as it’s not at someone’s expense or undermining seriousness). Some members naturally fill the role of morale officers – making light comments, celebrating small victories (like cheering when power comes back on, even if briefly). Celebrating birthdays or achievements even during crises can help; maybe someone rigged a solar charging station – the group gives them a hearty thanks and maybe a fun nickname.
