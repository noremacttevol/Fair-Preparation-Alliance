messaging means we try to stomp out rumors quickly by flooding the zone with verified facts. We also train our volunteers in basic crisis communication – essentially, every squad member should be a mini public information officer for their block. By decentralizing that role, it’s harder for an overall failure to occur; even if officials are silent, an FPA volunteer with a battery radio and a bullhorn can keep neighbors informed. Additionally, because we are community-rooted, people know us and _trust_ us (we aren’t some distant official they’ve never met). This grassroots trust is a shield against the kind of distrust seen in PR; people are more likely to heed a preparedness message from a neighbor they know worked on the community garden with them than a government voice that’s absent until disaster strikes.
