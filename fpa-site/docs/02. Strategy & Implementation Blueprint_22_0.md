We treat resilience as something to be maintained actively:  
- **Failure Mode Drills:** We simulate various failure modes regularly: server outages, AI giving wrong advice, corrupted data, leadership absence, etc. We ensure that _no_ aspect is assumed infallible. For instance, a drill might have a twist where mid-operation the squad leader “goes down” (simulated injury or absence) – the team must adapt with next in command. Or the AI might deliberately provide a flawed output to see if members will catch it and correct it rather than follow blindly. These exercises build reflexes to handle failures gracefully and to trust but verify our tools.  
- **Resilience Audits:** Apart from drills, we conduct periodic audits of our systems and preparedness. A team (or external observers, when possible) will review a squad or the whole org: Are backup comms in place and functional? Are members skilled in using them? Is data recovery tested? Did we update that satellite phone’s subscription? These audits, logged in transparency records, hold us accountable to our own standards. If any gaps are found, we schedule a fix (be it training, equipment purchase, or procedural change) and follow up.
