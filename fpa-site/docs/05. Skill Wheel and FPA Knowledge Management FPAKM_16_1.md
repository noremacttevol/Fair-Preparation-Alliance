- **Challenging Scenarios:** The AI’s survivability analysis can present new challenges to high performers. For example, a member who reaches 75% might start getting advanced scenario prompts from FPAi like, “You’re very solid – but could you handle _this_ extreme scenario?” This ensures that as someone improves, they are presented with increasingly tough hypotheticals, much like a coach upping the difficulty level. In essence, the system can “raise the bar” with scenario-based coaching so that nobody feels there are no further mountains to climb. It’s akin to how video games introduce harder levels as you master easier ones, preventing you from resting on your laurels.
