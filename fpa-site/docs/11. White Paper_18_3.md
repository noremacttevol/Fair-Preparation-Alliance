- Use technology to assist: if possible, set up a gateway that automatically does some bridging – e.g., a radio-to-text system that feeds urgent HAM messages into a server that Content Team sees, or a text-to-speech that could read Outernet text over a dedicated radio channel periodically. (Keep such automation simple to avoid bugs during crises.)  
- Regularly test the integrated flow: include in drills scenarios where one channel feeds the other. E.g., insert a dummy “SOS” via radio and see if it appears on Outernet, and push a dummy “Alert” via Outernet and verify it’s read on radio nets.
