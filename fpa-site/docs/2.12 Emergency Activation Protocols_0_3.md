New Info: As the situation evolves, the protocols adapt. E.g., if initial plan was to rally at Safehouse A but intel says route to A is blocked, the Communications Lead will relay “Alternate rally at Site B” as per backup plan. Members confirm receipt with simple acknowledgements. Because this could get chaotic, protocols emphasize concise, clear communication and confirmation. Secure the Network: Activation also means going into a higher security posture. The OPSEC guidelines from [[Operational Security (OPSEC) Measures]] intensify – communication might move to encrypted channels exclusively, unnecessary radio chatter is cut to reduce intercept risk, and members might use their predetermined “handle” instead of real names even among themselves, in case outsiders are listening during the chaos. Coordination with Neighbors: The protocols may also include guidance on linking with friendly neighbors or community once core FPA coordination is done. For example, after the FPA group is set, they might offer help to immediate neighbors (which can also secure the neighborhood and thus FPA’s environment). But this is done carefully and after internal stability is ensured. Deactivation or Transition: The activation stays in effect as long as needed. If it turns out to be a false alarm or the situation resolves (e.g., hurricane veered away), leadership will send a stand-down message (e.g., “ALL CLEAR – Resume Phase 1 mode, stay prepared”).
