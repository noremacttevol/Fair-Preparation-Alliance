Exit with Dignity (if needed): In cases where despite our best efforts, it’s clear that someone is not a fit for the Alliance’s culture (e.g., repeated harassment, or consistently toxic behavior), part of conflict handling is to manage their exit in a way that minimizes drama and respects their dignity as a person. The decision might be made that it’s healthiest for all that the individual parts ways with FPA. We would handle this per Governance SOPs (due process, necessary approvals). But culturally, we aim to do it in a humane way – clearly communicating the reasons, allowing them to say their side, perhaps mutually agreeing on a resignation rather than a public firing, if circumstances allow. The rest of the Alliance would be given an explanation that maintains trust in the process (e.g., “We have agreed to part ways with X after multiple issues that couldn’t be resolved. We wish them well and will learn from this experience.”). This prevents ugly fights or people rallying into factions because someone was kicked out unfairly or harshly. Essentially, even when remedy fails, we handle separation with fairness and care, as an example of our values.
