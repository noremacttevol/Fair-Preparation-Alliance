- _Growing Squad Count:_ Use the mentorship model (Milestone 27) to seed new squads in adjacent areas. Aim for a **doubling strategy** – if you’re the first squad in town, try to facilitate two more squads within a year. If there are three, aim for six, and so on. This geometric growth acknowledges that disasters often affect whole regions; the more squads, the more coverage. Plan a scalable structure: perhaps form a citywide council of squad reps (this foreshadows Phase 3’s network). This council can share resources (a larger regional cache) and coordinate training events (scaling efficiency). Set milestone targets like “By Q4, recruit and train at least 5 members who will start Squad B in neighborhood X” and track progress. Onboarding automation can help – e.g., create a standard “Startup Pack” (checklists, flyer templates, our lessons learned) for new squad leaders to use, making replication easier.
