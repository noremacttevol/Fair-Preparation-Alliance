- **Local Servers & Mesh Networks:** In community hubs or overlapping squad areas, FPA can deploy local mini-servers or mesh network nodes. These devices (which could be as simple as a ruggedized Raspberry Pi with a Wi-Fi antenna) host a local copy of FPA data and act as a relay for the app. They enable a neighborhood of members to sync and message each other without internet, forming a local “intranet” for FPA activity. Mesh networking principles allow messages to hop device-to-device until reaching the destination or a gateway. This extends our offline-first principle to a community scale, not just individual.  
- **SHTF Stack:** The **SHTF stack** refers to the collection of tools and supplies each squad (and often each member) keeps for worst-case scenarios (“When **S**h**i**t **H**its **T**he **F**an”). This stack is layered on top of the technology but often consists of **low-tech or no-tech backups**. Examples of SHTF stack components:  
- Physical **maps and compass** for navigation if digital maps are inaccessible.  
- **Paper copies** of key SOPs or phone numbers in case devices die. (Every squad leader has a printed mini-Compass Guide for critical procedures.)  
- **First aid kits** and medical supplies that are proven to work in field conditions.  
- **Multi-tools and repair kits** to fix gear on the fly.  
- **Water purification**, food rations, and shelter basics for survival situations.
