These principles form our common ethical framework. They’re not just words on paper – you’ll see them in action. For example, **fairness** drives our unique membership fee system (everyone pays a small share and that share drops as more join – more on that below). **Teamwork** is why we form squads and require participation in group drills. **Continuous improvement** underpins our training programs and the **Alliance Points** system that rewards active members. Whenever tough decisions come up – say, whether to share supplies with an outside family, or how to handle a negligent member – we refer back to these core values. By adhering to them, we maintain unity and purpose, especially in crisis moments when it would be easy to panic or turn selfish.
