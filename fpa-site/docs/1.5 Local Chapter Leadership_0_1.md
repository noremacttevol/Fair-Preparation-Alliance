decisions during emergencies specific to their area (for example, where to establish a rally point or how to respond to a local flood), while staying in communication with regional/national leaders when possible. Succession planning is encouraged even at the local level (the chapter should have a deputy or plan if the primary lead is unavailable – see [[Continuity of Leadership]]). Local leaders are also charged with mentoring newer members and maintaining group cohesion, closely following principles from the national [[Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)]]. In summary, effective local leadership ensures that each community of FPA operates smoothly day-to-day and is ready to act cohesively when crises hit, while upholding FPA’s values on the personal scale. (Cross-ref: [[Mentorship and Peer Support]], [[Member Meetings and Events]] for local engagement methods.)
