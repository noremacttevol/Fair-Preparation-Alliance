- Pot with Lid: Cook food, boil water, sanitize instruments, carry water, use lid as plate, dig if needed, even use as noise-maker to signal.  
- Smartphones (with downloaded resources): In normal times, a phone is a tool for communication, navigation (GPS), information (PDF manuals, offline maps), light (flashlight app), and documentation (camera). FPA encourages maximizing the utility of devices by storing data and apps that work offline.  
- Bungee Cords & Zip Ties: Temporary fixers for gear and infrastructure – from bundling firewood to securing a splinted limb, their uses are myriad.
By packing and highlighting these multipurpose items, the Alliance ensures each piece of gear in a kit pulls its weight in several ways. It’s a very resource-efficient mindset: when a new gadget is considered, they ask “can something we already carry do this job?” Often the answer is yes with a bit of creativity, and that creative approach is constantly cultivated among members.
