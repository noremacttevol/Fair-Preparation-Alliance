For example, a Phase 2 trigger might be a “Black Sky Event” (total grid failure) or declaration of martial law – events that indicate it’s time to activate the Realnet and emergency plans. The strategy also allows moving back if things stabilize (though generally once progressed, they assume a new normal). This multi-phase plan ensures FPA doesn’t prematurely expose itself (staying mostly covert in Phase 1) but is ready to act decisively when needed. Each member is briefed on the overall plan in broad strokes during [[Onboarding New Members]] so they know the big picture: prepare now quietly, stand ready to activate our network in a crisis, and aim to help rebuild a fair, prepared society afterward. This shared strategic vision aligns all activities under a common roadmap. (Detailed breakdowns: see [[Phase 1: Early Organization & Preparedness]], [[Phase 2: Network Expansion & Communications]], and [[Phase 3: Outreach & Community Resilience]] notes for specifics of each phase.)
