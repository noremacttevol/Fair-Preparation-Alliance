Cascading crises often take down the very infrastructures we rely on – power grids go dark, cell towers and internet service falter, supply chains stall. FPA’s Mk1Mod3 addresses this head-on with an **Offline-First Infrastructure Blueprint**, a plan to build and maintain systems that do not depend on external power or the internet. The principle is simple: _assume_ that during a disaster, you’ll have no connectivity and limited electricity, and plan accordingly. If those services remain up, great – but if not, you have a fallback.
