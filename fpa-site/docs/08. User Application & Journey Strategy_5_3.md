- **Rank and Progression = Cultural buy-in:** The FPA rank system (E-1 through higher tiers) is more than gamification; it’s a scaffold for culture. New users learn that to advance (earn trust and status), they must engage in the _behaviors the culture values_ – sharing gear tips, showing up to drills, helping squadmates ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=,squad%20votes,%20regional%20mentoring/)). This creates a **positive feedback loop**: the most active, helpful members rise in rank and naturally take on mentorship roles, exemplifying the desired attitude to newer folks. The **Pulse Points (Readiness Cred)** concept, if implemented, further cements this. It acts as a quasi-currency of trust: you gain points by contributing (hosting a radio session, spotting an error in content, assisting others), and you can “spend” them for privileges (like hosting larger events or requesting advanced training). Though optional, this idea reinforces that _influence is earned by trustworthiness and service_, aligning incentives with culture. By Phase3, even if formal Pulse Points aren’t adopted, the spirit is there in how veteran members’ voices carry weight due to their proven track record.
