1. **Bubble Limits on Offline‑First** — service‑worker caching tested only on Chrome; need Firefox & iOS PWA validation.  
2. **Supabase Sync Complexity** — two sources of truth (Bubble & Supabase) can diverge; must schedule hydration script.  
3. **Print‑Pipeline File Size** — PDF converter occasionally outputs >3MB; need compression step.  
4. **Trust‑Ledger Performance** — Bubble Repeating‑Group may lag at >5k rows; consider external render via Supabase + iframe.  
5. **Audit‑Log Transparency** — UI design pending; raw logs readable but UX not mapped.  
_Action Next:_ prototype #1–2 fixes in Dev branch, demo in weekly WG call.
