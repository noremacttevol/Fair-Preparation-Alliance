- **Transparent & Trustworthy:** Honesty is paramount. According to our **Trust Doctrine**, credibility is earned by transparency and consistency. We openly share what we know _and_ what we don’t. If a situation is uncertain or evolving, we say so, and we update frequently. This principle stems from hard lessons: e.g., after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, poor communication and mishandling of information gaps led to rampant rumors and **diminished public trust** ([Communication Failures Led to Confusion, Rumors and Widespread Public Distrust after Hurricane Maria’s Devastation of Puerto Rico | Milken Institute School of Public Health | The George Washington University](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/communication-failures-led-confusion-rumors-and-widespread-public-distrust-after-hurricane-marias#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20DC%20,death%20toll%20from%20Hurricane%20Maria)). FPA will not repeat those mistakes – our communications will acknowledge gaps and strive to fill them with verified info as soon as possible. We also cite sources or reasoning for our directives when appropriate, so our audience understands _why_ we ask them to do something. This openness helps people trust that we aren’t hiding inconvenient truths.
