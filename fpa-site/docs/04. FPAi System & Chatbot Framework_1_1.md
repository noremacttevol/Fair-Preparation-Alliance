- **Personal Plan Evaluation (“Test My Plan”):** FPAi includes a tool called **Test My Plan** that lets you analyze your emergency preparedness plan using AI. You input details of your plan (scenarios, supplies, family info, evacuation routes, etc.), and the AI checks it against FPA’s expert criteria ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=2.xn--%20,if%20scenarios%20and%20find%20gaps-dx1x/)). It will simulate “what-if” scenarios to find any gaps or weaknesses. Then it gives you a **feedback report** highlighting strengths and weaknesses in your plan, with specific suggestions for improvement ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=3.%20,overall%20preparedness%20score%20or%20rating/)). For example, it might flag if your water supply is insufficient or if you lack a backup communication method, and it will suggest exactly what to do (e.g. store a certain number of gallons, get a HAM radio, etc.) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=3.%20,overall%20preparedness%20score%20or%20rating/)). It even provides an overall preparedness score or rating so you know where you stand ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=3.%20,overall%20preparedness%20score%20or%20rating/)). After making improvements, you can re-run the test to see your score improve
