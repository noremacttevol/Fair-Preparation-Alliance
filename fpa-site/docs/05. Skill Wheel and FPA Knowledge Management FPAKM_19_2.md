By the end of Phase1, we expect to have all active members set up with an **initial Skill Wheel profile** (most likely documented by their squad leaders or instructors), and a general understanding throughout FPA of what the Skill Wheel is and why we’re using it. We’ll likely also have created some supporting documentation – for example, a section in the SHTF Bible or a pamphlet explaining how the system works, and entries in the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]] defining new terms introduced by the system. Success for Phase1 is measured by acceptance and understanding: members should feel the wheel reflects them reasonably well, and leadership should have confidence that the concept is sound for scaling up.
