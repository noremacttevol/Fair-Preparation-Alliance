**Action Steps:**  
- **Secure water supply (2 weeks/person):** Store at least 14 gallons _per person_ (1 gal per day for drinking and minimal sanitation). This can be as simple as cleaned repurposed soda bottles filled with tap water (practically free). If you have space, consider a 55-gallon drum (~~$80) or a couple of the 7-gallon BPA-free jugs (~~$15 each). _Low-cost option:_ If money is tight, focus on water purification: acquire unscented bleach or water purification tablets (just a few dollars) and know how to use them. And don’t forget a cheap water filter (even a $20 Sawyer Mini) to refill from natural sources if available. Mark your calendar to rotate stored water every 6-12 months (set a phone reminder or sticker on the container).  
- **Stockpile non-perishable food (2 weeks/person):** Aim for at least 1,500–2,000 calories per person per day. Prioritize foods that don’t require refrigeration or much cooking: rice, beans, pasta, canned vegetables and meats, peanut butter, oats, etc. _Budget tip:_ You can achieve this gradually – each supermarket visit, grab a couple of extra canned goods or a bag of rice. Dollar stores can be surprisingly good for canned food deals. Store what you eat and eat what you store: cycle through these in daily use to keep it fresh. Ensure you have a manual can opener (cost ~$5) accessible.
