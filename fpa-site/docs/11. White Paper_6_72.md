- Coordinate with FPA central if possible: send them your site/social link to be listed in any FPA directory. This also means you might get content to share (FPA might provide graphics, updates, etc., which you can repost). Cross-link to the FPA Dictionary or Compass Guide for definitions or detailed topics so interested readers can dive deeper.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If no one on the team is tech-savvy, reach out to a local high school or community college – a student might be happy to volunteer to set up a basic page as a project. Alternatively, ask FPA HQ (if such exists) for help; they might have templates. If internet access is very limited in your community (rural or economically limited), prioritize traditional outreach (flyers, town hall meetings) and maybe maintain just a minimal email subscription list for those who do have connectivity. Also be cautious to not divulge sensitive info online: no personal addresses or full names without consent, no listing of exact equipment stockpiles – keep messaging general yet informative.
