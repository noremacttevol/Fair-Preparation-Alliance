Open Information Flows: We minimize secrecy. Meeting notes from Circle Councils are made available to all circle members, and key points from Movement Council meetings are shared Alliance-wide (except confidential personnel matters). Tools like collaborative platforms or dashboards are used so everyone can see what other teams are working on, reducing suspicion or ignorance that can breed conflict. If someone has a concern that perhaps a team isn’t following guidelines, they likely can see the team’s work transparently or approach them directly rather than harboring suspicions. This openness heads off many conflicts born of misinformation.
