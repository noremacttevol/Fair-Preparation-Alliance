**Action Steps:**  
- **Establish contact with your mentor/mentee:** If you’re new to FPA (joined in Phase1), request a mentor through the FPA app or local chapter. If you’re an experienced member (say you’ve completed most Phase1 milestones already), volunteer to mentor someone less experienced. We will try to pair folks within similar time zones or regions when possible. Once paired, introduce yourselves via a call or meeting. Exchange non-internet contact info (phone numbers, radio call signs) in case the grid’s down and you need to reach each other.  
- **Set mutual goals and schedule check-ins:** The mentor and mentee should agree on a few milestones to hit in a given timeframe – often these will align with Phase1 tasks. For example: “By next month, let’s get your 72-hour kit together and do a short power-out drill.” Schedule regular check-ins (maybe 30 minutes weekly or biweekly). Put it on the calendar and stick to it as much as possible. Treat it like a serious appointment. If life gets in the way, reschedule promptly. Consistency builds momentum.
