aligns with their mission. They also forecast societal changes: for instance, how climate change might introduce new emergencies and what innovations will be needed to cope (e.g., better wildfire monitoring sensors, or resilient cooling systems during heatwaves). In the vault, there’s a “horizon scanning” note that gets periodically updated with news on these cutting-edge topics. By preparing for possible futures, the Alliance tries to be ahead of the curve – so that when a new tech matures, they’re ready to integrate it, and if a new challenge arises, they’ve perhaps already scouted a tool or method to meet it. This forward-looking stance ensures FPA remains at the innovative forefront of preparedness, continuously evolving its practices not just from lessons of the past but also from the promises of the future.
