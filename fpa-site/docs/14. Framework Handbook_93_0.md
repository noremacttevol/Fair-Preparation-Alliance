One challenge is that not everyone is tech-savvy or can afford fancy equipment. The Offline-First Infrastructure Blueprint is tiered (much like gear tiers in Chapter 10):  
- **Basic tier:** At minimum, every member should have a battery radio (even a $30 FRS/GMRS walkie-talkie and a set of spare batteries) and a solar phone charger. The blueprint provides a shopping list of low-cost items that hugely increase resilience, and FPA’s dynamic pricing can subsidize these for those who need help.  
- **Intermediate tier:** Squads invest in better comms (ham radios, license training, better solar setups). Many elements here are shared – not everyone needs an HF radio, but the squad ensures at least one or two have it. FPA facilitates group-buys to lower costs.  
- **Advanced tier:** Chapters establish more permanent installations: e.g., a radio repeater on a hilltop to extend range for all squads in the area, or a community solar charging station. This might involve fundraising or partnerships (some chapters got local businesses to donate towards a community generator). The blueprint guides how to liaise for such support.  
The idea is to scale based on resources: even if only basic tier is achieved, it’s far better than nothing (you at least have some comms and power for essentials). At full realization, an FPA-equipped community could almost operate its own independent micro-utility and communication service in an emergency, bridging the gap until normal services are restored.
