Communications readiness isn’t innate – it’s built through training and experience. The FPA’s Operational Readiness Progression (ORP) is the phased roadmap by which members advance from basic preparedness to advanced leadership. At each phase of ORP, specific communication and coordination competencies are required. This ensures that as one’s rank or role in the Alliance grows, so does one’s skill in keeping the team connected and informed. Below we outline training requirements and expectations for comms and related skills at each major phase of ORP:  
**Phase 1 – Individual Preparedness (ORP I: Apprentice):** This is where every new member begins. The focus here is on **personal communications capability and basic protocols**. A Phase 1 member must demonstrate the ability to operate simple communication devices like FRS/GMRS radios and understand Alliance basic signals/codes. Training includes:  
- **Radio Basics:** Learning how to power on/charge a handheld radio, how to change channels/frequencies, adjust volume/squelch, and transmit clearly. They practice by checking in to local FRS/GMRS practice nets (organized by the chapter weekly). They also learn voice procedure – brevity, clarity, using call signs or identifiers, and the phonetic alphabet for spelling critical info (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie...).
