- **Amendment Process Trial:** We are currently piloting a new **amendment submission system** where members can suggest changes or additions to this doctrine via a structured form. Instead of waiting for annual meetings, this online system collects proposals year-round, and if they gain enough support (e.g., X number of upvotes or endorsements from high-cred members), they trigger a formal review and vote. This is to keep our doctrine lively and responsive. The trial will run for one year to see if it effectively crowdsources improvements or if it leads to too much churn. (Experimental governance process.)  
Each of these initiatives will be clearly labeled and communicated as experimental. They are not to be confused with the core policies described in earlier sections of this doctrine. If and when an experiment proves successful and aligns with our principles, it will be brought forth in a general membership vote to be incorporated into the official doctrine (with a proper amendment and ratification). Until then, we proceed with innovation but also caution. The Alliance’s strength is in its principles, and no innovation is worth pursuing if it undermines what we stand for. Thus far, the membership has been enthusiastic about these experiments as ways to strengthen our community and impact, but final judgment rests on evidence – as with everything we do.
