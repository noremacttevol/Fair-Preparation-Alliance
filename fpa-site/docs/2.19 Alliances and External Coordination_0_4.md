about alliances with heavy government oversight – they wouldn’t, for example, register their members on a government list in exchange for some help; the alliance stops short of exposing themselves completely. Essentially, FPA engages in alliances that enhance survival and community welfare, but always with an eye to safeguarding the alliance’s own integrity and continuity. By coordinating externally where prudent, FPA multiplies its effectiveness and helps ensure that the wider environment in which they operate is as favorable as possible. This is the outward-looking aspect of their strategy – not just surviving in a bubble, but contributing to and shaping the survival ecosystem around them. (Cross-ref: [[External Partnerships and Outreach Policy]] in Governance for the principles guiding these external relations, and [[Public Image and Perception Management]] since positive alliances can improve how others view FPA.)
