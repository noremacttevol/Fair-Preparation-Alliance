A: FPA considers safe houses or hideouts as part of worst-case contingency planning. Not every member will have a dedicated hideout, but the alliance encourages thinking about where one could go if home isn’t safe and normal bug-out locations are compromised. A safe house could be a fellow member’s home in a safer area, a pre-arranged remote cabin, or even a network of places members could hop between. FPA fosters regional connections so that, for instance, if city members need to flee, rural members might host them (within capacity and trust). Planning involves identifying these locations well in advance, ensuring they’re stocked with some supplies (or the incoming person brings what’s needed), and establishing secretive travel routes to get there if security is an issue. The alliance probably has guidance on cache placement en route – maybe burying sealed buckets of food/fuel at secret locations on the way to a hideout, known only to that group. Safe houses within urban environments might also be considered: perhaps a hardened room in a building or a friend’s place that’s less likely to be targeted. OPSEC is huge here: knowledge of these hideouts is closely held, shared only with those who need to know (buddy teams, cell leaders). FPA might have signals or passwords for approaching a safe house (so the host knows it’s friend not foe). They also train on living low-profile if you’re in someone else’s area – contributing labor, not drawing attention. Some FPA documents may
