While the SHTF Bible is developed by FPA for its members, one of our values is to help the wider community. So we make much of the content (except maybe certain sensitive security details) publicly accessible. This way, even non-members can benefit from vetted preparedness information. It serves as a goodwill gesture and a practical tool to raise general preparedness out there – which in turn can reduce burdens during a crisis.  
In summary, the SHTF Bible is our **collective wisdom encoded in print and pixels**. It embodies the saying “knowledge is power” – especially when you have no one else to turn to. By arming every member with this knowledge, FPA ensures that even in the direst situations, guidance is at hand. It’s one more way Mk1Mod3 makes real readiness achievable, bridging the gap between knowing and doing when it matters most.
