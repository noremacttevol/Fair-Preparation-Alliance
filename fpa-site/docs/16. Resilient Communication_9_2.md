code means, rather than actual falsehoods. For example, if we say “Package is delivered” as a code for something, all Alliance members know what that signifies, we are not literally trying to trick them. Trust Doctrine also calls for transparency when safe – after an incident, leadership uses comms to explain decisions to the community, maintaining trust. If a hard call was made (e.g., relocating a group), an honest rationale is broadcast when appropriate so members aren’t left in the dark. In essence, our comms doctrine _operationalizes trust_: we build systems to authenticate users (so we know a voice is who they claim), we verify intel (so we trust the message content), and we ensure open, honest lines so that members trust the organization even under stress.
