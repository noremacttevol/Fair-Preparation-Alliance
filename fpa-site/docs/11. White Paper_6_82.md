- _Action Steps:_  
- Identify nearby areas that lack a squad. Perhaps a neighboring district or a specific community (like a trailer park, a high-rise building, or a village 10 miles away). Ideally, find at least one contact or interested person there to be the seed.  
- Reach out and offer to present what your squad has done. This could be a simple presentation at their local town hall or a coffee chat with a few key community members. Share materials: your milestone list, lessons learned, even equipment recommendations. Having the FPA Dictionary and Compass Guide at hand can lend weight (“this isn’t just us, it’s part of a bigger movement with resources”).  
- Propose a mentorship relationship: you’ll help them get started (maybe attend their first drill as evaluators, or invite them to observe yours), and be available for questions. Emphasize they remain autonomous – they pick what suits their community best. You’re just a friendly advisor.  
- If feasible, do a joint activity to kickstart them: e.g., a combined training session or joint fundraiser with proceeds split to fund a cache for the new squad. This both trains them and bonds the teams.
