To illustrate, consider a potential fragmentation scenario: perhaps a philosophical rift emerges, with some members wanting to shift FPA’s strategy in a new direction and others staunchly opposed. In a poorly governed group, this could lead to a split into two organizations. But in FPA, our framework would kick in: movement-level reflection forums would be convened to debate the issue thoroughly, each side would be heard, maybe experiments or compromises would be tried, a resolution process (possibly a vote or consensus) would be undertaken with the help of mediators to find common ground. Throughout, both sides engage knowing that the process is fair and their shared values ultimately align. Even if one side “loses” the argument, they’ve been part of a fair process and likely got some concessions; they remain in the Alliance because the mission and camaraderie are worth it. The Alliance thus stays intact, perhaps adjusting course slightly to integrate the best of both perspectives.  
In summary, by weaving together early intervention, clear processes, cultural norms, and accountability, the FPA has constructed a strong fabric that rips with great difficulty. Conflicts, which are natural strains on the fabric, instead of tearing it, actually strengthen the weave as we mend them diligently (much like muscle fibers growing stronger after being stressed). Fragmentation is avoided not by suppressing conflict, but by skillfully managing it and learning from it.
