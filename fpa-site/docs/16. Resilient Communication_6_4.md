In FPA training, whenever someone brags about massive stockpiles or a new weapon, instructors will often ask: _“That’s great, but who will you coordinate with and how?”_ It’s a polite way of re-focusing on the bigger picture. We don’t dismiss the need for defense – security is crucial – but **defense without coordination is just delay, not survival**. A cache of supplies can be lost in a fire or a raid; knowledge and networks, however, can rebuild and adapt. Communications readiness is every bit as essential as marksmanship or stockpiling. We engrain this by conducting drills where groups with less equipment consistently outperform individuals with more, purely because of teamwork and comms. The results convert even the skeptics.  
To avoid tactical waste, the doctrine prescribes that for every investment in “beans or bullets,” make a parallel investment in “bandwidth” (comms) and “brains” (training/plans). If you buy a new rifle, also buy a better antenna for your radio or spend time setting up a phone tree (radio tree) with neighbors. If you stored a year of food, also ensure you have means to communicate with a local farmer or supply source to replenish after a year – otherwise you’re just delaying starvation. The **Alliance Compass SOPs** emphasize balance: navigation, communication, security, and sustainability in equal measures. We apply those to procurement and planning.
