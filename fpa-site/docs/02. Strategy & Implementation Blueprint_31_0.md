Just as software gets updates, our organization gets “patches” and version upgrades:  
- **Scheduled Reviews:** We schedule regular intervals to review and update our core documents and systems. For example, minor updates (patches) to SOPs or the app might be reviewed quarterly, while major overhauls of the Blueprint might be considered yearly or as needed. This cadence ensures updates happen consistently but also allows time for changes to be implemented and evaluated before more changes.  
- **Version Control:** We treat this Blueprint like a versioned document. Mk1Mod3 is the current version; eventually we might issue Mk1Mod4, or Mk2 if we consider changes big enough to increment the major version. All versions are archived for reference. If someone wants to see how our strategy evolved, they can examine older versions. This is useful for transparency and for learning (sometimes ideas removed in the past might become relevant again, and we can revisit them rather than reinvent from scratch).
