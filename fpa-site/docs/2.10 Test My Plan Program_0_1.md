actually doing a fire drill with their household), grabbing their go-bag, and executing their evacuation route to their designated safe spot (like a neighbor’s yard or a specific street corner). Reviewers might observe discreetly or accompany (if safety allows) to time how long it took and note any difficulties (car wouldn’t start promptly, a pet was hard to gather, etc.). In cases where actual movement isn’t practical (say the plan is for a pandemic lockdown), the test may be table-top: the member describes step by step what they would do, and reviewers challenge them with “what if” injects (e.g., “what if cell networks are down, how do you contact relatives?”). Feedback and Iteration: After the test, the reviewers sit down with the member and discuss. They might ask: Did you remember to take all important items (check against what the member said was in their plan)? How did children react? Was the chosen meetup spot reachable in the expected time? Was any critical step missed (like forgetting to shut off utilities)? Often, reviewers, drawing from their own experience or FPA guidelines, will suggest improvements: maybe the member realized they hadn’t accounted for bad weather during evacuation, or their go-bag was too heavy to carry quickly. Those points are noted. The member then updates their plan accordingly – perhaps splitting items into a lighter “grab-first” bag and secondary bin, or choosing an alternate route that avoids a now-noticed choke point. The plan can be
