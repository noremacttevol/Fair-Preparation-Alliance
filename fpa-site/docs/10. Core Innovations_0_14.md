**What’s already implemented (current wins):** The Approved Gear List page is live with an initial set of categories: Water, Food Storage, Power, Medical, Comms, and Tools. **75+ products** are listed with FPA endorsements. Wins to date: we secured **group discounts** with three vendors (e.g., 20% off a recommended water filter brand for FPA members). Our field teams conducted hands-on testing of critical items – for instance, 10 different portable solar chargers were tested under cloud, shade, and stress conditions, and the top 2 models are now on the list with detailed **FPA Testing Notes**. This has already prevented members from buying subpar gear; a recent survey shows 90% of respondents found the list saved them time or money in choosing equipment. Additionally, the **community aspect** is shining – members who own listed items have left dozens of reviews with real-world insights (like how a certain first-aid kit held up in the field). This dynamic feedback loop ensures the list isn’t just static endorsements but a **living consumer report** for preppers. The list also ties into our Merit system – contributors who thoroughly review gear earn points, incentivizing ongoing updates.
