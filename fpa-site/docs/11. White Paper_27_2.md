- Draft a protocol document: how a proposal for merge/split is initiated (usually by the squads themselves or suggestion from a regional lead), how it’s discussed (joint meetings, mediated by a neutral if needed), and how it’s ratified (ideally by consensus or a vote of the members involved). Emphasize that no one is being “fired” – it’s about efficiency and better coverage.  
- Assign regional coordinators to monitor squad health indicators via the registry and personal check-ins. If they notice persistent low numbers or overlarge squads, they can gently prompt those squads to consider the protocol, offering facilitation.  
- Provide mediation support: perhaps an experienced squad leader from another area (or council member) can sit in on merger discussions to help align things, ensuring smaller personalities aren’t drowned out by bigger ones.  
- Logistics of merging: decide how to consolidate resources (radios, caches, any funds) fairly. Likewise, splitting: determine a fair division of gear and assign new call signs or IDs for the new squads. Write these into the guidelines so it’s not ad hoc each time.  
- Update the squad registry promptly when a change happens and broadcast the update to the network (so everyone knows “East Phoenix Squad” is now three separate squads with new names, etc., to avoid confusion in a crisis).
