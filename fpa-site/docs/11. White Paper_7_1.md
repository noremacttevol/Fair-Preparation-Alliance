- **Liaison Roles:** Each squad should assign a **Liaison Officer** (or point-person) for external coordination. In ICS terms, this mirrors the Command Staff position that connects incident commanders to cooperating agencies ([[PDF] INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM ICS POSITION: LIAISON OFFICER](http://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/f5559dd86dbe4a56dde8a871dcc9e775.pdf#:~:text=THE%20LIAISON%20OFFICER%27S%20FUNCTION%20IS,FROM%20ASSISTING%20AND%20COOPERATING%20AGENCIES)). The squad Liaison’s job is to communicate with government or relief agencies before and during an incident. For instance, if the city opens an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in a disaster, the squad Liaison will check in (in person or via radio) to relay the squad’s status and receive assignments or information. They act as the single voice to avoid confusion. Importantly, train this Liaison in basic ICS (IS-100 and IS-200 courses) so they know how to “speak ICS” and slot into official structures smoothly. A backup Liaison should be identified as well.
