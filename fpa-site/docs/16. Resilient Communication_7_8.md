- **Advanced Fallback Drills:** While Phase 2 introduced PACE, Phase 3 **masters** it. They develop comprehensive comms plans for different scenarios and run drills where multiple layers fail. For instance, a scenario could be: “Grid down due to EMP, primary and alternate comms down, initiate contingency plan: use car mobile radios (shielded spares) as improvised base stations, if that fails, send runners to predefined points.” Phase 3 training might involve coordinating actual courier runs. One exercise we use is a **“Comms Collapse Drill”**: simulate that all radios died – Phase 3 trainees must direct teams to use non-electronic signals (like signal fires, whistles, or physical runners) to pass a simple message across several kilometers. It’s a test of both planning and leadership to organize such primitive comms under stress.
