Cyber and Information Warfare: In an era of cyber threats, a network like FPA could be a target for disruption by malicious actors (including hostile nations during a conflict, or hackers for mischief). An attacker could try to sabotage FPA’s communications or spread disinformation during a crisis to cause chaos. This is not far-fetched – there have been instances of false information spread during disasters to mislead people. FPA must treat information security as a priority: verifying sources, using secure channels for critical alerts, and educating members to avoid rumor-mongering. A concerted disinformation campaign (for example, fake messages that “FPA says everyone in City X should evacuate due to radiation” when untrue) could severely damage credibility or even endanger lives. Pre-establishing trust and verification methods (such as digital signatures for official FPA communications) can help counter this threat.
