- _Action Steps:_  
- Make a checklist of basic squad equipment. Suggested minimums: First aid kit (with trauma supplies), a few high-vis vests, work gloves for all members, headlamps/flashlights with batteries, a battery-operated or hand-crank radio, dust masks, duct tape, tarps, a crowbar or multi-tool, and some bottled water and non-perishable snacks. Add any special items relevant to your local risks (chainsaw if in forest fire country, life vests if flood-prone, etc.).  
- Source creatively: run a donation drive in the community (people often have spare camping gear or tools lying around). Use social media or neighborhood apps to request items. Mention you’re an FPA squad doing this for community benefit – many are happy to give away things for a good cause.  
- Tap institutional sources: Ask local businesses for any spare emergency supplies or materials. Sometimes hardware stores will give a discount or donate items like buckets or shovels. Local government or CERT programs might have grants or leftover gear (e.g., CERT often provides a starter backpack; if some members took CERT, pool those supplies).  
- For any purchased items, look second-hand first (thrift stores for blankets, used equipment sales for tools). Every dollar saved is important. Keep receipts and records especially if you plan to seek reimbursement or demonstrate community support in grant applications later.
