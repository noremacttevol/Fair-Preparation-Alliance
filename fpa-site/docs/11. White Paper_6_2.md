2. **Milestone 2: First Squad Meeting**  
- _Real-World Example:_ In one FPA pilot town, three neighbors who barely knew each other met at a local cafe after a storm-induced blackout. Over coffee by flashlight, they swapped ideas and phone numbers – the humble start of that community’s first squad. Such informal first meetings, even with tiny attendance, set the cooperative tone.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ **Meet in person early.** Face-to-face interaction cements commitment in a way online chats don’t. Keep it informal and welcoming – remember, these are neighbors not military recruits. Early meetings often reveal hidden talents (the quiet retiree might be a former nurse; the teenager might know drones). Use this time to let everyone speak. **Lesson:** early inclusion builds member investment and surfaces skills and concerns you didn’t know existed.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Set a date, time, and accessible location (public library, community center, or someone’s backyard) for the inaugural squad meeting. Provide refreshments if possible – breaking bread breaks the ice.  
- Prepare a brief agenda: introductions, a recap of FPA’s purpose, an open brainstorm of local risks, and next steps. Keep it under 90 minutes.  
- Go around and have each person share their motivation for joining and any skills/resources they have. Take note of these openly (whiteboard or notepad).
