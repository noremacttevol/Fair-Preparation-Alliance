While FPA’s first responsibility is to its members, the Alliance also considers how to ethically and safely assist non-members (neighbors, community members, or strangers) during a crisis. The guiding principle is compassion balanced with caution. FPA recognizes that helping others in need is morally right and can build goodwill, but it must be done in a way that doesn’t jeopardize the group’s safety or deplete critical resources.  
Triage of Help: In a large-scale disaster, FPA can’t help everyone. The alliance informally triages situations: highest priority is aiding members and their immediate families; second priority might be trusted friends or nearby neighbors that members know well (often these folks have been indirectly involved or prepared, sometimes called “friends of FPA”). Third priority could be the general public in acute distress (e.g., pulling an injured stranger out of rubble or providing first aid to someone in the street). The idea is to do the greatest good FPA can without overextending.
