- Smoke Signals: In wildfire-safe conditions, smoke generators (like smoke canisters) or simply setting green branches on fire to create white smoke are taught as daytime signals. Some caches have rescue smoke flares.  
- Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs): A few members invest in PLBs or satellite SOS devices which, when activated, send a distress message with GPS coords to emergency services (this is more individual rescue tech than group, but FPA acknowledges their life-saving potential).
Through these means, if any member or team needs to be found or needs to guide others in, they have the gear to do so. Drills include signaling practiceâ€”like setting up a signal panel message or using mirrors. The overarching principle: no matter how off-grid or lost someone might be, they have a way to call for help or direct assistance to their location using simple, robust signaling tools.
