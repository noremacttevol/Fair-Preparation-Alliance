- Identify rally points: safe locations where the squad can gather during or after a disaster (preferably open area or high ground depending on scenario). Also decide on an emergency operations spot – maybe someone’s garage or a community building that can serve as a coordination center if possible. Mark these clearly.  
- Analyze the map as a group. Draw arrows for likely evacuation routes, note any single points of failure (e.g., only one bridge out of the area – what if it’s out?). Develop simple contingency plans for any critical point (alternate routes, etc.). Keep the map handy – take photos of it for digital reference and update as you discover new info.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If mapping tools or prints are unavailable, sketch from memory and verify by walking. Involve community elders who often have the best memory of past incidents – their knowledge is a goldmine if high-tech mapping isn’t in reach. If your area is too large for one map, break it into sectors and perhaps have sub-teams focus on each. Should critical infrastructure be outside your immediate area (like a power substation uphill), note it even if it’s not on your block; disasters don’t respect boundaries. Lastly, share relevant findings with local authorities if appropriate – it could help them too (for example, letting the fire department know about an obstructed hydrant or a vulnerable propane tank is good citizenship).
