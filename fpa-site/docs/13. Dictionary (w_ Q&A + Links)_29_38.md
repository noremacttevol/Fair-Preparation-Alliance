Q39: How long should I be able to sustain myself without outside help?
A: At minimum, you should be prepared to take care of yourself and your family for 3 days (72 hours) with no outside assistance – that’s the standard bare minimum often cited by agencies like FEMA. However, many real disasters (hurricanes, infrastructure failures, etc.) have shown that it can easily take longer than 3 days for outside help or normal services to reach everyone. Serious preppers often aim for at least 2 weeks of self-sufficiency (food, water, medicines, and other essentials for 14+ days). The more severe the potential scenario, the longer you’d plan for: some people prepare for 1–3 months or more for worst-case scenarios. But generally, having two weeks of supplies is a good practical goal for most households – it covers the majority of disasters short of a true long-term societal collapse.
