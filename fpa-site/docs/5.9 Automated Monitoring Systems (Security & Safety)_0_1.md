off (like a heart rate spiking, indicating panic or medical issue, which can be cross-checked if that person is currently in a dangerous task). These automated watchdogs mean FPA isn’t purely reactive; it can catch threats or issues in real time with minimal human oversight. For instance, an AI monitoring local news or emergency scanners might automatically page the group if a key trigger word is heard (“mandatory evacuation” or “chemical spill”). By integrating such systems, FPA essentially gets “eyes and ears” that never tire – enhancing security of their people and supplies and giving faster warning of trouble on the horizon or at the gate.
