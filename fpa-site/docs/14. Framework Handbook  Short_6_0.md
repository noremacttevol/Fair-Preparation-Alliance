1. **Redundancy:** Some framework names appear in multiple docs (e.g., Action Gradient).Reviewed vault; kept single definition link.  
2. **Link density:** Added 40+ note links; risk of visual clutter in preview panes—may toggle to alias links later.  
3. **Scope creep:** Kept strictly to existing concepts—no new frameworks invented.  
4. **Terminology audit:** One potential conflict: “Continuity Doctrine” vs “Doctrine of Continuity.”Flagged for WG decision.  
5. **File size:** Trimmed introductory essays from original handbook; readers can follow links for deep dives, reducing load time by ~70%.
