22. **Milestone 22: Establish Outernet/Offline Info Access**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A forward-thinking squad in a remote area set up an “Outernet hotspot” using a kit that downloads news and weather via satellite to a little Raspberry Pi computer. When a hurricane hit, even though they lost internet, the device kept receiving NOAA weather updates and emergency news, which the squad then shared on their bulletin board and by word of mouth. Elsewhere, a pilot project used Othernet (formerly Outernet) satellite receivers in villages with no internet – broadcasting cached Wikipedia articles and disaster guides via a local Wi-Fi hotspot. By 2026, initiatives like Rivada’s Outernet constellation aim to provide a self-contained global network independent of ground infrastructure ([Rivada to Fly Outernet Demo Mission in 2026 — Rivada Space Networks](https://rivadaspace.com/news/rivada-to-fly-outernet-demo-mission-in-2026#:~:text=The%20Outernet%20aims%20to%20be,without%20ever%20touching%20terrestrial%20internet)). FPA squads are poised to leverage these technologies so even when the world is cut off, information still flows to the people.
