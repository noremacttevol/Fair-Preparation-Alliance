In conclusion, Operational Readiness Progression is how FPA ensures that readiness is not a static label but a dynamic progression. It aligns with our belief that real readiness is a **lifestyle and a community practice**, not a one-time fix. And it cements the notion that everyone, from the newcomer to the veteran, has a next step to strive for â€“ keeping the alliance moving forward, ready for whatever comes next.
