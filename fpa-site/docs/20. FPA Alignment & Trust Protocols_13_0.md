#### Trust Stack Footer (Canonical Addendum)  
The Trust Stack Footer defines the immutable baseline for task delegation and elevation verification within FPA operational tiers. This patch inserts it as a codified closing to all trust-calibrated workflows.  
```markdown
## ðŸ”’ Trust Stack Footer (Canonical Logic)

- **T0 â€“ Assertion**: Any claim must be grounded in verifiable signal, timestamped, and witnessed (OpCheck).
- **T1 â€“ Reflection**: Squad Wheel check confirms interpersonal load and trust feedback loop.
- **T2 â€“ Validation**: Task routing must pass a Skill Delta fit-check for assigned role. Deviations flagged.
- **T3 â€“ Authorization**: Gear Pool inventory and elevation flags must be synced. Role lock if out-of-bounds.
- **T4 â€“ Confirmation**: TMP or scenario result sync required. Mission clock starts only after confirmation.
- **T5 â€“ Audit Trail**: Sync Dashboard must contain all elevation triggers + witness trail for retro-check.
```  
This footer binds TMP-confirmed flows to [[TERM:Trust Doctrine]] and provides a checksum for squad and ops lead validation cycles.
