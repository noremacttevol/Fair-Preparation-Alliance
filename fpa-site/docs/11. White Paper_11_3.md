- Encourage each region’s comms team to hold monthly on-air training nets open to all FPA members, bolstering overall radio proficiency across squads.
**Contingency Plan:** If no volunteer steps up in a region, identify a motivated member and provide extra remote coaching (e.g., an experienced HAM from another region conducts nightly training over radio or phone). Maintain a list of “surge” operators – experienced radio volunteers nationwide who can temporarily cover a region’s communications (remotely via HF radio) if that region’s team is offline. In case licensing rules complicate operations (e.g., no local licensed HAM during an emergency), use government exemptions for emergency communications or have pre-authorized licensed operators in adjacent regions transmit on behalf of unlicensed locals in crisis. Always have a down-to-earth fallback: if high-tech comms falter, even training on how to use a runner or courier to bridge gaps is included in the comm lead training.
