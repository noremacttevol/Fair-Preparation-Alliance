**Lessons Learned:** Early Phase 3 tests found a gap: some teams were listening to radio, others were watching Outernet, and info didn’t always cross over. We learned that without deliberate bridging, we risk creating parallel info silos. One lesson came from a simple oversight: the Outernet feed listed a new rendezvous point for supplies, but one squad missed it because their radio operator never checked the satellite printout. After that, we instituted that radio net control will reference any new Outernet updates at the start of each net meeting. Another lesson was to manage timing – radio is real-time, Outernet can have delays of an hour or two. So urgent radio calls shouldn’t wait for the satellite; they go out immediately by voice, then perhaps followed up in the next data cycle for completeness. By blending the systems, we reinforced the motto “never a single point of failure” in communications.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Develop an **integration protocol** document that details when and how information should be shared across HAM and Outernet. E.g., “If a squad reports a resource need that others can fill, relay it via radio to region lead **and** submit to Content Team for Outernet broadcast so all regions are informed within 6 hours.”
