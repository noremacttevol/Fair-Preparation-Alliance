**Phase1.4: Train at least 50 members in basic first aid and CERT by Q4 2025.**
_Real-world example:_ When disaster strikes, the first person to aid an injured family member or neighbor will likely be _you_, not a paramedic. In a major crisis, 911 may be overloaded or unreachable. For instance, in the minutes after a tornado hit a community in Oklahoma, an FPA member with recent CERT training triaged and treated three injured neighbors before ambulances arrived 45 minutes later. Those neighbors later credited that immediate help with preventing worse outcomes. Community Emergency Response Team (_CERT_) training is a national program (often free) that teaches regular people how to perform light search and rescue, basic medical care, and safety assessment in disasters. Another case: during a local drill, an FPA member learned how to properly use a tourniquet and then used that knowledge in a real car accident scene months later, likely saving a life. The milestone isn’t just about certificates; it’s about **practical lifesaving skills** in the hands of our members. We target 50 members as a start, focusing on regions prone to disasters, but ultimately want every member to have at least basic first aid competence.
