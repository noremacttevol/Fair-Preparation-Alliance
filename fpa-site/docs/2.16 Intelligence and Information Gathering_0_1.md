prepper nets) and exchange reports. For instance, an FPA ham might check in to a statewide emergency net and get information from other counties or transmit a request (like asking if a certain highway is open). Crowdsourced Intelligence: Through the Realnet or other online means (when available), FPA gathers intel from its own members and allies across regions. Each member reports what they personally observe: “Bridge on Route 5 collapsed,” “The grocery store in town was emptied by 10 AM,” “Military convoy seen heading north,” etc. These are compiled to build a picture. A designated intelligence coordinator (even informally, someone good at synthesizing info) might maintain a whiteboard or digital pad with key info points and updates for the leadership to use in decision-making. Social Media and Internet (Phase 1 and early Phase 2): If internet is still up, some members will scan Twitter, Facebook groups, Nextdoor, etc., which can provide hyper-local updates (sometimes faster than official news). Knowing which sources are credible is important; FPA might have a list of reliable local Twitter accounts or community pages to check.

They will sometimes send out members for reconnaissance if safe. For example, if they haven’t heard news about a nearby town where another chapter is, they might dispatch a
