**Not Just Visibility:** Traditional marketing measures success in views, clicks, or followers – essentially **visibility**. FPA’s approach rejects vanity metrics. We measure success in **readiness** and **resilience**: How many families have a plan because of our outreach? How many local “squads” (preparedness teams) exist where none did before? How quickly do our messages translate into on-the-ground action? Our goal isn’t popularity; it’s capability. If a message goes viral but fails to prompt preparedness, it is _not_ a success. Conversely, a modest outreach that forms a tight-knit community group is a huge win. In FPA, outreach is mission-critical infrastructure, not PR.  
**Proactive and Reactive:** Our strategy blends **proactive** education with **reactive** crisis communication. In peacetime, we are proactively spreading skills, recruiting volunteers, and establishing channels. In disaster, we react and pivot those channels to urgent needs. The two modes feed each other: proactive outreach builds a reservoir of goodwill and knowledge that reactive communications draw upon to be effective. We don’t wait for the storm to hit to start talking to the public – by then it’s too late. We start now, consistently, so that when a storm comes, our warnings and guidance carry the weight of trust and familiarity.  
**Summary of Outreach’s Strategic Role:**  
- _Community Shield_: Information distributed in advance acts as a shield against misinformation and panic.
