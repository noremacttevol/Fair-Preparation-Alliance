- _Contingency Plan:_ If travel or communication is tough (say rural areas), maintain at least a phone/email relationship with key people in adjacent communities or groups. Even a once-a-year coordination call is better than nothing. Should a large-scale disaster strike, be prepared that VOAD or coordination might be slow – your squad’s first duty is still local action. But as soon as feasible, loop into any broader coordination to avoid duplication or resource conflicts. If you encounter turf wars (some orgs might not play nice), stick to FPA’s ethos of transparency and fairness – share information openly and act in the community’s best interest, not for credit. Over time, genuine service tends to win respect.
