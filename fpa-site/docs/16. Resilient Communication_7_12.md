- **Inter-Agency Coordination:** At this stage, members often interface with other groups or authorities (if the Alliance is cooperating in a larger relief effort, for example). They know how to bridge the Alliance network with external networks safely. For example, how to funnel intel from our nets to an aid organization without exposing sensitive internal info. Or how to request external resources via official emergency channels effectively. Phase 4 training includes knowledge of national emergency communication frameworks (like FEMA’s ICS forms, international distress frequencies, etc.), so they can plug FPA into the bigger picture when advantageous.  
- **Advanced Technology and Intelligence:** Phase 4 keeps abreast of advanced communication tech that could aid us: e.g., developments in low-earth-orbit satellite messengers, new mesh networking protocols, improvements in EMP shielding tech, etc. They evaluate and recommend if the Alliance should adopt or reject such technologies (balancing advanced capability with resilience – e.g., reliance on satellites which we don’t control may be a vulnerability). They might run pilot programs with new gear in a controlled way. They also handle intelligence: monitoring global news, solar weather alerts (so we can brace for solar flares), and geopolitical events that could presage comms disruptions (per Trust Doctrine, we want truth and foresight).
