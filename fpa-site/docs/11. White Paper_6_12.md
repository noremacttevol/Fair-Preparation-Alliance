- _Lessons Learned:_ **Training = credibility and capability.** Adopting established training (CERT, Red Cross, etc.) gives the squad common procedures and confidence. It also reassures professional responders that you’re not a ragtag group to be ignored. Even low-resource communities can access these trainings since they are often free. **Lesson:** Make use of what’s already out there; you don’t need to reinvent the wheel on basic disaster skills. And train **before** an incident – during one, it’s too late to Google how to do CPR.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Contact your local emergency management agency or fire department to find out about CERT training classes in your area. If none are scheduled, request one – many EM offices will organize a class if there’s sufficient interest (usually 15+ people).  
- Encourage all squad members to enroll. If scheduling is an issue, have them take FEMA’s **IS-317: Introduction to CERT** online as a primer ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=Whether%20you%27re%20already%20in%20the,free%20and%20available%20to%20anyone)).
