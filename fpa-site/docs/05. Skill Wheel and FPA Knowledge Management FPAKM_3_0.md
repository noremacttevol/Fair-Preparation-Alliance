Within each category segment, a **filled portion** of the segment indicates the member’s current proficiency or preparedness level in that domain. This works like a radial progress bar: for example, if a member is roughly 50% proficient in First Aid, the First Aid segment will be filled about halfway outward from the center. A completely filled segment (reaching the wheel’s outer edge) represents 100% in that skill area. Importantly, **100% is an idealized target rather than an actually attainable state** – as discussed later, no member will ever truly reach 100%, reflecting the philosophy of ongoing improvement.
