- **Phase 2: Growth and Partial Automation.** Phase 2 kicks in as we surpass roughly 5,000 members (scaling up to ~50,000). Here, we begin deploying **partial AI support** and more structured organization to handle the larger membership. We roll out the full FPA app with integrated FPAi assistant to all members, providing things like automated plan reviews (**Test My Plan**) and personalized training suggestions. However, we still maintain human oversight on all AI outputs.

We also start bringing in alternate funding (sponsors, merchandise, donations) to supplement or eventually replace member dues. The key danger in Phase 2 is complexity – but we tackle it by **standardizing where needed and leveraging tech for management**. We’ll use
