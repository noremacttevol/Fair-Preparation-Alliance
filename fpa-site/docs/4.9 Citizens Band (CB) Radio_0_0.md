CB radio is a classic communication method that remains useful, particularly for mobile and vehicular communication. FPA members who travel or convoy during evacuations often have CB radios installed in their vehicles, allowing coordination on the road. Channel 9 on CB is historically the emergency channel, and Channel 19 is commonly used by truckers (good for getting traffic updates or help on highways). The Alliance might plan to use a specific CB channel (other than 9/19) as a hailing channel for member convoys, then switch to a working channel for conversations. No license is needed for CB, and it can reach several miles car-to-car, especially in open terrain. It’s also AM modulation, which means it can sometimes be heard at longer distances in good conditions (skip propagation). FPA includes CB in its training for those likely to use it: learning the CB lingo (though plain language is fine, members might hear terms like “10-4” for acknowledgment or “breaker” to request to speak). Handheld CB radios exist too, which some members keep in their base camp kits. While CB is not used for day-to-day chatter in FPA, it’s an excellent backup and supplement: for instance, if an evacuation leads multiple families down highways, they all monitor the chosen CB channel to keep in touch when out of range of FRS/GMRS. It extends the Alliance’s communication reach particularly in vehicles and adds to the redundancy (if all else fails, one can try calling on CB for any nearby assistance).
