The two systems also provide redundancy: Realnet might carry an internal news bulletin, but Outernet could serve as a backup source if local news is wrong or vice versa. When FPA educates members, it clarifies this difference: Outernet = receive global data reliably, Realnet = communicate locally interactively. Both require preparation: Outernet needs the right gear and knowing what channels to listen to; Realnet needs community hardware and agreed protocols. By developing both, FPA covers both information intake and internal coordination in a grid-down world, creating a holistic communication ecosystem that doesnâ€™t depend on traditional internet at all.
