Lastly, use your fellow FPA members as resources. If you’re struggling with a particular item (say, you can’t find a good deal on a generator or you’re unsure how to bury a cache), ask around – someone likely has advice or a spare item to help you. We succeed as a team or fail alone; FPA chooses to succeed together.  
**Stay accountable, stay active, and keep pushing forward.** This checklist will evolve as we enter new phases, but the fundamentals won’t. And neither will the expectation that an FPA member is someone who _gets things done_. Be that member. Your community and the entire Alliance are counting on it.  
_Now, check your gear, charge your radio, and let’s get to work._ ✔️
