Readiness Audits: This team conducts periodic readiness audits of squads and regions – essentially preparedness inspections. They check that members’ gear is up to date, caches are maintained (no expired food, fuel rotated, batteries charged), rally points are still viable (that abandoned barn chosen last year—is it still accessible/safe?), and so on. They might do surprise “health checks” via the app or in person. Results of these audits inform where to focus training or support. If a region consistently lags (e.g., people aren’t showing up to drills or failing gear checks), Readiness will alert Core Coordination and work to find the root cause (maybe shuffle local leadership or inject resources). The goal is uniform excellence – find and strengthen any weak links before a real emergency exploits them.
