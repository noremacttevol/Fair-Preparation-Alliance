- **100%** – intentionally **unreachable.** We frame 100% as an asymptote: you can approach it (90%, 95% perhaps with immense effort), but 100% represents theoretical perfect preparedness – something that doesn’t exist in reality. By never awarding a full 100%, the system reinforces a mindset of **lifelong learning and humility.** There’s _always_ something new to learn, some skill to refresh, or some edge to sharpen. Even top experts must respect that disasters are unpredictable. In practice, members might consider anything above ~90% as “maxed out,” but even then the system will show that small gap to perfection to encourage a growth mindset.  
We will communicate this philosophy during member onboarding and training. It’s important that members understand the Skill Wheel is **not a game to be “beaten”** or an exam to get 100% on – it’s a mirror and map for personal preparedness. We plan to include explanatory notes in official references (possibly as entries in the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]] or the member handbook) about what different percentage ranges mean in plain language. This is similar to practices in some elite organizations (for example, certain military or special forces evaluations purposely avoid ever giving a “100/100” score) to keep people striving for improvement and acknowledging that conditions and requirements can evolve.
