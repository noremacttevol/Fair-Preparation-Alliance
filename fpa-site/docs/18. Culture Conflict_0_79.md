Confidentiality and Need-to-Know: While we champion transparency, conflict resolution often involves sensitive personal information or accusations. We safeguard participants’ privacy by limiting details to those who need to be involved. Mediators and panels might ask participants to agree to confidentiality for the duration of the process to allow candid sharing. Outcomes can be communicated in a respectful way that doesn’t broadcast personal matters. For example, if a team conflict is resolved with one member choosing to transfer teams, the public message might simply be “so-and-so is moving to another team; we wish them well” without detailing the conflict, unless the parties agree to share. This balance ensures people aren’t afraid to come forward because “everyone will know my business.” However, confidentiality is not absolute if it clashes with accountability – for instance, a leader who was found to harass subordinates cannot hide behind confidentiality to prevent the Alliance from knowing they were disciplined. In such cases, we disclose what is necessary (e.g., “a leadership change occurred due to violation of our values”) while still protecting victim identities.
