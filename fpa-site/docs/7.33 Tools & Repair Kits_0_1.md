- Hardware: A small assortment of nails, screws, and wire nuts can enable building or repairing structures when combined with found wood or scrap.  
- Sharpening Tool: A knife sharpener or file to maintain blades and tools.  
- Crowbar/Pinch bar: A small crowbar helps with prying open crates, doors or removing nails safely.
These tools empower members to improvise and overcome challenges â€“ from building a shelter from raw materials to fixing a leaking pipe at a retreat. The Alliance often runs workshops on basic handy skills using these tools so everyone knows, say, how to safely use an axe or properly sew a tear. By equipping themselves with even a modest toolset, FPA ensures that when something breaks, they can likely fix it, rig it, or craft a workaround, turning potential setbacks into minor hiccups.
