- **Shelter and warmth:** Evaluate your region and season. Do you need a way to keep warm if heating fails? For cold climates, store extra blankets, sleeping bags (rated for freezing temps if possible), and safe indoor heating options (e.g., a Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater, ~$80, with proper ventilation). In hot climates, focus on cooling and hydration – have a battery-operated fan, and knowledge of cooling techniques (like hanging wet sheets). If your home might become uninhabitable, have basic shelter in your go-bag (tents, tarps, etc., which can be inexpensive or even thrifted).  
- **Hygiene and sanitation:** Don’t overlook sanitation. Store extra toiletries: toilet paper, feminine products, soap, trash bags (can double as toilet liners or rain ponchos), and bleach for disinfecting. A five-gallon bucket with a lid can serve as an emergency toilet (line with garbage bag and use a bit of cat litter if available to reduce smell). These items are cheap now, priceless later.  
- **Personalize your kit:** Add items based on personal needs – baby formula, pet food, eyeglasses, hearing aid batteries, etc. Use the FPAi Chatbot or Compass Guide’s checklist to brainstorm items you might forget. Make a checklist and slowly acquire these as means allow. Many things can be sourced second-hand or via community swaps (the FPA app has a section where members give away extra gear locally – take advantage).
