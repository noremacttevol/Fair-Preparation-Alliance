- **Outernet Integration:** Tech & App Dev manages our interface with the **Outernet** (Othernet) data broadcast. They decide what data we should push out via satellite and set up the equipment and encoding to do so. This might involve curating a daily or weekly data package that gets beamed: could be a compressed HTML bulletin, or even binary files like updated maps or PDFs of new training content. They’ll work on ensuring every region has at least one Outernet receiver (ideally many) to collect incoming data. They likely also manage any specialized hardware builds – e.g., designing a cheap DIY receiver kit that FPA members can assemble (perhaps using a small satellite antenna and an SDR – software-defined radio – with instructions). And if possible, they experiment with sending data up as well (maybe via leased bandwidth or piggybacking on amateur radio satellites) to make our network two-way global. The Outernet integration is all about **global reach without reliance on terrestrial internet**, and this team makes it happen technically.
