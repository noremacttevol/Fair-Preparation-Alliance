**(3) Living Knowledge Base (Dictionary + SOP Hub)**
**What it is:** A **living, breathing knowledge repository** that combines an extensive _Preparedness Dictionary_ of terms with a hub of _Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)_ and guides. Unlike a static library, this knowledge base is continuously updated by members and FPA experts – it’s our centralized brain trust of all things preparedness. The Dictionary provides clear definitions for jargon and concepts (from “SHTF” to “Zone 1 Rescue”), while the SOP Hub houses step-by-step protocols (e.g., how to purify water, how to secure your home during a hurricane). It’s all interlinked and searchable, evolving as we learn more.
