- **Post-Endorsement Vendor Conduct:** If a product is endorsed, we expect the vendor to uphold the standards that earned that endorsement. They are not formally bound to us, but any misuse of our endorsement (like using our badge in advertising without permission or implying FPA recommends something when we don’t) is taken seriously. We have a strict **endorsement badge usage policy**: vendors must get approval for any marketing mention, and it must be truthful (e.g., “FPA endorsed [Product] as of 2025” is fine, but “FPA says this is the only tool you need!” is not). Unauthorized or exaggerated use of our name will result in public correction and potential blacklisting. Similarly, if an endorsed vendor suddenly spikes their price taking advantage of our endorsement, we consider that unethical: we may reach out and urge fair pricing – and if they refuse, our Pricing Transparency protocols (next section) kick in, possibly including a public statement that we no longer view the pricing as fair (even if the product itself works, price gouging can trigger an endorsement review).
