**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** We plan to refine these tools and roll out guidelines for their use. Next steps: (a) Enhance the **Merge-Logic algorithm** – incorporate more factors like trust relationships (from Trust Graph) and availability (some squads had people who could only meet weekends vs weekdays). We’ll run a new analysis across all regions to spot any remaining suboptimal structures and propose merges/splits, to be reviewed in upcoming regional coordinator meetings. (b) Add features to Squad Hub: a **mapping feature** to visualize squad member locations (approximate, respecting privacy) to aid in quick rallying, and a **task assignment** tracker so squads can delegate and check off preparedness tasks (like “team vehicle maintenance” or “drill scheduling”). (c) Develop a **Squad Lifecycle SOP** – guidance on how squads form, when to merge, when to spin off new squads, and how to welcome new members (a consistent onboarding flow in the Squad Hub for instance). Over the next 30 days, we aim for 90% of squads to adopt the tools. We’ll conduct a survey on squad satisfaction and effectiveness before and after using these tools to measure impact (we anticipate improvements in communication and clarity of roles). Additionally, we plan a **“Squad Exchange” event**, where two squads from different regions pair up virtually to share how they operate – facilitated through the Squad Hub – strengthening cross-squad learning and maybe revealing further merge opportunities
