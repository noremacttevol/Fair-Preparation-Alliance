Physical Fitness & Health: Preparedness isn’t just gear and knowledge – it’s also personal fitness and resilience. Readiness & Drills emphasizes baseline physical conditioning appropriate to each member’s role. They might set fitness benchmarks, especially for those in field or leadership roles. For example, every member should be able to walk 5 miles with their go-bag, or do a certain number of push-ups, etc. They provide workout recommendations and maybe group PT sessions (not to turn FPA into boot camp, but because if you can’t run or lift when needed, all the gear in the world won’t save you). They include mental resilience training too – acknowledging crises are stressful, they teach stress inoculation techniques, breathing exercises, etc., so our people are mentally tough as well as physically.
