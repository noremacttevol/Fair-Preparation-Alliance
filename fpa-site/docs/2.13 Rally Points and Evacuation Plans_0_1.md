primary route (fastest) and a backup route (maybe longer or through back roads but likely passable if main roads are jammed or dangerous). During planning, members share local knowledge of shortcuts, choke points, and hazards along these routes. They also consider modes: if car travel is not possible (roads blocked or fuel shortages), what is the walking or biking route? Members are encouraged to do a trial run of these routes in normal times to familiarize themselves. Procedure on Evacuation: When an evacuation order or decision is made (either by authorities or by FPA internal call), members execute their personal home evacuation plan (grabbing go-bags, securing home, etc.) and head to the rally point via the planned routes. The [[Emergency Activation Protocols]] would often trigger this. The first member(s) to arrive at a rally assume temporary responsibility to note who’s coming in and to secure the area. If it’s an outdoor spot, they might scout for any threats or clear a space for parking/tents. Accountability at Rally: As members arrive, they check in with whoever is tracking (perhaps a designated rally leader). If someone doesn’t show up within expected time, that info is logged and after a grace period, the group may send a team back or on their route to search (resources permitting). They also might leave a message or sign at the rally point for latecomers – e.g., chalk mark or note saying where the group went next if they had to move. On-Site Actions: Depending on
