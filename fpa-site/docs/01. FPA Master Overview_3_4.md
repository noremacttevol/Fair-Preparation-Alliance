- **Expanded Training with Simulation:** AI also assists in training. We introduce **simulation drills** where scenarios are partly driven by AI to challenge members. For example, an AI-generated disaster scenario can be fed to a regional team during a drill: it will simulate news feeds, casualty numbers, and “injects” (unexpected developments) to test our responses. This could mean an AI sends a squad leader a simulated message like “Bridge on Route5 is down, find alternate evacuation path,” forcing on-the-fly adaptation. These training simulations help squads **think on their feet**. We keep it aggressive and realistic – after action, the AI helps debrief by pointing out where decisions diverged from optimal and suggesting improvements. It’s tough love, but it saves lives later.  
- **Maintaining Manual Prowess:** A critical aspect of Phase2 is **not losing our Phase1 skills**. We schedule periodic “comms-out” days where all AI and high-tech features are deliberately disabled, forcing everyone to revert to Phase1 mode for a day or a drill. This keeps us from growing complacent. Our people remain fully capable of analog operation even as they gain comfort with AI tools. The Alliance emphasizes _tech is a tool, not a crutch_. Every member is reminded: **if the fancy stuff dies, we don’t.**
