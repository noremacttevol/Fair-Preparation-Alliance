9. **Community Outreach & Training:** Points for activities that spread preparedness beyond the Alliance – such as hosting public workshops, giving preparedness presentations, recruiting new members, or organizing public-facing drills and community events.  
10. **Mission & Project Contributions:** Points for contributing to official missions or projects of the Alliance. This can range from staff work on a regional mission, assisting in logistics for an event, to creating educational content or tools for the group. Significant innovation (like developing a new training course or a custom piece of gear adopted Alliance-wide) also falls here.  
Members can earn AP in any combination of these categories, encouraging a diverse skill set. However, **major rank milestones have specific tasks that must be done to advance** – you can’t substitute one category for another when it comes to those required tasks. For example, no matter how many points you earn from attending drills, you _must_ still pass the radio license exam to reach the rank that requires it. The AP system is meant to reward ongoing engagement and allow some personalization, while the required rank tasks ensure every member has the critical skills and experiences appropriate to their level.
