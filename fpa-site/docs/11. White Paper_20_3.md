- Use CERT’s existing evaluation drills as a low-cost way to gauge squad readiness – basically piggyback on their simulations rather than always staging our own, saving resources.
**Contingency Plan:** If local CERT programs show resistance or bureaucracy slows cooperation, pursue alternate routes like partnering with Red Cross community classes or state guard volunteer programs for similar training. Also, cultivate our own “FPA-CERT” liaisons – members who are dual FPA and CERT volunteers – to be bridges even if official channels stall. In areas without a strong CERT presence (rural regions), adapt CERT curriculum to run FPA-led basic training workshops (essentially FPA becomes the CERT equivalent there). Should any CERT guidelines conflict with FPA’s ethos (e.g., CERT says wait for officials, while FPA leans toward immediate action), clarify that FPA members in CERT exercises follow those rules for that context, but in real events will act under the Trust Doctrine and then integrate when officials arrive. Maintaining respect and clear communication will prevent turf wars and ensure FPA can still function independently if needed while having the benefit of CERT’s knowledge base.
