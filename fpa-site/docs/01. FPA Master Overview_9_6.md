- These drills are **mandatory to a degree** – members must participate in a minimum number per year to stay active (with exceptions for genuine scheduling issues, then they have to make it up). The reason is simple: _unpracticed skills atrophy_. FPA is not a paper organization; if you’re in it, you’re drilling. Readiness team documents each drill, logs participation (feeding AP and evaluating who might be promotion-ready or who needs remediation).  
- **Assessment & Certification:** This content family certifies members in various competencies. They might run a certification program akin to merit badges or military quals: e.g., Certified Medic (FPA-CM Level1, Level2), Certified Comms Operator, Fireteam Leader Certification, etc. When members achieve these, it’s recorded in their profile, contributing to AP and credibility for certain roles. Certification involves both training and testing. Readiness & Drills develops the tests – written, oral, and practical. They also identify and train **instructors and examiners** within the ranks to multiply training capacity.
