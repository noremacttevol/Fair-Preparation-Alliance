- **Use the “honest coach” approach:** Mentors should be supportive but direct. If a mentee hasn’t done what they said they would, address it bluntly: e.g., “You said you’d buy a fire extinguisher by now – what’s the holdup? Let’s figure out why and solve it.” Mentees, be open about your challenges (time, money, family buy-in, etc.). The more honest you both are, the more practical the solutions. Remember, the goal is to actually get things done, not just talk.  
- **Skill exchange:** Mentorship doesn’t imply one person knows everything. It’s likely each of you has strengths. Maybe the mentor is great at medical skills while the mentee is an IT whiz who can set up mesh networks. Swap knowledge. Schedule a session where the “junior” teaches the “senior” one of their skills (for instance, a mentee might teach the mentor how to use a new secure messaging app or blockchain wallet for FPA). This keeps the relationship reciprocal and respectful.  
- **Accountability checks:** Use simple accountability tools – for instance, share photos as proof of progress (“Here’s my updated bug-out bag contents laid out on the floor” or “Here’s me at the firing range practicing with my pepper spray”). It’s not about policing, it’s about celebrating progress and keeping it real. Many people respond well to the little dopamine hit of showing someone else “I did it.”
