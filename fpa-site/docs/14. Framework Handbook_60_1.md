- **Transparency in Operations:** At the alliance level, we’ve implemented more transparent communication channels. There are regular updates from FPA coordinators about what’s happening across the network – successes, challenges, finances, etc. We use our app and radio bulletins to share this. The more members feel “in the loop,” the more they trust the organization leading them.  
- **Conflict Resolution Mechanism:** Even in a community of well-intentioned folks, conflicts or misunderstandings arise. Mk1Mod3 has a simple conflict resolution SOP: if two members or squads have an issue, they first attempt to resolve it privately; if that fails, a neutral mediator (often a respected squad leader from another area) is invited to help. The Trust Doctrine insists on addressing issues head-on rather than letting resentment fester. We’ve found that most disputes in volunteer groups stem from miscommunication. A quick mediation can clear the air and preserve trust.
