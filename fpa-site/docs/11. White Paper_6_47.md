- _Lessons Learned:_ Working with government can greatly amplify your reach (access to warnings, inclusion in coordinated response) if done correctly. However, it requires patience and proving competence. **ICS alignment** means your squad understands how official command works and fits in rather than creating chaos. **Lesson:** Be proactively transparent and cooperative with authorities – it builds trust. At the same time, maintain your squad’s autonomy; you are a partner, not subordinates, which actually helps officials because you’re self-sufficient. If authorities ignore or reject help, the squad should be prepared to operate independently _safely_, but giving them the chance to integrate you can reduce duplication and conflict.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Identify the local emergency management coordinator (often a county level position or city emergency manager) and local first responder leadership (fire chief, police chief, etc.). Draft a polite letter or email introducing your squad, highlighting training (CERT, first aid, etc.), and requesting a brief meeting to discuss how you can support in emergencies.
