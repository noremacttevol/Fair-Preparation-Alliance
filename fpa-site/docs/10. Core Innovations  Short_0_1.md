## Guiding Principles
- **Offline-First by Default**  ▸ each innovation degrades gracefully when the grid fails.
- **Human-Verified Trust**  ▸ AI supports, but people approve.
- **Iterate in 30-Day Sprints**  ▸ every initiative owns a rolling roadmap.
- **Radical Transparency** ▸ progress and metrics surface in the [[Live Audit Feed]].
- **Interlinked Knowledge** ▸ every directive references its detailed SOP, dictionary term, or playbook.
