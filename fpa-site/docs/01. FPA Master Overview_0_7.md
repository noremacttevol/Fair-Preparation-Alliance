Enhanced Communication Network: With Phase2, we bolster communications using technology. The app enables secure messaging and alerts to all members (again, its offline-first design means messages queue and send whenever a path is available – internet, SMS, radio packet, etc.). We also tap into the Outernet – using satellite broadcasts (Othernet) to push important Alliance updates globally. For instance, FPA can send an encrypted daily bulletin via Outernet that any member’s receiver can pick up. This might include intel like areas to avoid, safe rendezvous points, relief convoy schedules, etc. The Outernet feed is one-way but extremely robust (works anywhere with a small receiver dish). Meanwhile, our 7.200MHz pulse frequency remains active; Phase2 tech lets us link radio comms with the digital network. Some regional hubs set up radio-to-internet gateways that can take a text bulletin and broadcast it in audio via 7.200MHz for those without the app or when the digital side fails. Multiple redundant channels is the goal: if you don’t get the message one way, you’ll get it another.
