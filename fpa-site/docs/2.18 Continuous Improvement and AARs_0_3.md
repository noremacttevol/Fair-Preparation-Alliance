often prompted by internal analysis discussions. This agility means FPA’s strategies are not static; they evolve with time.

Via Realnet forums or leadership meetings, they might share an AAR summary: “During the recent wildfire in our area, Chapter X learned we needed more escape routes. All chapters in wildfire-prone regions, please take note of our attached report and consider your own plans.” This way mistakes or innovations in one locale benefit all.

New members quickly see that feedback is welcomed and that the group is serious about improvement, which encourages them to speak up with ideas too.
