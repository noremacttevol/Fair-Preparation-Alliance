- **Flex Teams & Rapid Response Tasking:** Core Coordination can form **ad-hoc “flex teams”** drawn from various content families to tackle special projects or urgent tasks. Say we want to put together an effort to help fight wildfires in a certain area – Core will pull in folks from Readiness (for volunteers with firefighting skill), Tech (to bring drones or mapping software), Comms (to liaise with local authorities and media), etc., and build a task force with a clear leader. They give that team a mission, authority, and a deadline. Once done, team disbands back to their roles. This flexible coordination ensures we **punch above our weight** by bringing the right mix of talents to bear quickly. It prevents silos – no content family works in isolation when there’s a big mission; Core Coordination ties them together.
