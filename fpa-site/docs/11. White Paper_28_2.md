**Lessons Learned:** We learned to view AI as a tool, not a leader. Early on, some members were wary, thinking “AI deployment” meant a robo-commander – we clarified it’s more like having a super-smart secretary/analyst. Transparency was key: we open-sourced our AI’s suggestion algorithms where possible, so members knew it wasn’t manipulating behind the scenes. One lesson was to fine-tune the AI with real FPA data; off-the-shelf, it gave some weird suggestions (like dispatching teams long-distance when locals were available). By training it on actual scenarios and feedback (“no, don’t send heavy generators by bicycle just because nearest road is closed”), it got more context-aware. We also set boundaries: e.g., AI could flag communications that seem toxic or spammy on our forums, but it cannot ban anyone – that triggers a human moderator to review, keeping final authority with people. The oversight AI pointing out Trust Doctrine issues proved helpful – though occasionally too pedantic, it forced us to articulate and sometimes improve our principles to satisfy both human and machine logic.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Identify key areas where AI can help: likely inventory/resource management, scheduling, information triage, and document analysis. Avoid areas that require empathy or complex judgment (those remain human-led).
