their standing. Another development is linking the Trust Graph to the **Gear Swap/Trade system** we are piloting – members with higher trust might be able to borrow gear or participate in trades more freely, whereas low-trust members might need escrow or oversight (preventing theft or misuse). Over the next month, we’ll monitor closely for any signs of gaming the system or biases and adjust accordingly (with our AI Oversight, Innovation 12, also auditing the fairness). By month’s end, our goal is that every active member understands their trust level and has at least 1-2 endorsements, and that the overall network of trust is dense enough that we truly have a _web of trust_ spanning the alliance. The true success will be a culture where reputation is earned through deeds, and members can **rely on the Trust Graph** to choose collaboration partners confidently, knowing it’s backed by community experience.
