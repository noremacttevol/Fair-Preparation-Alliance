Perhaps the most striking insight is the psychological and memetic role FPA can play. If it succeeds, it could change the narrative of how communities deal with uncertainty – from one of fear and every-person-for-themselves, to one of shared responsibility and empowerment. In a sense, FPA’s highest achievement would be to render itself ordinary – no longer a “fringe” idea that people prepare and help each other, but a normal part of community life, as mundane yet vital as volunteer firefighting or local first aid squads.  
In conclusion, the Fair Preparation Alliance stands at a critical juncture. It has the blueprint of a system that combines the best of global resilience practices with a fresh ethos of fairness and unity. To realize its vision, it must diligently address its vulnerabilities, learn and adapt via comparisons with established systems, and guard against threats to its mission. If it can navigate these challenges, FPA may well become a cornerstone of societal resilience in the 21st century – a grassroots alliance that not only prepares for crisis, but in doing so, helps avert the worst outcomes by binding communities together. The road from fringe to mainstream is arduous, but given the state of the world, perhaps the timing has never been better for an idea like FPA to take root and flourish.
