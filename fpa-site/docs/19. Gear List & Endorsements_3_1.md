2. **Member Audit & Field Testing:** Once a gear tip is logged, volunteer members and local squads step up to audit and test the item. This is a hands-on evaluation phase. It involves researching the manufacturer’s claims, checking for any known issues or reviews, and—critically—obtaining the gear for real-world testing whenever possible. Local FPA squads might purchase a unit (or use a donated sample, if offered – under strict transparency) and put it through its paces: does the water filter actually purify to the claimed standard? Will the PowerMaxX solar charger actually charge a radio after three cloudy days? Tests are done in conditions that simulate emergency use (off-grid, rough handling, no tech support). All findings are recorded in a **Gear Audit Journal** (see Appendix A for the checklist) – noting both successes and failures, with photos or data for proof. _In our example, squads in Arizona and Ohio each test the PowerMaxX charger: one under desert sun, another during a cloudy winter – revealing how it performs in different conditions._ **Rationale:** Direct member testing exposes any gap between marketing and reality. By involving multiple testers (preferably from different regions or skill sets), we avoid one person’s bias or a single good/bad unit skewing the results. This phase is the heart of “truth-based validation,” turning up facts that a spec sheet or online ad won’t tell you.
