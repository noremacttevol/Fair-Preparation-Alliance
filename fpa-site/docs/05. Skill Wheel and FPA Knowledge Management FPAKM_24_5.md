- **Elite Certification Paths:** Consider programs like becoming a certified emergency manager, a master SCUBA diver, or a black belt in martial arts. These programs require **mastery of a breadth of sub-skills through staged progression**. For example, to achieve Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts’ highest rank), one must earn a variety of merit badges across diverse categories: first aid, citizenship, fitness, outdoorsmanship, etc. This ensures a well-rounded skill set – directly paralleling our requirement that FPA members develop all core areas, not just one. In our context, you can liken each Skill Wheel segment to a “merit badge category,” except we allow partial progress (you don’t either have it or not – you can be 40% toward completing a certain set of skills). Another example: **SCUBA diving certifications (PADI)**. As a diver, you start as Open Water certified, then perhaps Advanced Open Water (which requires navigation dives, deep dives among others), then Rescue Diver (adding rescue and first aid skills), and eventually Master Scuba Diver which requires experience in many different conditions (night dive, search and recovery dive, etc.). By the time someone is a Master Diver, they’ve accumulated a broad range of experiences. The lesson we take is the value of **progressive training with expanding scope**. That’s why we built the phase progression and tie-ins to rank: as members advance, we expect a broader set of experiences. Also, elite communities instill the mindset
