FPA establishes rally points as predetermined meeting locations where members can gather in an emergency, especially if communication is down or if evacuation is necessary. Each chapter usually has multiple rally points: a primary and one or two alternates (in case the primary is compromised by the situation). Selection of Rally Points: These locations are chosen carefully during Phase 1. They need to be known to all members, relatively easy to reach from members’ homes, and safe (or at least safer than staying put) for the scenario envisioned. Often rally points might be a member’s home that is in a defensible or less affected location, a public landmark (like a park, trailhead, or church parking lot) known to all, or a spot outside immediate danger zones (e.g., outside a floodplain or city center). For widespread disasters, a rally might be outside the city entirely—like a rest stop along a highway. The alternate rally points are typically in opposite directions; if the disaster blocks one route, members can go to the other. Each rally point is coded in communications (for OPSEC, they might say “Rally Alpha” meaning one spot, “Rally Bravo” meaning alternate). Evacuation Routes: FPA works out at least two evacuation routes for each member or sub-group to reach rally points – a primary route (fastest) and a backup route (maybe longer or through back roads but likely passable if main roads are jammed or dangerous). During planning, members share local knowledge of shortcuts,
