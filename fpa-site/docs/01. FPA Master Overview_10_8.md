- **Signal vs. Noise Management:** One challenge in any comms environment is avoiding overload. Comms team sets policies on **signal-to-noise**: making sure important messages aren’t drowned in chatter. They might enforce rules on official channels (like, use a separate forum for memes or off-topic so the main channels stay focused). They moderate online groups or the app’s community boards to keep discussions productive and aligned with our mission. Toxic behavior, spam, or fear-mongering is quickly addressed. They want comms to be **calm, factual, and action-oriented** especially in a crisis, so they train members on how to communicate then (e.g., use specific formats like SALUTE report for incidents: Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time, Equipment – a military style report to sum up what you see succinctly).
