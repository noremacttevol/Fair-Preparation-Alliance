This is contrary to many modern orgs that treat print as an afterthought. We even prioritize _low-tech design_: high-contrast, easily readable fonts (to be visible by flashlight or in low light), minimal reliance on color (in case of black-and-white copies), and standardized sizes (like all brochures formatted for A4/Letter).

The result: when digital goes dark, our communications don’t collapse – they simply **fall back to paper**. The community is already holding our messages in their hands or on their shelves. This approach harks back to older civil defense strategies (like distributing
