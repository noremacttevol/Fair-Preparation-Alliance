**Description:** Become a member of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (**VOAD**) network and actively engage in multi-organization planning and exercises. National VOAD is an umbrella that brings together dozens of nonprofits and faith-based groups in disasters. FPA’s involvement will formalize our place among recognized responders and open doors for coordination and resource sharing. This milestone also includes running joint drills with a mix of agencies and NGOs, to practice unified response scenarios (FPA squads working alongside Red Cross, state officials, etc.).
**Real-World Example:** FPA’s application to National VOAD was approved in 2025, making us one of the newer members alongside groups like United Way and Habitat for Humanity. Shortly after, FPA participated in a large-scale hurricane response exercise in Florida involving VOAD partners: our role was to simulate community-led search and communications while other NGOs ran shelters and food distribution. The exercise revealed friction points (like radio frequency conflicts and overlap in outreach efforts) which were then resolved in a post-drill meeting. By the next real hurricane, those issues were ironed out, and FPA was included in the state’s coordination calls as an equal player.
