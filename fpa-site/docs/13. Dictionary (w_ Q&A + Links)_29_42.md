Q43: How do I manage sanitation (toilets, waste) if services break down?
A: Sanitation is critical – poor waste management can make you very sick. If plumbing or sewers aren’t working, plan for a safe way to handle human waste. A common method is to use a sturdy bucket as a temporary toilet, lined with heavy-duty trash bags. After each use, add something like cat litter, sawdust, or a splash of bleach to cover waste and reduce odor. When a bag is full, tie it off and store it outside (away from your living area) until you can dispose of it. If you’re in a remote area, you can bury waste in a cathole (6–8 inches deep, 200 feet from water sources). Also manage regular garbage: seal food scraps and trash in bags or containers to keep pests away. Keep cleanup supplies on hand – soap, hand sanitizer, bleach, and gloves – to maintain hygiene and prevent disease. [#Beginner] [#Health]
