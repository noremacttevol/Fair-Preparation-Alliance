One of FPA’s defining operational principles is that members come to each other’s aid during emergencies – effectively forming a mutual aid network. Mutual aid means that rather than each member only fending for themselves, they pool efforts and resources to ensure everyone’s safety and well-being. In practice, this takes several forms: Rescue and Evacuation Help: If a member (or their family) is in danger and needs help evacuating, other nearby members will assist. For example, if a member’s vehicle breaks down during an evacuation, another member will pick them up. Or if someone is trapped (e.g., by debris after a quake), members with skills in rescue or equipment (like chainsaws, ropes) will attempt to rescue them if it’s safe to do so, rather than waiting for outside rescue that might never come. Sharing Shelter: Members whose homes are safer or unaffected will host those who had to flee. It might mean multiple families bunking in one house or setting up a group tent camp on someone’s land. This is pre-arranged to some extent (members know which homes are potential group shelters – often the ones designated as rally points or safehouses in plans). They also discuss things like sleeping arrangements, privacy considerations, and pet accommodations ahead of time to reduce friction when it happens. Resource Pooling: As detailed in [[Resource Management and Logistics]], mutual aid means no one goes hungry or without critical supplies if another member has extra. If one
