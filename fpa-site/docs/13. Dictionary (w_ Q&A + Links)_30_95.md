A: The Fair Protection Alliance app (likely a digital tool referenced in the files) serves as a modern aid for FPA members, consolidating communication, resources, and planning features in one place. Functions it might have include: a secure messaging system or forum for members to discuss and alert each other (almost like a Slack/Discord but for FPA), event schedules for trainings or meetups, and a library section that could house the digital knowledge base (Compass Guide, Q&A dictionary) for quick reference. The app might also have checklists that members can mark off (like “Beginner Tier: did you store 3 days of water? Check.”) and it tracks their progress through the ORP levels. For emergency use, perhaps it can push notifications about regional disasters or warnings (pulling from weather alerts or member reports). Another feature could be a map with member-shared resources (like locations of group caches or rally points, though likely with access controls). Given AI involvement in some documents, the app might have an AI chatbot to answer common prepping questions using the FPA knowledge base. Privacy is key, so it likely has strong encryption and login credentials – maybe only for verified members. It’s meant to complement, not replace, offline skills: the app is great while internet works, but FPA emphasizes having all the info offline too. However, in normal times it greatly eases coordination across the alliance’s widespread community, especially for younger or more
