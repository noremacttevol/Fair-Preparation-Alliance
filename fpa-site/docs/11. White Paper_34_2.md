- Involve external experts (from academia, agencies) for fresh insights, but keep the tone practical and peer-to-peer – this isn’t a lecture circuit, it’s doers teaching doers.
**Contingency Plan:** If international travel is not feasible (due to pandemics, political climate, etc.), pivot to a fully virtual summit using video links and real-time translation – and complement with many regional meetups that connect digitally. In case a planned host country faces a disaster at the time (ironically possible), be ready to relocate or delay rather than cancel – or turn the summit into a relief effort if appropriate. Maintain flexibility: the summit’s value is content and connection, not a fixed format. If costs become too high, scale down frequency or form regional mini-summits that then share outcomes globally. The spirit is that learning and camaraderie must continue, whatever the format.  
_(The roadmap continues through additional milestones focusing on global Outernet coverage, multilingual content, cross-border aid protocols, global resource pooling, political neutrality, public outreach, volunteer well-being, cutting-edge decentralized technologies, and ultimately achieving a fully self-sustaining international network. These steps ensure that by the end of Phase 3, the FPA is not only nationwide but worldwide, bonded by trust and capable of weathering any crisis.)_
