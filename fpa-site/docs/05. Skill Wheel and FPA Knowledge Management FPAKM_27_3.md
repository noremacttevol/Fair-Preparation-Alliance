In providing this detailed plan, we’ve created a blueprint to build the system in alignment with FPA’s Mk1Mod3 program and ethical framework. The next steps after this plan would be to develop prototypes (both of the visual aspects and the database/app backend), test them with a pilot group, and gather feedback for refinement. From there, we implement Phase1 officially, then Phase2, and so on, with continuous improvements at each stage.  
With diligent implementation and adherence to our principles, the FPA Skill Wheel will become more than just a visual dashboard – it will be a **compass** that points each member toward greater preparedness. It will transform abstract goals (like “be better prepared”) into visible, trackable progress, making the formidable task of disaster readiness feel tangible and achievable. Yet it will also constantly remind us that it’s a journey without end – there is no 100%, no finish line, only continual improvement. In a world of growing uncertainties, this system will help ensure that FPA members stay **ready, realistic, and resilient**, learning and adapting together, no matter what challenges lie ahead.
