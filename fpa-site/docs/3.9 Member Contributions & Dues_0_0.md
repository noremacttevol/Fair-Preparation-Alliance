FPA thrives on the contributions of its members, though it typically avoids formal dues to keep membership accessible. Contributions come in various forms:  
- Time and Skills: Volunteering to lead a training, organizing a gear maintenance day, or serving on the coordinating council.  
- Knowledge Sharing: Contributing to the knowledge vault ([[7.2 FPA Knowledge Vault]]) by writing notes or guides.  
- Resource Sharing: Donating or lending equipment to communal caches or to members in need (following the ethos that no member should be left under-equipped).
In some cases, a chapter might have a small membership fee or pooled fund for group expenses (like renting a training venue or purchasing shared radio gear), but this is decided collectively. The emphasis is on fair contribution: everyone gives what they can, whether itâ€™s expertise, labor, or a spare tent, ensuring the alliance remains well-resourced and fair.
