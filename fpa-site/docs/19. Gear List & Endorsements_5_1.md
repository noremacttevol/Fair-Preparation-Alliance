- **Controlled Gear Samples and Trials:** Vendors may offer free samples of gear for us to test – this can be helpful so members don’t have to buy expensive items out-of-pocket. However, all such instances are **fully transparent**: the sample is logged in our vendor interaction log (with date, who provided it, and who received it for testing). Testers of vendor-provided samples are required to follow the same audit checklist and **report even more rigorously**, knowing skepticism is warranted. The source of the sample is disclosed in the final report. A free sample **never guarantees a favorable outcome** – many times, provided samples have led us to uncover flaws that a regular consumer wouldn’t find until too late. We make that risk clear to vendors: by giving us a sample, they accept that we will publish whatever we find, good or bad.
