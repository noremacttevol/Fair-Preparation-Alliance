Honesty with Empathy: We teach that honesty must be coupled with kindness. The phrase “brutal honesty” is not our goal; instead, caring honesty is our approach. This means telling the truth in a way that respects the person. For example, instead of “Your idea is bad and you caused this project to fail,” one might say “I’m concerned that the approach we took didn’t work out; I have some thoughts on why and I’d like to hear yours so we can do better.” This way, the truth of the matter is confronted, but without personal attack. We provide training in communication techniques like using “I” statements (“I felt X when Y happened”) and separating behavior from identity (“That action didn’t meet our standards” rather than “You failed”). In an honest culture, feedback is frequent and normalized, both positive and critical. We encourage teams to have regular feedback loops where colleagues tell each other one thing they appreciate and one thing to improve – making it routine takes the sting out of it and prevents small issues from accumulating.  
Rationale: A culture of honesty and transparency directly counteracts the common failure modes of denial and cover-up that have sunk many organizations. History shows that when issues are hidden to save face, they eventually explode. FPA chooses the route of sunlight and open dialogue to maintain integrity. We expect that over the decades, this will earn us a reputation for candor and trustworthiness, both internally and externally.
