**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** The next phase focuses on **expanding reach and interactivity**. Planned in the coming month: (a) Distribute **low-cost radio receivers** to members who need them – we bulk-ordered hand-crank radios; within 30 days we want at least 200 distributed to ensure every member has access to broadcasts. (b) Start a **two-way segment** in the broadcast: allocate time for live call-ins or radio check-ins from chapters (scheduled via HAM nets). This will transform some broadcasts into a dialogue rather than monologue, further engaging members. (c) Build a content archive – we’ll compile the best segments into an “Offgrid Audio Library” (downloadable packs that members can keep on USB or phones for reference). In the next month, we’ll also test **text-data broadcasting** via radio (like short text bursts or images encoded in radio signals) to send written updates or even PDFs from the knowledge base – an experimental effort to broaden Outernet’s capabilities. We aim to add at least 5 new local podcast loops from different chapters in the next 30 days to ensure variety and representation. By month’s end, our goal is an Outernet broadcast that any member in the country can reliably access, delivering both vital info and a sense of community connection, internet or not.
