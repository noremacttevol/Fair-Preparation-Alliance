- **On-the-Fly Problem Solving:** A squad’s radio setup isn’t working. They ask the AI, describing their antenna configuration. Drawing on its technical data, it suggests checking the coax cable connection and testing another frequency (perhaps a known issue with that radio model). Essentially, it provides tech support when no expert is available, often resolving issues faster.  
- **Community Guidance:** During a power outage, rumors spread about water contamination. The squad leader uses the app to send a factual update (from FPA’s verified info) to all members and neighbors on the mesh network, quelling panic. If someone queries the AI about “boiling water advisory steps,” it gives the proper procedure. This shows how tech helps maintain calm and knowledge sharing.
