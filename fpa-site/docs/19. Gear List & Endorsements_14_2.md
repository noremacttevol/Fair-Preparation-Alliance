- **Offline Resilience System:** The strategies and tools FPA uses to ensure operations and knowledge-sharing can continue without internet or power. It includes the use of printed materials (like this binder), local radio communications, in-person meetups, and data backups on durable media. The gear endorsement program is part of this system by producing offline-friendly outputs (field cards, printed manuals, etc.).  
- **SHTF Bible:** An informal name for FPA’s comprehensive guide to disaster scenarios and preparedness (“When **S**hit **H**its **T**he **F**an” Bible). It outlines various crisis situations (natural disasters, grid-down scenarios, societal breakdowns, etc.) and the recommended preparations for each. Gear endorsements are often cross-referenced with the SHTF Bible to ensure we have approved solutions for key needs in those scenarios. For example, the SHTF Bible might say “clean water is priority in hurricanes” and our gear list ensures we have endorsed filters to match that need.  
- **Vendor Transparency Log:** A record (maintained by FPA) of all communications and interactions with gear vendors. It exists to ensure any information exchange or influence is documented. Members can review this log to see if, for example, a company provided test samples or was notified of a problem. It is part of our firewall system.
