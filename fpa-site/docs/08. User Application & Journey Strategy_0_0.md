FPA User Application & Journey Strategy based on MK1MOD3 standards will:  
- Expand the original document with deeper structure drawn from your files.  
- Include clear Obsidian-style internal links (e.g., [[Compass Guide]], [[Application System]], [[User Journey Maps]]).  
- Focus Phase 1 (Grassroots, Manual) as the priority for immediate developer action, while Phase 2 and Phase 3 (AI-driven future) will be scoped philosophically for long-term roadmap alignment.  
- Group content logically to make linking easy later.  
- Keep it strategic, concise, but deeply thought-out for dev-readiness.
