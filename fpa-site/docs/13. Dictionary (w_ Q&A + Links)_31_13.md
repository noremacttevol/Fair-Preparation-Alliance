is left alone. Another ultimate goal might be educating the next generation – making preparedness and civic duty part of basic education, so the legacy continues. If we think cynically, an “endgame” could also be ensuring that if worst-case events happen, at least the FPA communities survive and can be seeds of recovery. But they wouldn’t state it as an elitist lifeboat; it’s more altruistic: be the vessel that carries forward knowledge, ethics, and hope through dark times. So beyond stocking beans and bandages, FPA’s vision is essentially nation-rebuilding at the community level, and a world where neighbors look out for each other, thereby reducing the impact of any crisis. They measure ultimate success not by never facing disaster, but by how society responds when it does – ideally with resilience, solidarity, and fairness, thanks in part to groundwork FPA laid.
