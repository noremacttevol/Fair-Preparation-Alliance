**Fallback Leadership Council:** If central comms never return, squads in a region should form a **council** and combine resources. Communication-wise, this could mean establishing a permanent open net with rotating net control among the squads (spreading the workload and giving rest). They might designate a common frequency where any urgent call will be heard by at least someone at any time – essentially a community watch on air. Those with stronger stations can take turns acting as repeater-like relays for those farther out. Over days/weeks, this council might establish a more robust local network – even constructing improvised repeaters from scavenged parts, or moving teams to high ground for signal relay. The doctrine cannot predict every adaptation, but by instilling the mindset of “link together, create a net, assign roles” we set the stage for those innovations.
