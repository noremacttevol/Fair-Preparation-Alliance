Q45: How can I prep effectively if I live in an apartment or small space?
A: Apartment prepping is doable; you just have to be smart with space and safety. Use every storage spot – closets, under beds, shelves – to tuck away supplies. You won’t fit a year of food, but you can manage several weeks’ worth by using stackable containers and creative use of space. Since you can’t run a gas generator (and open flames are risky indoors), lean on smaller solutions: a compact camping stove for cooking (only with good ventilation, like near an open window), and battery packs or a small power station to keep phones and essential devices charged. Plan your escape routes – know your building’s stairwells and exits in case you need to evacuate quickly. In short, prepping in an apartment is about maximizing space, using safe alternatives for power/cooking, and adapting to the constraints of city living. [#Beginner] [#Preparedness]
