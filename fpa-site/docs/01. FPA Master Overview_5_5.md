3. Membership keeps growing thanks to outreach. At 30,000 members, the system auto-adjusts dues to ~$3.33 each, still about $100k total. Members notice extra few bucks back in their pocket. We’re still funded nicely.  
4. We reach 60,000 members in Phase3. Dues are now ~$1.67 each, $100k total. We find that expenses are around $90k; we’re saving $10k a month to the emergency fund even at this low per-head rate.  
5. Leadership says: “We consistently have excess, and each member’s paying less than $2 now. Let’s consider dropping dues to zero and run on our reserves + donations for a while.” A vote is held, and 85% vote **Yes** to eliminate dues. From next month, membership is free. We continue operations using stored funds and voluntary donations.  
6. A year later, a huge coordinated drill or a real SHTF event uses up a lot of resources. Leadership proposes reinstating a $1/month due for six months to rebuild caches. Members discuss and approve it, knowing exactly why it’s needed. After six months, it sunsets back to $0.
