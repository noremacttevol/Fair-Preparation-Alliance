- Cooking & Heating: If power and gas go out, how to cook? Solutions include a camp stove with plenty of fuel (used outdoors or with ventilation), a rocket stove, or a barbecue grill (and charcoal/propane). For indoor heating in winter, if you have a fireplace or wood stove, stock wood; otherwise, safe indoor heaters (like certain propane heaters rated for indoor use with ventilation) can be life savers. Even terracotta pot candles can provide a bit of warmth. Store fuel safely and have a carbon monoxide detector as a precaution.  
- Lighting & Power: Keep multiple flashlights and lanterns with extra batteries, and perhaps solar garden lights that charge outside by day and can be brought in at night. Candles and oil lamps are backups (with care for fire safety). For power, a home battery bank or generator can keep critical devices running â€“ ensure fuel for the generator or a way to recharge batteries (solar panels on hand, hand-crank chargers). A small inverter can turn car battery power into AC for small appliances in a pinch.  
- Sanitation: If water service is disrupted, have buckets, plastic liners, and a makeshift toilet solution (like a Luggable Loo seat for a 5-gallon bucket) plus lots of garbage bags. Store extra hygiene items: soap, hand sanitizer, bleach, trash bags, toilet paper, feminine hygiene, diapers if needed, and lime or bleach to treat human waste if sewage lines back up.
