Dispute Resolution: In any organization, conflicts happen. Governance & Oversight serves as a neutral party to resolve disputes that escalate beyond the squad or regional level. This could include mediating disagreements between content families (e.g., if Core and Tech conflict on data sharing, Governance helps broker a policy), or handling member grievances (if someone claims they were unfairly passed over for promotion, for instance). They ensure due process is followed. Members know they can appeal to this team if they feel wronged, and they’ll get a fair hearing guided by the Alliance’s rules and values. This prevents infighting and builds trust that problems can be solved internally without drama.  
External Legal Compliance: This team keeps FPA’s operations on the right side of the law (to the extent possible while still preparing for worst-case scenarios). They monitor relevant laws – for example, regulations on ham radio use, drone operation, firearms, first aid practice, etc. – and ensure our training and operations don’t inadvertently encourage illegal activity. They likely liaise with legal counsel or knowledgeable members on issues like liability at events, data protection laws for our app, or maintaining our legal status. If we ever incorporate or partner with official agencies, Governance handles the paperwork and relationship management on the organizational side (while Comms would handle the PR side).
