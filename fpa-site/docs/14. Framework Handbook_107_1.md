As we look ahead, we plan to enhance this digital toolkit. Potential Mk1Mod4 ideas include better damage assessment tools (maybe utilizing the phone’s camera for AR guidance on structural safety) or more community engagement features (like gamified drills or scenario challenges to keep skills sharp). But all will be built on the foundation Mk1Mod3 laid: **augment human preparedness, don’t replace it, and design for offline resilience**.
