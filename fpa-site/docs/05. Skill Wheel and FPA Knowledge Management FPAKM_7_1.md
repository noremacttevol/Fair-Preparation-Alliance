We conceptually define **50%** as roughly _“likely to survive a moderate disaster if FPA is active and can assist.”_ In other words, a member at ~50% proficiency in most areas has solid basics and would likely pull through a crisis especially with community support, but might struggle in extreme scenarios without help. **75%** would mean _“very likely to survive in most disasters”_ – this member has a well-rounded and advanced skill set, potentially able to handle many emergencies solo and even lead others. Reaching ~75% in all categories is a major achievement, marking a veteran member; still, it’s not an absolute guarantee because there could always be scenarios that overwhelm even a well-prepared individual. **100%**, as noted, is intentionally **unattainable** – no one can be fully prepared for _everything_. The system will never actually display “100%” even if a member checks every box; practically, it might cap at 99%. This ceiling is a deliberate reminder of humility: it echoes the [[Trust Doctrine]] emphasis on honesty (no false certainty). There’s always some scenario or extreme condition that could challenge even the best-prepared person. By never showing 100%, the system subtly reminds members that there is no such thing as total invincibility. The goal is _continuous improvement_, not an end point.
