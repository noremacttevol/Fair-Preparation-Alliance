FPA strives to be an alliance by the members as much as for the members. Participation in governance means that regular members have avenues to influence policies, contribute ideas, and have a say in how the Alliance evolves. One mechanism for this is the advisory committees or working groups that include non-leadership members; for example, an AI advisory group was formed when developing the [[AI Oversight and Ethics Guidelines]], which included tech-savvy members who were not on the main council, ensuring broad input. Similarly, when updating the gear recommendations, members who are experts in various fields (medical, mechanics, etc.) convene to update the [[Approved Gear List Overview]] and those recommendations are funneled up to leadership for endorsement. Many decisions are floated to the community for discussion first. FPA often uses the Realnet forums or secure group chats to post proposals (e.g., “Should we establish a new chapter in X region?” or “Proposal: adopt encryption protocol Y for our communications – feedback welcome.”). Members can comment, ask questions, or voice concerns. The leadership takes this feedback seriously and often adjusts plans accordingly. In local chapters, participation is even more direct: most chapters hold regular meetings where any member can raise issues or suggestions – these might be about schedule changes, new training ideas, or community outreach opportunities. Some chapters implement a simple voting process for local decisions
