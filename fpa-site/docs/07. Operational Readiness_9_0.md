All members of rank **E-3 and above** must regularly complete a set of drills to validate their readiness. These are not one-time trainings, but ongoing requirements that ensure skills don’t atrophy:  
- **Dark Drill:** At least 12–24 hours of operating **using radio-only comms** (no phones or internet). This drill tests everyone’s ability to coordinate when the grid is down and builds confidence in HAM/VHF usage.  
- **Print Drill:** A full refresh of offline materials – printing out the latest SOPs, checklists, contact lists, etc., and distributing them to the team. This ensures all printed backups are up-to-date and that members practice relying on paper.  
- **Task Drill:** A simulation where the digital tasking system is turned off. Leaders issue physical task cards and possibly simulate a “node failure” (e.g. assume the squad lead is unavailable) to practice distributed leadership and adaptability.  
Drill participation is logged in both the FPA app (when online) and in the squad’s paper binder. Completing these drills is **mandatory** for maintaining rank status. Members who miss a required drill will be flagged – they must complete a makeup drill or undergo re-certification at the squad level before their rank is considered in good standing again. These drills serve as a continuous feedback loop: consistent participation boosts a member’s trust and competency rating, while lapses prompt corrective training and can hinder one’s progression.
