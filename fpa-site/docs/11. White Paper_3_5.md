_Lessons learned:_ A consistent lesson from both drills and disasters is **“your plan is only as good as the last time you drilled it.”** People often overestimate what they can do under stress. For instance, during a 2022 FPA-wide “Grid Down Weekend” drill, we learned that **60% of participants ran out of either water or food by day 3** (despite many thinking they had a week’s supply). Plans also tend to overlook contingencies: what if your primary evacuation road is impassable, or what if an injury or illness strikes in the middle of a crisis? The Test My Plan tool – supported by our FPAi Chatbot – systematically throws common failure points at you (e.g., “What if your car won’t start? What if the emergency happens at night when your family is separated?”). **Lesson:** Taking this seriously saves lives. As blunt truth, **a plan untested is barely a plan.** We’ve also learned to incorporate neighbors or family into these tests: one member discovered his family had very different ideas of what to do in a fire. That hard conversation only happened because the structured review forced it. Going forward, every member needs to treat their personal plan as a living document too – updating it annually or after any major life change.
