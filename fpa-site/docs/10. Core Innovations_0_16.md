**Links to FPA Resources:** The live **Approved Gear List** is on our website’s member section (updated monthly) ([Approved Gear List — Fair Preparation Alliance](https://www.fairpreparationalliance.com/approved-gear-list#:~:text=Approved%20Gear%20List)) ([Build A Kit | Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/kit#:~:text=After%20an%20emergency%2C%20you%20may,the%20event%20of%20an%20emergency)). The **Compass Guide** principle of _“Quality and Fairness”_ in preparedness purchases guided this effort【CompassGuide†L40-L46】. Refer to the **Dictionary** entries for certain gear terms (e.g., “Faraday bag” or “IFAK” – Individual First Aid Kit) for definitions used in our evaluations. Also, an upcoming **Gear Endorsement SOP** will detail how items are tested and approved, aligning with our Trust Doctrine stance against bias or commercial influence【TrustDoctrine†L18-L22】.
