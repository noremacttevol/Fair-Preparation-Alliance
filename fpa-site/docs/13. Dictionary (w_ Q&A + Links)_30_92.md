A: Beyond basic first aid, FPA encourages members to pursue advanced medical skills to handle austere or prolonged crises. This might involve partnering with organizations that teach Wilderness First Responder courses, CERT medical training, or even EMT certifications for those willing. They host advanced workshops: perhaps trauma care (control severe bleeding with tourniquets, treat gunshot or shrapnel wounds), extended care (how to care for a sick/injured person when hospitals are not reachable for days/weeks), and common emergency procedures (like splinting fractures, recognizing dehydration and doing field rehydration). Some medically experienced members (doctors, nurses, combat medics) might train others in things like suturing wounds (maybe using pigs’ feet for practice) or basic diagnostic signs (taking blood pressure, checking for infection). The alliance likely compiles a list of what each member’s medical skills are and what gear they have (who owns an AED, who has a comprehensive trauma kit, etc.), so they know who to turn to. They also address the medical supply side: teaching how to improvise (using clean cloth for bandages, making oral rehydration solution from salt, sugar, water if needed, etc.), and encouraging stockpiling of extra prescriptions, antibiotics (if they can get them or alternatives like fish antibiotics – though that’s debated), and over-the-counter meds. For really advanced scenarios, some FPA materials might cover minor surgical interventions
