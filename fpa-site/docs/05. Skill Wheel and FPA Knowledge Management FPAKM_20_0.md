**Scope:** In Phase2, we build out the technical infrastructure to support the Skill Wheel and start integrating it with other FPA systems. This is where the project shifts from a manually maintained idea to a dynamic software-supported platform.  
- **App Integration:** The FPA mobile app will be updated to include a **Skill Wheel module**. Members will be able to log in and see an up-to-date visualization of their Skill Wheel on their dashboard. This will likely be one of the first things they see upon opening the app (e.g., “Welcome [Call Sign], here is your current Skill Wheel.”). Members will also be able to take quizzes directly in the app. Upon completing a quiz, the system will automatically update their corresponding segment. We’ll implement push notifications to gently nudge behavior (for example, “📋 Your Navigation skill is a bit low – consider taking the Land Nav quiz or attending a map-reading workshop.”).  
- **Database-Backed System:** Behind the scenes, we’ll move from spreadsheets or manual records to a proper database. Each member’s skills, training activities, and achievements will be stored in a centralized system. Instructors and authorized volunteers will have accounts to input data (like drill results) directly. This removes the bottleneck of a single admin updating everyone’s profile. It also opens the door for more advanced data analysis and tracking.
