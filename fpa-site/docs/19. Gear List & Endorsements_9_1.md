- **No Panic-Bait Language or Fearmongering:** FPA communications about gear (and in general) must remain factual, clear, and level-headed. We strictly avoid and discourage “panic-bait” language – sensational claims like “Buy this or your family will die in the next disaster!” or any phrasing that exaggerates the urgency beyond what the facts support. Preparedness is serious, and there is urgency in being equipped, but we will not exploit emotions to drive sales or engagement. Endorsement write-ups and discussions focus on **practical benefits and limitations** of gear, not wild worst-case hyperbole. This rule also applies to vendors who want to use our endorsements – if a company were to market an FPA-endorsed product by saying “FPA says this gadget will save you from the apocalypse, act now or else,” we would intervene and consider it a misuse of our name. Our philosophy is that rational, informed decision-making beats fear-driven impulse buying every time. Keeping language calm and truthful leads to better preparedness, not prepper fatigue or irrational hoarding.
