**Description:** Clearly establish and document the expanded FPA rank and governance structure to support the now-national organization. This includes defining responsibilities from **O1** through **O10** officer ranks (e.g., squad leaders, regional coordinators, national council members) and introducing a custom **E-10** rank to honor top-tier field experts who aren’t in formal leadership. By having a transparent rank system, FPA can maintain order and clarity as it grows, ensuring everyone knows who’s coordinating what without creating a rigid hierarchy. This milestone translates the informal leadership that emerged in Phase 2 into a codified system for Phase 3.
**Real-World Example:** In 2026, the FPA National Council ratified a Rank Charter. For instance, they defined **O-3** as a Squad Leader, **O-5** as a Regional Coordinator, **O-8** as a National Council officer, and **O-10** as the nominal head of FPA (though as a council chair, not a dictator). Meanwhile, veteran volunteers who wanted to remain “in the field” could be recognized as **E-10 Master Responders**, signaling decades of experience. This structure was put to the test during a multi-state wildfire: Region 9’s Coordinator (an O-5) coordinated efforts across squads, while an O-8 National Operations officer facilitated resources between regions. Everyone from new recruits to outside agencies could see the chain of coordination, yet decisions still flowed from the ground up per the Trust Doctrine.
