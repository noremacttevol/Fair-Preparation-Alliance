A: FPA treats breaches of trust seriously, as they threaten the integrity and safety of the group. When a member violates key rules (like stealing community resources, exposing another member’s OPSEC info, or otherwise acting unethically), the first step is likely an inquiry by respected members or a council. They’d gather facts: maybe talk to witnesses, the people involved, etc. Minor issues might be addressed with a direct talk and warning – FPA believes in second chances if the person shows remorse and fixes the behavior. For example, if someone was just careless (accidentally mentioned something they shouldn’t have), they might get a stern reminder and perhaps extra OPSEC training. For more serious breaches – deliberate harm or betrayal – FPA can revoke membership. Essentially, excommunication from the alliance is the ultimate consequence: the person is removed from group communications and activities, and other members are warned not to engage in planning with them. In high-trust groups, social consequences like ostracism are powerful. They might also quietly spread word to other prepper networks to beware of that individual if the breach was really bad (like theft or scam). If any laws were broken (say theft or violence), FPA wouldn’t shield the person; they’d cooperate with authorities or at least not obstruct justice. Importantly, FPA’s internal culture is such that members policing each other usually prevents breaches from getting far – small frictions are resolved
