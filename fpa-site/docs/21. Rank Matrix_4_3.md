- **E-10 (Master):** Achieve the capstone of the core path by orchestrating a large-scale event and demonstrating complete mastery. E-10 requires you to **organize and lead a major emergency preparedness exercise** that involves either the public or multiple regional teams. For example, you might coordinate a city-wide blackout drill in cooperation with local CERT teams or host a public disaster-preparedness fair and simulation. This event tests your ability to plan logistics, manage large groups, liaise with external organizations, and showcase the Alliance’s capabilities openly. Reaching E-10 “Master” means you have earned the full confidence of the Alliance: you’ve mastered personal and technical skills and have proven leadership and outreach abilities. _(AP: points for scale of event, number of participants, and impact; validation for Master typically involves Alliance leadership confirming you have met all criteria.)_
