**Why it was created (problem it solves):** _Squads are the heart of FPA’s on-ground operations_, but as membership grew, some squads ended up too small, too large, or imbalanced, and coordination tools were lacking. We had cases of “stranded” small groups not collaborating and large unwieldy groups where members felt lost. The **merge-logic** addresses the **problem of suboptimal team sizes and distribution**. It ensures that power in numbers is utilized by merging nearby small teams, and that overly large teams can be organized for efficiency. The Squad Tools solve the everyday **coordination problem** – squads needed better ways to share information and to function as a unit beyond occasional meetups. With these tools, a squad can operate like a tight-knit unit, sharing intel quickly and responding to emergencies collectively. Additionally, by formalizing how squads form or merge, we maintain effectiveness as we expand, rather than leaving it to chance. _Flexibility in organizational structure is vital; just as ICS can expand or contract as needed ([emilms.fema.gov](https://emilms.fema.gov/is_0200c/groups/471.html#:~:text=A%C2%A0guiding%20principle%20of%C2%A0NIMS%20is%20flexibility,capable%20of%20handling%20catastrophic%20events)), our squads can merge or split to meet the preparedness mission._ This innovation brings that adaptive principle into FPA’s community context.
