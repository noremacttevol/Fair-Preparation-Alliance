Q10: What is an EDC kit and how is it different from a BOB?
A: An Everyday Carry (EDC) kit is the collection of essential items you keep on your person day in and day out. It’s the gear you can’t afford to be without in an emergency because you’ll likely have it with you at all times (in your pockets, on a belt, or in a small bag). An EDC kit typically includes practical tools for daily survival: things like a pocket knife or multi-tool, a flashlight, a lighter or fire starter, a small first aid kit or trauma item (tourniquet), and often a reliable means of communication (phone or radio) and a backup battery. Even simple items like a whistle, pen, and notepad can be part of EDC. The idea is to be prepared for common problems or sudden crises wherever you go, without lugging around a full bug-out bag.
