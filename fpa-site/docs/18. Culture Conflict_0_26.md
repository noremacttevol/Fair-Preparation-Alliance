The “Pause Protocol”: A unique protective measure in FPA is the Pause Protocol, which is essentially an emergency brake for conflict. Pause Protocol means any member has the authority to call a temporary halt to an ongoing process, project, or decision if they believe a serious conflict or ethical issue requires immediate attention. For example, if during a project meeting a heated argument breaks out and accusations of misconduct fly, a team member can invoke a “Pause.” When a Pause is called, the related activity is put on hold and a formal conflict resolution is initiated before work resumes. The purpose is to ensure we don’t simply plow forward amid dysfunction, and that we address the root issues first. The rules for Pause Protocol are: it should be used judiciously (for significant issues, not trivial disagreements), the person invoking it must immediately notify a responsible facilitator (such as the squad lead or Trust Liaison) who will then organize a mediation or problem-solving session, and there is a defined timeline (e.g. within 48 hours a meeting must occur) so that the pause leads to action, not stagnation. The pause can be lifted only once the conflict has been addressed to the satisfaction of the relevant parties or moved into a formal resolution path. Example: Two teams are about to deploy a joint initiative, but a dispute over data privacy arises with some members feeling the plan violates our ethics. An engineer calls a Pause on the deployment.
