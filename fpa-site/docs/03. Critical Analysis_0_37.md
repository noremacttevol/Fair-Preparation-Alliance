Scaling and Structure: Assuming initial growth, how to scale? FPA would benefit from a federated structure – local autonomy but under a shared banner and standards. It could implement a chapter system (like how CERT has local programs, or how the Red Cross has local chapters). Each FPA chapter could sign a charter agreeing to core principles and be free to adapt to local needs beyond that. A national (or international) coordinating body can handle large-scale initiatives, partnerships, and knowledge sharing. Over time, a formal membership model may emerge (with dues funding the operations, in exchange for training and resources – as long as dues are modest to keep it inclusive). Feasibility here will depend on demonstrating value to members. If paying, say, $5 a month ensures your community has an emergency cache or gets expert workshops, many might find it worthwhile. This could be the route to financial sustainability, supplementing grants or donations.  
In summary, FPA’s viability looks plausible given contemporary trends, but it hinges on smart positioning and tangible results. By rebranding preparedness as a positive, collective endeavor, forging strategic partnerships, and proving itself through early successes, FPA can journey from the fringe into the mainstream consciousness. Each step of adoption will need trust-building – with the public, with officials, and among members – but if done right, FPA could evolve into a respected pillar of community resilience.
