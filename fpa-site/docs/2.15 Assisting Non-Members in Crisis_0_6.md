Community Relief Efforts: If broader community relief efforts are organized (by local churches, CERT teams, Red Cross, etc.), FPA members may choose to participate as individuals. For example, they might volunteer at a public soup kitchen or distribution center, contributing labor or know-how (without necessarily divulging their group ties). This way, FPA indirectly helps more people and can also stay informed about the crisis response, all while blending in. Theyâ€™ll be cautious not to drain their own critical reserves through these efforts, contributing only what they can spare.  
Security Concerns: In chaotic crises, offering help can sometimes attract unwanted attention. FPA is wary of traps (a plea for help that lures people into an ambush) or of being overwhelmed by a mob if word spreads that they have supplies. Therefore, any aid given is usually low-key and not publicized. Members communicate if they notice large groups of refugees or looters in an area, and FPA may temporarily suspend aiding outsiders if it endangers the group. They will never compromise a critical group mission (like evacuating a member or protecting a cache) by stopping for unrelated outsiders, unless lives are immediately at stake and intervention is feasible.
