Process 2: Escalation Pathways Across Circles  
This process addresses conflicts that either involve multiple squads/circles or could not be settled within one circleâ€™s scope. Escalation is designed to provide increasing levels of perspective and authority to solve problems that are beyond the reach of a single team, while still preserving fairness and the opportunity for those directly involved to resolve the issue collaboratively.
