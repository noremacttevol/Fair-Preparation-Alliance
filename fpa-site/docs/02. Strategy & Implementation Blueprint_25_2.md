- **Firewall Between Powers:** Interestingly, the Tribunal also acts as a **firewall between different powers** within FPA. By design, operational leaders (who run squads or initiatives) are mostly separate from the Tribunal members, to avoid conflict of interest. A squad leader shouldn’t sit in judgment of themselves or their immediate peers. The Tribunal is somewhat removed, providing a check. However, Tribunal members also must stay in touch with ground reality, so they often rotate attending drills or talking to squads to understand issues – but as observers, not commanders.  
- **Transparency of Tribunal:** In line with overall transparency, the Tribunal’s workings are as open as possible. Non-confidential hearings might be accessible for members to watch or read transcripts. Decisions are published with reasoning (again, akin to a court publishing opinions). If a decision has to be confidential (say it involves personal trauma of a member), the Tribunal may release a summary that protects identities but still accounts for its action to the community.
