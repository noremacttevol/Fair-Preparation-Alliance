- **Bulk Negotiation and Group Buys:** One of the advantages of being an alliance is our strength in numbers. When a particular endorsed item is in high demand among members, we organize **bulk purchases** or group buys. Our procurement team (or a volunteer squad) will approach the manufacturer or authorized dealer to negotiate a bulk rate. Often, we can secure significantly lower prices by agreeing to buy, say, 100 water filters at once. Those savings are passed to members who commit to the group buy – typically through our platform with full transparency (“Vendor X wholesale price = $20 each if 100+ units, plus shipping, no markup”). This not only saves money for individuals but can also foster a good relationship with vendors (ethical ones who are happy to support the community). We also coordinate timing to avoid crunches – for instance, scheduling bulk orders in the off-season before hurricane season drives up demand. **Economics of Scale:** By consolidating orders, we reduce per-unit shipping and handling costs as well. Members may pool not just money but also distribution efforts (local squads might receive a batch and then distribute items at meet-ups). All of this is done under Alliance oversight to ensure fairness in who gets the deal and that no one is reselling for profit.
