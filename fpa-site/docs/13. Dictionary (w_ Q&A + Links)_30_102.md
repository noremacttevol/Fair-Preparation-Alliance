for our situation or can a few tin cans on a tripwire suffice? “Practical Tactical” can be a mindset: always ask, does this action or setup make sense for us, will it reliably help achieve safety or our goal, and can we actually pull it off under stress? If not, find something that will. It’s a response to some prepper communities that fetishize high-speed tactical gear and techniques without context – FPA would rather have you master how to use a flashlight and firearm together effectively (practical) than have night vision goggles you don’t really know how to employ (impractical for most). Ultimately, it’s about being grounded: adapting professional or theoretical tactics into simplified, doable ones that normal people can execute when things go bad, thereby maximizing survival and mission success.
