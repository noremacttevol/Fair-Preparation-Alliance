Outlawing or Restrictions: In extreme future scenarios, if society becomes more authoritarian due to crises, independent networks like FPA might be outlawed or curtailed. This happened in some historical contexts where regimes didn’t allow independent civil society groups. While not an immediate concern in open societies, FPA should be mindful to keep a low political profile and highlight its public service nature to avoid such a fate. If, however, FPA were seen as an embryo of parallel governance (for instance, if in a major breakdown FPA essentially runs a locality in lieu of collapsed authorities), future governments might react by banning it once they regain control. The threat of being “too successful” in autonomy is a paradoxical one – FPA might reassure authorities by demonstrating willingness to integrate into official recovery efforts rather than replace them.
