- Back up important info in multiple forms: the cloud is great until internet is out; paper is reliable but can burn. Use both. For instance, store digital files of contacts on a USB drive in the go-box, and also have a laminated phone tree list physically there. Redundancy counts.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If using someone’s private property, ensure there’s a clear understanding of access (Do all members have a key? Only leaders?). Have a secondary site in mind if the primary is inaccessible (e.g., if the café is itself damaged in a quake). In case of eviction from a space, keep your materials portable so relocating is easy. If security of stored items is a concern (theft, etc.), keep only low-value but useful items at the base, and have members individually hold more valuable gear at their homes. Ultimately, the “base” concept is flexible – the key is the squad knows how to quickly regroup and access shared resources, rather than every person fending for themselves in chaos.
