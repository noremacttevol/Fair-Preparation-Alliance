- **Accessibility:** Every action in Phase 2 is designed with low-cost or no-cost alternatives so that even vulnerable members can participate and benefit. Key accessibility principles include:  
- _Financial Accessibility:_ Training is free or paid for by group funds; gear is provided via donations or creative sourcing. We explicitly avoid any requirement that members purchase expensive equipment – instead, the squad pools resources to equip everyone. For instance, if CERT requires a kit, the squad will collectively assemble kits from affordable components for those who can’t buy one. When pursuing technology (like Outernet or generators), we look for grants or community sponsorship so that cost is not a barrier to capability.  
- _Approachable Language:_ All documents, meeting discussions, and instructions use plain language. Jargon from the FPA Dictionary is explained in local languages/dialects as needed. If some members are not fluent in the primary language, translate crucial materials (perhaps using volunteers or simple online tools with bilingual members checking for accuracy). In disaster contexts, misunderstanding can be fatal – so the squad ensures everyone comprehends the plans regardless of education level or language barrier.
