**Description:** Forge a partnership with Community Emergency Response Teams (**CERT**) programs nationally to cross-train FPA members and standardize basic disaster response skills. Local FPA squads are encouraged to participate in CERT training sessions (and vice versa) to build common language and techniques with established community responders. This integration enhances FPA’s credibility and skill set by aligning with a well-known program, all while still maintaining FPA’s independent squad structure.
**Real-World Example:** In 2025, an FPA squad in Los Angeles partnered with the city’s CERT instructors to host a joint earthquake drill. FPA volunteers trained alongside neighborhood CERT members in light search and rescue and triage. Later that year, when a 6.0 quake struck, those FPA squad members knew exactly how to set up medical treatment areas and organize volunteers using CERT protocols, impressing local officials and seamlessly augmenting the official response.
