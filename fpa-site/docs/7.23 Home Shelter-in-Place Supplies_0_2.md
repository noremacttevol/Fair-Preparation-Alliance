- Medical: A well-rounded home first aid kit augmented with any prescription meds (with as much extra supply as you can rotate), OTC meds for common ailments, and perhaps a stock of antibiotics and reference on their use (if one chooses, some preppers get animal antibiotics as a backup). Don’t forget vitamins or specific dietary needs for long term health.  
- Communication & Information: A NOAA weather radio or hand-crank radio to get news. Whistles or signal panel to call for help if needed. If internet works, the knowledge vault is there; if not, physical books on first aid, repair, etc., are ready.  
- Security: Means to protect the home if law enforcement is stretched thin – this could be as simple as reinforcing doors/windows, having loud alarm whistles or air horn, pepper spray, or legally owned firearms if the household is trained and comfortable (FPA treats self-defense carefully, ensuring responsibility).  
- Comfort & Morale: Lastly, things that make staying home bearable: playing cards, board games, books, perhaps a musical instrument, art supplies, etc., especially where kids are involved## 7.24 Water Procurement & Purification Gear
