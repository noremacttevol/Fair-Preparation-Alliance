_Internal networks and external outreach channels for FPA._  
- [[4.1 - Realnet (Internal P2P Communications)]] – The Alliance’s peer-to-peer communication network connecting members. Describes how members stay in contact directly through radios, messengers, and offline channels – the **active internal comms layer** that remains operational even in grid-down situations.  
- [[4.2 - Outernet (External Media Outreach)]] – FPA’s outward-facing media layer for public communications. Covers how the Alliance broadcasts information to the outside world (e.g. social media, newsletters, or emergency broadcasts). **Outernet** is a Phase 3 initiative focused on outreach and influence beyond the core membership, distinguishing it from the internal Realnet.
