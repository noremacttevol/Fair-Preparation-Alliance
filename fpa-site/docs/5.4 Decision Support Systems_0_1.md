through the decision support system to learn and improve their own decision-making. Importantly, they also train when to disregard AI suggestions (for example, if the AI lacks fresh data on a local condition the humans directly see). This synergy allows quicker deliberation: the AI provides a distilled analysis in seconds, and the leadership can then apply context and judgment. The end result is often a more robust decision made in less time, a critical edge when minutes matter.
