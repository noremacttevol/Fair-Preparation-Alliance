- **Digital Presence & Content:** We maintain an active and strategic presence on major online platforms (website, social media, forums, etc.) to disseminate preparedness knowledge. However, unlike typical marketing, our content is not clickbait or superficial. We share substantive, actionable information: how-to videos on purifying water, infographics on building a “go-bag,” blog posts analyzing recent disasters’ lessons, etc. All digital content is created with our _print-first_ mindset (details on print-first are in a later section): for example, each infographic or guide is designed in a high-resolution format that can be downloaded as a PDF and printed by the user or by our teams for local distribution. When someone reads an FPA article online, we want them to visualize it easily fitting on a sheet of paper in their emergency binder. **SEO** and shareability are considered (we want people to find us easily), but never at the expense of clarity or depth. Our App (per the App Whitepaper) is another digital arm – it might provide interactive checklists or a way to connect with local FPA volunteers. Crucially, the app and website also encourage visitors to take offline actions (e.g., “Download this guide, print it and discuss with your family” or “Attend a local workshop”). This converts online engagement into real-world resilience.
