Procedurally, the Compass SOPs define chain-of-command and succession. For example, if a Chapter Lead (Phase 4) is unreachable for X hours during a crisis, the next in rank/phase (or a designated deputy) automatically assumes interim command for that chapter. Squads should be briefed on who that will be. Leadership signaling refers to how that is communicated to everyone when normal channels are down.  
One approach: **code words** or phrases delivered over general broadcasts that indicate leadership status. For instance, if HQ still has some broadcasting ability, they might transmit: “Condition BLACK, local command in effect.” This would mean that central command is going dark and all squads operate under their local leaders until further notice (essentially empowering Phase 3 squad leaders to coordinate among themselves). Conversely, if HQ regains comms, they might send: “Condition GOLD, net control restored at HQ,” signaling everyone to listen for coordinated directives again.
