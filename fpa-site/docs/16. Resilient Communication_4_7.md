**Maintenance and Training:** Squad quartermasters are typically responsible for the health of the mobile unit. This means regular function tests (at least monthly, the squad should unpack the unit, test the radio comms by contacting someone or a preset beacon, verify the tablet and knowledge base is up-to-date, and ensure the solar panels and battery are charging properly). Any firmware updates for the offline AI or new documents (new SOP versions, updated Alliance frequency lists) should be loaded promptly so the unit stays current. Drills should include setting up the unit under various conditions: day, night (with headlamps), rain (under a tarp), cold weather, etc. A well-trained team can deploy their mobile unit in any environment. We strongly encourage squads to practice “communication post drills” where they simulate being the only active node: turn off all cell phones, assume no outside help, then use only the mobile unit to solve a scenario (coordinate with another team via radio, look up a medical procedure offline, etc.). This builds confidence in the gear and highlights any weak points to fix _before_ a real emergency.
