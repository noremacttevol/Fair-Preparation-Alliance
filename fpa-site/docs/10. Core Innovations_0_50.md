Wins: squads are reporting much better communication – instead of long email threads or scattered text messages, they have a central feed for posting updates (some liken it to a private social feed for their team). The shared **inventory feature** has been great: squads list communal resources (like who has a chainsaw, who has a medical kit) which has facilitated resource sharing and planning. One squad discovered through the app that three members each were separately planning to buy an expensive water purifier – seeing this, they coordinated and pooled funds to buy one high-end unit to share, freeing resources for other needs. The emergency alert function was tested in a drill: one member hit the SOS when his “home was on fire” in a simulation, and every squad mate got an immediate notification with his GPS location.

It also identified a 12-person squad that was consistently struggling to meet (too large and geographically
