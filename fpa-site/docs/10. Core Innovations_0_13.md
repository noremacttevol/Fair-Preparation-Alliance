**Why it was created (problem it solves):** The prepper market is flooded with gear, not all of it quality or necessary. New members often ask, “What kind of X should I get?” and could be misled by flashy marketing or fear-based sales. This innovation addresses the **information overload and inconsistent quality** in preparedness gear. By having an approved list, we **solve analysis paralysis** for members and ensure everyone is equipped with dependable tools. It also confronts the problem of unfair pricing or scams in the survival gear world – FPA’s endorsements are merit-based and community-vetted, providing a **trustworthy filter**. In short, it makes sure our community’s resources are spent on gear that truly enhances resilience. _Preparedness experts (like Ready.gov) stress having the right supplies to survive on your own for days ([Build A Kit | Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/kit#:~:text=After%20an%20emergency%2C%20you%20may,the%20event%20of%20an%20emergency)) – our gear list makes it clear **which** supplies meet that need reliably._
