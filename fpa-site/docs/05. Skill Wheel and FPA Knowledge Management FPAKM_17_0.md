On the flip side, a new member might join and initially see many segments hovering near that 10% baseline, which could feel overwhelming (“I’m so far from being prepared!”). We mitigate discouragement in a few ways:  
- **10% Baseline:** As mentioned, everyone starts with at least some progress in every category. Psychologically, seeing even a little color in each segment conveys that they are _already on the journey_. No one is at zero.  
- **Early Quick Wins:** The system is tuned to make the first steps relatively easy to achieve. The first few quizzes or basic trainings a member completes might each give a substantial boost to a segment (we sometimes call this the “low-hanging fruit” effect). This provides quick wins and positive reinforcement. For example, attending an introductory first aid class might bump a brand-new member’s First Aid segment from 10% to 30%. Those visible jumps can be very motivating. As their skills advance, each additional percentage will likely require more effort (just like how in many RPG games, the first levels are easy to gain and later levels require more experience). This proven model keeps people engaged – you get hooked with rapid initial progress and then you’re invested in pursuing the more challenging gains.
