No plan is complete without analyzing potential risks and how we will mitigate them. The Skill Wheel and FPAKM system, while promising, comes with certain risks that we have anticipated and prepared for:  
1. **Data Accuracy and Truthfulness:** If the data feeding the Skill Wheel is inaccurate – say a member’s skills are overestimated or underreported – then the wheel’s output (and any AI analysis) will be flawed and potentially dangerous. **Mitigations:** We rely on verified inputs at every critical juncture. Early on, that means instructor sign-offs and documentation checks. For ongoing use, it means requiring multiple sources of evidence for significant skill claims (for example, you only get marked “proficient” if you’ve passed the quiz _and_ the drill). We’ll also enforce periodic re-tests and drills; skills can atrophy, so an annual or semiannual check-in will recalibrate the wheel if needed. If someone somehow “gamed” a quiz (e.g. cheated or memorized answers without learning), that should become apparent during the practical drill – at which point instructors can correct the record. Additionally, we will use cross-validation – if the AI or system notices inconsistencies (like a member with very high quiz scores but very low instructor evaluations on drills), it will flag that for human review. Our motto here is **“trust, but verify”** – trust what members input or claim, but have verification steps at multiple levels.
