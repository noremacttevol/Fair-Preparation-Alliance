In any community, conflicts or personal crises can arise, and FPA has measures to handle them fairly and constructively. If disagreements occur (say, on strategy or personality clashes), the Alliance prefers mediation: a neutral council member or respected elder member will facilitate a discussion to resolve the issue amicably. The code of conduct guides conflict resolution, reminding members to approach issues with respect and focus on common goals. On the support side, FPA also looks after its own â€“ if a member is struggling (perhaps lost a job or was hit by a personal emergency), the group might rally to provide assistance, reflecting the mutual aid principle. There is zero tolerance for toxic behavior: repeated violators of trust or respect may be asked to leave after due process. Overall, the Alliance fosters a supportive environment where members feel safe to voice concerns and know that the group will help them through challenges, not just disaster scenarios.
