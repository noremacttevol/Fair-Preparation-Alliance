kit or bulk medical supplies that are stored centrally with the chapter’s designated medic. Or invest in a community-owned emergency generator or water purification unit that could serve multiple families at a base location. These resources are managed by the group with clear rules on access. Caches and Staging: FPA establishes strategic caches of supplies. These can be hidden stores along evacuation routes (a sealed barrel with water, fuel, first aid, etc., buried or hidden) or at safehouses (a member’s farm outside the city might stock extra food and tools for the group). Logistics planning determines what to put in caches: items to resupply members if they have to flee with only a go-bag, or to sustain the group if bringing all their own stores wasn’t possible. [[Sneakernet (Physical Data Transfer)]] concept also extends to moving physical supplies if needed – e.g., having pre-packed bins that can be quickly loaded into a car or even hauled by a handcart in worst case. Maintenance and Rotation: A key part of resource management is keeping supplies viable. The group might have a rotating schedule to check caches – making sure stored food isn’t expired, fuel is rotated or treated, batteries are charged or replaced. They maintain a logistics calendar (maybe via Realnet or a shared document) that alerts when certain stored items need refreshing (e.g., rotate water storage every 6 months). If the group has a garden or livestock in a friendly member’s care, others pitch in
