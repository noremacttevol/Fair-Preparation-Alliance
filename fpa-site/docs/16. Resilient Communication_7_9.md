- **Encryption and Authentication:** At this level, members may be entrusted with Alliance cryptographic materials if we use them (such as one-time pad sheets or digital encryption keys for any secure comms). Training emphasizes how to properly use and, importantly, destroy these if in danger of capture (reflecting worst-case scenarios). They also establish authentication protocols: e.g., challenge-response codewords to ensure a radio transmission is genuinely from a friendly leader and not an imposter. This is critical because as Phase 3 leaders, they might be net controllers or sub-commanders whom others will obey; we need to guard against misinformation. Trust Doctrine principles are reinforced – honesty and verification go hand in hand.  
- **Leadership Communication:** Soft skills come in – how to give clear, concise orders over radio that others can follow even under duress. How to maintain morale through voice alone (your tone and words can either instill confidence or panic). Phase 3 folks often role-play crisis scenarios where they have to assume command via radio: e.g., coordinating a multi-squad evacuation from a wildfire path, only through voice comms, no visuals. They learn to use agreed code (so that instructions are unambiguous), double-confirm critical orders, and delegate tasks to sub-leaders on air.
