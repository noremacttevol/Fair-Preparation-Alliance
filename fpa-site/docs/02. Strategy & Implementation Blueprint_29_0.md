No plan survives first contact with reality unchanged. We recognize that as the world evolves and as we learn from experience, FPAâ€™s strategies and systems must adapt. The **Living System Clause** in this Blueprint formalizes our commitment that this document and the structures it describes are not static edicts, but a living framework subject to improvement. This ensures that FPA remains effective and relevant over time, while still holding true to its core mission and values.
