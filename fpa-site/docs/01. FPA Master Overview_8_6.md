- **Infrastructure & Hardware:** Tech & App Dev also covers the nuts-and-bolts infrastructure: servers (cloud and on-premises), networking equipment, and specialized hardware projects. They might run a small fleet of drones for reconnaissance (and write the software to coordinate them for search-and-rescue). They could be experimenting with off-grid power solutions for our tech (like a bike-powered generator to charge radios, or solar kits for each squad’s devices). When the Alliance decides to invest in something like a mobile command center van or a cluster of rugged laptops for field teams, this team researches and sets it up. They maintain the **approved tech gear list** (just as Readiness has one for survival gear, Tech has one for comms and electronics). For example, they’ll standardize on certain radio models or solar panel kits that have proven reliable. This makes maintenance and training easier – everyone’s on the same or compatible systems.
