When local infrastructure is gone, satellite devices can still connect or send messages globally, so FPA incorporates these for critical communications. Satellite phones are one option – they function like a cellphone that links to satellites instead of towers, enabling voice calls almost anywhere (though with a slight delay and requiring a clear view of the sky). A few FPA leaders or comms specialists might have sat phones reserved for worst-case scenarios to call out to, say, an unaffected region or to call for help from authorities. More common and affordable are satellite messengers (like Garmin InReach or SPOT devices) which allow short text messages or preset SOS signals over satellite. FPA encourages any member who already hikes or sails (where these devices are popular) to integrate them into the group plan. For example, if one member evacuates to a remote area with no cell service, they could still report “Safe at location X” via a satellite text that gets relayed to email or phone of someone who can inform the rest. These devices are also useful for getting updates – many can receive weather alerts or simple incoming texts from a web portal. The alliance’s communications SOP might designate that in a total blackout, if a satellite device is available, a brief daily situation report will be sent to an out-of-area contact or group distribution list (like “Group safe, staying at camp, supplies ok”). Satellite comms are limited by subscription costs and message lengths,
