- _Contingency Plan:_ If formal fundraising proves too difficult (some communities might have donor fatigue or distrust), focus on in-kind support: people may prefer to give stuff or time instead of cash. Solicit equipment loans or donations as earlier milestones discussed. Also, leverage cost-sharing: maybe propose that each member invest a small amount for personal gear (if they can) while the squad fundraises for community-level gear. Ultimately, remember FPA’s ethos – do what you can with what you have. A well-led, active squad can accomplish a lot on a shoestring by smart planning and community solidarity; money is secondary to will. But whenever possible, don’t leave available resources untapped due to fear of paperwork or asking – aim high because your community’s safety is worth it.
