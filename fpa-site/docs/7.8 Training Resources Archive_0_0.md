FPA maintains an archive of training resources so that members can continually educate themselves and each other. This archive includes lesson plans, slides, videos, and handouts from all the workshops and courses the Alliance runs. For example, if a member gave a session on HAM radio basics, the outline and any visual aids they used are saved so others can reuse or adapt them. The archive also contains external training materials: CERT program manuals, Red Cross first aid course books, wilderness survival course notes, etc., often obtained from public sources or created collaboratively. One section might be “Drill Scenarios,” documenting past exercise setups (like a mock earthquake drill narrative, objectives, and outcomes) which serve as templates for future drills. Another might be “Youth Education,” containing simpler teaching tools or games to involve children or teens in preparedness (like printable emergency prep bingo cards or scavenger hunts for home safety checks). By organizing these resources, FPA ensures knowledge transfer is easier – a chapter in one state can benefit from the training materials developed in another without reinventing the wheel. Members who miss a workshop can also catch up by reviewing the materials. This archive is cross-referenced in the Knowledge Vault, e.g., a note on “Fire Safety” might link to a training slideshow in the archive. Many resources are kept in both digital form (for quick sharing, perhaps on the group cloud drive) and hard
