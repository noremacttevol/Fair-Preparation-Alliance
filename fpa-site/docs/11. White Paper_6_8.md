- Schedule cross-training: plan that members will periodically swap roles during practice scenarios to prevent siloing of knowledge.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If no one wants to step up as coordinator, consider a rotating facilitator for each meeting rather than a fixed leader. If one person tries to dominate (a “self-appointed general”), gently remind them and everyone that FPA squads run on collaboration and transparency, not top-down orders. To avoid friction, embed the value that **leadership is a service role** – leaders serve the team by organizing, not by bossing. If roles aren’t getting filled (e.g., no one with medical background), note it as a capability gap and plan to seek external training or partnerships to cover it (for instance, have everyone take a Red Cross first aid class to collectively fill the “medical lead” gap).

- _Real-World Example:_ One coastal squad’s secret weapon turned out to be a local butcher who owned a walk-in freezer and a gas generator – crucial for cold storage during power outages. Another member had an old shortwave radio; another was an ex-paramedic. By pooling knowledge, they discovered they already had a mini fire station’s worth of capability among them. Mapping these out early let them plan who would bring what when a hurricane approached.
