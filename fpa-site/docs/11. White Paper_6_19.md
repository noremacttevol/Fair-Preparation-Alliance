- _Action Steps:_  
- As a team, list out known individuals in the neighborhood who might need extra help in a disaster. Sources: personal knowledge, suggestions from community leaders, or simply noticing who might be isolated.  
- For each person on that list, attempt gentle outreach _before_ any disaster. For example, knock on their door on a sunny day: “Hi, we’re a local community safety group. We’d like to include you in our emergency plan if you’re okay with that.” Explain you’re not selling anything – you just want to make sure they are safe during emergencies.  
- Ask if they have family or an emergency contact you could have on file, and if they’d like to share any specific needs (oxygen machine? mobility issues? do they have a backup plan?). Participation is voluntary – respect a “no.”  
- Assign each willing vulnerable resident to a squad member as their point-of-contact. This member will take responsibility to check in on them during events (and possibly to evacuate or assist if needed). It can simply be “neighborly visits” when alarms sound.  
- Keep a confidential list of these residents, their addresses, key info, and contacts. This list should be accessible to squad leadership and the assigned buddies, but not broadcast publicly to protect privacy. Review and update it every few months, as situations change.
