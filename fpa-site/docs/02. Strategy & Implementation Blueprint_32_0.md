Sometimes the need for evolution isn’t on a schedule but triggered by outside events or internal discoveries:  
- **Crisis-Driven Adaptation:** If a real-world crisis hits and we find our strategy lacking in some way, we will adapt immediately. The Living System Clause gives us the flexibility to override normal processes in an emergency to fix something critical. For example, if our comms plan failed in an actual disaster, we won’t wait months to address it – leadership can convene a special session to adjust the plan, roll out the fix (even if interim), and later formalize it. The key is to not be rigid when lives or mission success is at stake. Of course, even emergency changes are retrospectively logged and reviewed to ensure they were indeed wise and not rash.  
- **Pilot Programs:** To encourage innovation, we may allow pilot programs or experiments. A squad or region could try a new method or technology not officially adopted yet, with permission and oversight. Results of the pilot are then shared. If successful, the idea can be propagated to all squads. If not, we learned something at limited cost. This approach ensures we’re not stuck with only top-down generated ideas – innovation can be bottom-up. The Living System Clause endorses piloting as long as it doesn’t violate core safety or trust principles.
