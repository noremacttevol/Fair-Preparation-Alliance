- **Physical Fitness & Health:** Preparedness isn’t just gear and knowledge – it’s also personal fitness. Readiness & Drills emphasizes physical conditioning appropriate for roles. They might set baseline fitness assessments especially for those in active field roles or leadership. E.g., every member should be able to walk 5 miles with their go-bag, or do a certain number of push-ups, etc. They provide workout recommendations and maybe even group PT (physical training) sessions. Not to make it like boot camp, but the reality is if you can’t run or lift when needed, all the gear in the world won’t save you. They also include mental resilience and first aid for mental health as part of readiness – acknowledging crises are stressful, they teach stress inoculation techniques, breathing control, etc. The alliance needs to be not just physically but **mentally tough**.
