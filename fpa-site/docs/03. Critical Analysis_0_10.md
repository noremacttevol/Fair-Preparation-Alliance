in civil protection units, similar to military reserve duty). This is an extreme mainstreaming of “prepping” – every household is automatically part of civil defense by virtue of shelter regulations. FPA’s challenge (and potential) is to cultivate a similar culture of preparedness in countries like the U.S. where no such universal program exists. While FPA cannot build bunkers for everyone, it might lobby for policies or community projects that mirror the Swiss commitment on a smaller scale (e.g. encouraging home shelters or community caches). Key insight: Government-backed systems achieve scale and universality (FEMA’s reach, Swiss shelters) that FPA alone might struggle to attain. However, they can be bureaucratic or slow to adapt, whereas a grassroots network can innovate and mobilize community spirit faster. A balanced approach could see FPA collaborating with civil authorities: acting as a force-multiplier to official efforts (much as Civil Defense volunteers did in past eras).
