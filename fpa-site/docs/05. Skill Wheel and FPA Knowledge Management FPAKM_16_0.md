One risk of introducing any scoring system is that high-performing members might become complacent – e.g. someone hits a comfortable number and then stops pushing further. We address this in several ways:  
- **Unreachable 100%:** As described, the fact that no one can ever hit “100% complete” on their Skill Wheel sets the expectation that you are _never done_ training. Even the highest-ranked, most experienced members will always see a little slice of their wheel unfilled, which is a constant nudge that there’s more to learn.  
- **Evolving Criteria:** We will update the skill criteria _very sparingly_ over time to reflect new knowledge or emerging threats. If the world changes – say a new technology becomes important (e.g. satellite-based texting devices), or a new type of risk appears – we might introduce a new sub-skill or even a new category to the wheel. This creates fresh room to grow for everyone. (We will be careful not to move the goalposts too often, as that would frustrate members; the idea is to evolve the system along with genuine changes in the preparedness landscape.)
