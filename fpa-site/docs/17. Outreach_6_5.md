- **Building the Network (Squads and Interpreters):** Perhaps the most important aspect of pre-event outreach is recruiting and training the **interpreters of FPA doctrine**. Through the above channels, we identify engaged followers and deliberately bring them deeper into the fold. We might invite them to become _Squad Founders_ in their town if one doesn’t exist, or to join an existing local squad team. We provide pathways for involvement: an online course (with content from our SHTF Bible and other materials) to become an “FPA Certified Responder,” or a mentorship program where new volunteers are paired with experienced ones. The idea is to transform interested individuals into _active nodes_ of our network – people who don’t just consume information but begin to **produce and distribute** it. By the time a disaster is on the horizon, we want an FPA presence (formal or just a loose group of fans who know each other) in as many communities as possible. Those local groups will be invaluable during the crisis (they’ll man the radios, hand out flyers, coordinate local response as needed).
