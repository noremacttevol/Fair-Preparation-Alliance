**AI Assistance and App Integration:** Mk1Mod3 leverages technology more smartly. We have an upgraded **FPA App** that now integrates an AI assistant (Chapter 9). In day-to-day use, this means members can access a knowledge base or get recommendations quickly (even offline, since key data and AI logic are stored on-device). For example, if facing a water sanitation issue, a member can ask the app’s AI for guidance drawn from our SHTF Bible data. This was not present in Mk1Mod2 at all – it’s a new operational tool. The AI also helps leadership by crunching incoming reports and suggesting priorities, essentially augmenting our decision-making under pressure. Importantly, we’ve configured the system to work with limited connectivity: the AI can function in “offline mode” with pre-downloaded models if needed, and will sync updates when back online. This tech integration provides a force multiplier that was lacking before.
