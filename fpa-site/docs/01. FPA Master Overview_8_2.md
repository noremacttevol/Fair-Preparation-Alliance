- **Offline-First Resilience Systems:** A major focus of Tech & App Dev is our **Offline-First Resilience** architecture. They design systems that can **degrade gracefully**. For instance, they set up a content distribution scheme where any phone that goes online pulls the latest data (like updated SOPs or new intelligence reports) and caches it. Then that phone can silently share the data with nearby phones via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi direct. Essentially, every member’s device becomes part of a **peer-to-peer network** when central networks are down. Tech team tests these scenarios relentlessly: what if an entire region is isolated from the internet? They might deploy **local servers** (maybe a Raspberry Pi-based FPA server that some regional leads keep) that can sync via radio or satellite intermittently, acting as a bulletin board everyone in the region can connect to via local Wi-Fi. They also explore using LoRa mesh, FM packet radio, and other alternative comms for data. This team’s job is to ensure **information still flows and is usable at the edge**, no matter what. They frequently simulate outages and refine the tech accordingly.
