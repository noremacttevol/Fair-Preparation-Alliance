In summary, **Governance & Oversight** is what keeps the Fair Preparation Alliance truly _fair_ and well-prepared at the organizational level. They balance the passion and urgency of our mission with wisdom, restraint, and integrity. Thanks to them, our Alliance doesn’t devolve into chaos or authoritarianism – it stays principled and just. Members can trust that their contributions and rights are safeguarded. The community at large can look at FPA and see an organization that holds itself accountable. In the darkest of times, when law and order may fray, **our internal law and order will hold** – and that is largely due to Governance & Oversight’s tireless, and sometimes thankless, efforts. They ensure that while we prepare for the worst, we never lose sight of the best in ourselves.
