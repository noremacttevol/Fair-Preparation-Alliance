**(8) Personalized SHTF Plans & Scenarios**
**What it is:** A service and toolkit enabling every member to create and refine a **personalized “S*** Hits The Fan” (SHTF) plan** tailored to their unique situation, and to practice it through custom scenarios. This innovation delivers one-on-one plan consulting (via chapter mentors or the FPAi tool) and scenario generators that produce hypotheticals specific to the member’s locale and profile. Instead of generic checklists, members get a **bespoke emergency plan** covering family needs, medical issues, pets, local climate, etc. They also receive scenario packets – for example, “Winter grid-down in your town for 2 weeks” – and are encouraged to **role-play or drill** those scenarios. It’s complemented by templates and worksheets: think of it as both a personalized plan document and a choose-your-own-adventure practice system for crises.
