**Vendor Firewall in Action (Example):** Suppose a flashlight manufacturer, “BrightBeam Co.”, wants their new survival flashlight endorsed. They cannot pay us to do this. What they can do: they list the product specs publicly and perhaps send a unit to one of our testing squads. Our members test it like any other tip. During testing, a squad finds the flashlight fails after 2 hours of use, not 5 as advertised. We compile results and vote not to endorse. We then share our findings openly. BrightBeam Co. contacts us, concerned about the result. We invite them to discuss on our forum – they join and explain that a batch had a battery defect and they are fixing it. They offer to replace the test units and even supply a few extra for further testing. We log all this. Our members re-test the improved flashlight; this time it meets the claims. We then **endorse** the updated product, noting in the profile what changed. BrightBeam Co. gains our badge and, appreciating our process, they do not pay us but they do decide to offer a 20% discount to FPA members as a goodwill gesture. That too is logged and made known to members. Throughout, no money exchanged hands to influence results – just honest, transparent collaboration. This is how the firewall allows for positive relationships without compromising integrity.
