Support for Other Teams: Tech & App Dev doesn’t work in a vacuum; they actively support the other content families. If Governance needs a secure e-voting platform, Tech builds it (perhaps using blockchain for an auditable voting ledger). If Readiness wants a training simulator or an interactive quiz (like the “Test My Plan” self-assessment tool), Tech collaborates to produce that (see the [[Test My Plan – Questionnaire Technique Plan]] for an example of a member readiness evaluation tool). Tech also maintains the FPA website/portal for public info and new member onboarding, ensuring it’s secure and can handle surges (for instance, during a national scare when many people might try to join at once). In short, they provide technical solutions tailored to each team’s needs.  
Innovation & R&D: A portion of the Tech family is always looking ahead. They scan for new technologies that could aid FPA and prototype them. Could cheap LoRa text messengers be given to every member for backup comms? Is there a role for blockchain in our audit trail or supply chain? Can we use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools to better predict crises? The R&D folks experiment and then report findings to Core Coordination and Governance for potential adoption. They keep us ahead of the curve tech-wise against evolving threats. But they remain pragmatic – any tech we adopt must pass the resilience test (it has to be useful offline, easy to train people on, and not backfire if partially broken).
