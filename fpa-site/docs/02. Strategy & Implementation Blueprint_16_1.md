- **Permissions and Access Controls:** The stack enforces role-based permissions aligned with our governance. For example, only Tribunal members might have the ability to access certain sensitive data (like personal identifiable info in an incident report), and even then, it might require multiple Tribunal members’ consent (so no single person can abuse access – akin to a “two-man rule”). Similarly, posting an official update to the Compass Guide in the app might require a signed package from the authorized committee. These technical enforcement measures ensure that governance processes (like approvals and oversight) are not bypassed by a rogue admin or hacker. Even developers of the system do not have backdoor access to alter data without it being logged and noticed.
