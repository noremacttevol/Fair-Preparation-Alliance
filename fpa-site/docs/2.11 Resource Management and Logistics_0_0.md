FPA approaches resource management with the mindset that the network is its own supply chain in crises. While each member maintains personal stockpiles, the Alliance coordinates to optimize resources and fill gaps. Inventory and Skills Mapping: Early on, chapters do a capabilities inventory – not just who has what supplies (though broadly, yes, like number of generators, water filters, medical kits in the group) but also who has what skills or assets that can produce resources (like gardening, hunting, mechanical repair skills, or ownership of a truck that can haul heavy loads). This inventory is kept somewhat private (OPSEC considered) but is used for planning. Avoiding Duplication and Covering Gaps: If the inventory shows everyone bought water filters but no one has a grain mill, the group can suggest someone acquire a hand-crank grain mill or other missing tools. Or if five people have excess of one type of item and another has none, they might arrange swaps internally. FPA often coordinates group buys for essential gear to save cost and ensure each member has the basics from the gear list. Shared Resources: Some expensive or bulky items are collectively shared rather than each member individually buying. For example, a chapter might pool funds to buy a high-quality medical kit or bulk medical supplies that are stored centrally with the chapter’s designated medic. Or invest in a community-owned emergency generator or water purification unit that could serve multiple
