**Contingency Plan:** If fundraising falls short, prioritize implementation to critical areas. We might deploy Outernet to, say, 5 regions instead of 10 initially – focusing on those with most frequent disasters or poorest connectivity – and continue seeking funds for the rest. Develop a “minimal budget” plan using DIY and community resources: e.g., instead of buying manufactured receivers, have tech-savvy volunteers build kits from cheaper parts, or reuse old satellite TV dishes (lots of those lying around) to cut costs. Should an anticipated grant be denied, immediately pivot to alternate sources (break the project into smaller chunks that smaller grants could cover). And if absolutely necessary, slow the timeline – better to phase the rollout over an extra year than to abandon it. The emphasis is on persistence: by this stage, the value is proven, so we’ll keep pushing until every region is covered, even if it’s one bake sale at a time.
