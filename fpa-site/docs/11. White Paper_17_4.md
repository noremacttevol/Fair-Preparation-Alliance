**Contingency Plan:** If the Content Team’s uplink fails (say their internet goes down or their PC crashes), have an alternate path: maybe a second team member in a different city can send, or in a pinch, a sympathetic local university or media station might send the data for us (have those relationships ready). If key team members are unavailable during a crisis (everyone’s affected by the disaster too), empower regional comm leads to submit raw info which can be quickly packaged – basically decentralize content creation as backup, even if that means less polish. In case of controversial info (e.g., politically sensitive or unverified reports), default to not broadcasting until clarity – trust is paramount, and one false alarm can damage credibility. The Content Team should also integrate with Phase 3’s transparency ethos: log what they send and why, and be open to audit to ensure no biases or non-FPA agendas creep in. Finally, if bandwidth becomes an issue (too much content), prioritize by life safety: alerts > coordination info > educational materials; anything not sent can be cached for later transmission or distributed via other means (like physical pamphlets) if critical.
