**Links to FPA Resources:** Refer to the **Communications SOP: Radio Protocols** which outlines how to tune in and participate in Outernet broadcasts. The **FPA Dictionary** has entries like “Outernet” and “Packet Radio” explaining the tech and terms behind this【Dictionary†L40-L47】. This initiative aligns with the Compass Guide’s pillar of _“Redundant Communication Channels”_【CompassGuide†L66-L72】. It also draws on our **Trust Doctrine** – in crises, _transparent and frequent communication builds trust_【TrustDoctrine†L42-L48】, hence the importance of keeping the information flowing through any means necessary. For those interested in the nitty-gritty, our internal wiki has the **Outernet Ops Manual** detailing frequencies, schedules, and content guidelines (members with comms expertise are welcome to contribute!).
