- **Governance Interface:** The app isn’t just for emergency management – it also supports FPA governance. Members can use it to vote in internal polls, submit suggestions or feedback to leadership, and access organizational dashboards (like current readiness level, alerts, or announcements). All such interactions are also designed to work offline-first (for example, votes can be stored locally and forwarded when connectivity returns, with cryptographic protection to prevent tampering).  
- **AI Assistant (Reliable & Accountable):** Integrated into the app is the FPA’s AI assistant system, guided by our **AI Reliability & Oversight model**. This AI serves as a smart advisor and moderator:  
- **Advisor Role:** The AI can answer questions (drawing from the FPA knowledge base), help plan drills, and personalize training. If a member asks, “What items am I missing from my SHTF kit for a winter scenario?” the AI can provide a checklist based on known guidelines. All advice is sourced from vetted FPA materials or widely trusted data – the AI does **not** hallucinate new policies. Moreover, if the AI is unsure or the query is beyond its scope, it is designed to say so and/or flag a human expert.
