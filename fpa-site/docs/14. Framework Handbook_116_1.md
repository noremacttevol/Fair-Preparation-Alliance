- **Communication Bridge:** With power out, FPA’s radio network is the backbone for communication. Need requests from across town come in via ham and are relayed to those who can fill them. For instance, a squad in a less affected northern area has spare drinking water and another in a hard-hit southern area needs water – FPA coordinates a meetup to transfer supplies. Because roads are messy, they even coordinate via radio to send a convoy, with Security Leads riding along to handle any issues and ensuring those supplies reach the intended community distribution site.  
- **Dynamic Resource Deployment:** Here the dynamic pricing system goes into disaster mode – essentially free distribution but tracked. All those caches of supplies we stored? They’re opened. Everyone can take what they truly need, with volunteer quartermasters ensuring fairness. If someone tries to take way more than others (hoarding), gentle reminders of community spirit (and, if needed, point accounting) curtail it. It turns out pretty civil; people are grateful and reasonable when there’s transparency and they see everyone getting their share. FPA had prepared “community kits” (Tier 4) with things like blankets, hygiene items, etc., which now prevent a lot of suffering for displaced families.
