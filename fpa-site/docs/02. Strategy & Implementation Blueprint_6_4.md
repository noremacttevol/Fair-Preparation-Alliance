- **Data Privacy and Security:** All member data, from personal plans to communication, is treated as sensitive. The app uses end-to-end encryption for sync and messaging. Data stored offline on a device is encrypted at rest. The FPA does not data-mine member information; data is only used to support the member and their squad. When logs are synced to central storage for transparency, any personal identifiers can be anonymized if not essential. Our Trust Doctrine mandates that **members own their data** – the tech exists to serve them, not surveil them. Any exceptions (like sharing location during an active emergency to allow rescue) are opt-in and transparent.  
- **Open and Inspectable:** To build trust, the core code of the FPA app and AI configurations are open for inspection by the membership (and security-audited by independent experts). We avoid black-box systems. Members with technical expertise are encouraged to review the code or even run their own instance in a test mode to verify it behaves as described. This aligns with our transparency goal – “trust, but verify” is enabled by design.
