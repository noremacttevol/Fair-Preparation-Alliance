- **Training Aid:** The AI doubles as a tutor. You can have it quiz you on first aid steps or even role-play scenarios. For instance, “Practice wildfire response” might prompt the AI to simulate a situation, asking what you’d do next and giving feedback. It’s a personalized coach to reinforce skills.  
- **Translation:** In diverse communities, language can be a barrier. The AI can translate common languages offline. If you need to talk to a neighbor who speaks Spanish, you can speak into the app and have it play back or display the translation, and vice versa. It can also decode acronyms or jargon you hear (say, on a radio scanner).  
All these features work without internet since the AI’s core knowledge (the SHTF Bible, SOPs, etc.) and language models are stored on the device. We prioritized an offline-capable AI to match our infrastructure philosophy.  
**Limitations and Safe Use:** We treat the AI as an assistant, not an authority. It’s possible for it to be wrong or not fully aware of local specifics. The Trust Doctrine encourages users to verify critical info. The AI’s knowledge is intentionally bounded to our vetted sources to reduce errors. We regularly update it with new data (like lessons from after-action reports) to improve its usefulness. And, importantly, we educate members on its role – e.g., in medical scenarios, the AI can guide you through CPR steps, but if a trained medic is present, you’d defer to the human.
