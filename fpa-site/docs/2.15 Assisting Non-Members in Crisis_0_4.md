OPSEC While Helping: When providing aid to non-members, FPA is careful not to reveal the full extent of their capabilities or supplies. For example, if an FPA member gives food or water to a neighbor, they might frame it as a small personal reserve (“I have a little extra”) rather than indicating the group has a large cache. Medical help might be given using a basic kit in view, keeping the bulk of supplies hidden. If multiple members assist publicly, they won’t advertise they belong to an organized network – they just appear as good Samaritans from the neighborhood. This prevents FPA from becoming an obvious target for desperate mobs or authorities looking to requisition supplies.  
Helping Neighbors: Often members will aid their immediate neighbors, especially if they have established rapport pre-crisis. For instance, if a neighbor’s house is damaged or they lack water, an FPA family might invite them over for shelter or quietly share some water. This not only is morally right but also improves neighborhood security (a neighbor who is aided is less likely to become desperate and turn on those around them). Chapters discuss beforehand: who among their neighbors or extended family could be brought under FPA’s wing in an emergency? Those people might be given limited support. However, if a neighbor group is very large, FPA might encourage them to set up their own arrangements rather than taking full responsibility.
