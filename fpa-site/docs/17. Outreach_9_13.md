By studying these scenarios, FPA continually refines its strategy. We are essentially trying to inoculate communities against the failures of the past: infrastructure collapse, rumor mills, false alarms, and mixed messages. Each FPA outreach team member should be aware of these lessons as part of their training – it is, in effect, our **“Never Again” list** that justifies the systems we put in place. In doing so, we honor those who suffered in those events by ensuring their hardships guide us to do better.
