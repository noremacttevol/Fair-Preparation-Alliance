- **Community First:** Every member commits to the idea that what’s good for the community (the mission and people of FPA) guides decisions, rather than personal agendas. This is more of a value, but it’s in the Trust Doctrine to remind us that trust is fostered when people consistently see others acting for the common good. Selflessness and integrity go hand in hand with trust.  
These principles are taught during onboarding and reaffirmed in our communications. They are not just abstract values – they have concrete manifestations in how we’re structured, which we explain next.
