Mutual Accountability Agreements: Many teams in FPA create working agreements or team charters that outline how members will behave and how they will call each other out if the agreement is broken. For example, a squad might all agree that “We start meetings on time and be candid in meetings.” They also agree that if someone is late or holding back, others will point it out constructively. This way, it’s pre-authorized for peers to nudge each other. These agreements are revisited periodically. By explicitly setting norms, it’s easier and less personal to say, “Remember, we all agreed to speak up if we see an issue, so I want to mention that…”.  
360-Degree Feedback and Peer Reviews: In our evaluation and growth processes, we formally include peer feedback. Rather than solely top-down reviews, members regularly get feedback from teammates, subordinates, and cross-functional peers. This reinforces that accountability is horizontal, not just vertical. People know their colleagues will have a say in evaluating collaboration and integrity. This tends to motivate individuals to address issues directly with peers (since they know issues will surface anyway in feedback). It also catches behavior that only peers might see. For instance, if someone is polite to bosses but demeaning to colleagues, peer feedback will reveal that, and it can be addressed. The 360-feedback is developmental, not punitive, but patterns of poor peer feedback will trigger coaching or further action.
