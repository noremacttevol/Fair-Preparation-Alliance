- Identify a “Station Chief” within each squad receiving a unit – this person (or two as co-chiefs) is accountable for that equipment (keeping it powered, protected, and monitored). Note their name in the squad registry next to the equipment entry.  
- Integrate Outernet check-ins into squad routine. For example, ask that every evening, the station chief verifies the receiver got the day’s update and radios in a brief acknowledgment – this builds habit and immediately flags issues.  
- Tailor content where feasible: work with the Content Team (from Phase 3.8) to allow a portion of the daily broadcast to be region-specific. Perhaps partition the file so first half is national alerts, second half is region-tailored (with regions taking turns if needed due to bandwidth). This ensures relevancy and keeps squads engaged.  
- Update training materials based on pilot feedback and make them universal: create a short video tutorial (load it onto cheap USB sticks or microSD cards sent with the kit, since internet might not be available to watch it online) and include a hard copy of troubleshooting FAQs.  
- Encourage squads to incorporate Outernet into local drills: e.g., during a local exercise, simulate internet loss and have them rely on the satellite feed for info, so they build trust in it and proficiency.
