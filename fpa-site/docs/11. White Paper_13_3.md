**Contingency Plan:** If the scale of a national drill is too daunting for some squads (or if real disasters strike during the planned window), break it into regional segments that roll up into the national picture. For example, run eastern and western half drills separately if needed and then do a shorter link-up test. If technical failures occur mid-drill (say a key relay drops), either re-route on the fly (a great test of adaptability) or pause that part and reset as a learning experience. Should a squad completely miss the exercise (no-show), treat it as a red flag for follow-up training – in a real event that’s not an option. Moreover, keep the drill’s stakes low – remind everyone it’s okay to fail in practice. The real contingency is that we do **another drill** after fixes; Phase 3’s motto for comms is “test it till you trust it.”
