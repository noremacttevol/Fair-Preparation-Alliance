During these sessions, we also practice collective empathy – members listen to experiences different from their own. For example, one squad might share that they felt unsupported during a crisis, which others might not have known. This builds understanding and often solidarity as others realize “we’re in this together.” It reinforces the wholeness of the Alliance beyond individual silos.
