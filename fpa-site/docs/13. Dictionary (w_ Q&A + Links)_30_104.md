A: “Ethical scavenging” in FPA’s view is about gathering needed resources during a crisis without crossing into theft or exploitation. They likely define it with a few key points: scavenging should occur only from unclaimed, abandoned, or public resources once an emergency is in effect (for example, taking water from a public park spigot, or using debris wood to build a fire) – basically, “take only what is not clearly someone else’s property and only what you truly need.” If entering a property or building, it should be obviously vacated and not marked as someone’s stash or domain; even then, take care of not causing damage unnecessarily. They also emphasize giving back or paying forward: if you scavenge from a store or warehouse in a breakdown-of-law scenario, it’s because survival is on the line, and even then, FPA might suggest leaving a note or being prepared to compensate if order returns – it’s about intent and respect. No scavenging should harm others; e.g., do not steal someone’s generator gas while they sleep – that violates fair prep and trust. Instead, ethical scavenging might include salvaging usable items from junk yards to fix community infrastructure, or pooling unused items among neighbors (with permission). Enforcement is tricky, but FPA enforces it by social contract: members pledge to uphold these ethics, and if one is caught looting or stealing unjustly, they face consequences (likely expulsion, as it breaks trust). They train on alternatives: stockpile
