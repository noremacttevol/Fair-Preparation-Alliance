A: FPA might not have formal partnerships in a corporate sense (especially if it’s a grassroots alliance), but it likely builds relationships with organizations that share overlapping goals. For instance, they could collaborate with CERT programs (government-run, as mentioned), local fire departments, or community watch groups to co-host events or trainings. They might network with humanitarian NGOs like the Red Cross for disaster response knowledge exchange, or with ham radio clubs for comms training. If there are other prepper or survivalist organizations that are reputable and aligned ethically, FPA could share resources or joint exercises with them. Given the “Fair” in its name, FPA might also link up with community service orgs (like food banks, because prepping and food security connect) or environmental groups (sustainability can dovetail with self-sufficiency). They could use partnerships to gain legitimacy and reach; for example, a city’s Emergency Management office might view FPA as an asset and thus include them in local emergency drills. Internationally, perhaps they’d talk with similar preparedness networks in other countries to trade lessons. However, FPA might also be cautious: partnering should not compromise independence or OPSEC. They likely avoid entanglements with any groups that have extreme political agendas to keep FPA neutral and focused. So, partnerships are pragmatic and about mutual benefit: training opportunities, community resilience projects,
