- **Military Readiness and Cross-Training:** Military organizations track the readiness of their personnel across multiple skill domains (physical fitness, marksmanship, medical training, technical skills, etc.). In elite units, every operator has a primary specialty but is _cross-trained_ in the fundamentals of the others’ specialties, to ensure no critical skill gap on a team. For instance, a U.S. Army Special Forces team (ODA) has designated weapons experts, medics, engineers, communicators, etc., but each member is expected to know at least basic skills in all those areas – so if the medic is down, someone else can perform essential aid. This directly influenced our “no 0%” policy – we want every FPA member to have some capability in each area, just like an ODA member can handle themselves even outside their specialty. The military also provides models for how to reward proficiency (they issue marksmanship badges, for example, at different levels) and enforce ongoing qualification (annual requalification on weapons or fitness tests). We borrowed from that by planning periodic re-tests and by potentially using small icons for milestones on the wheel. On the flip side, the military can sometimes fall into a “checklist” mentality, where people chase qualifications for promotion points rather than truly internalizing skills. We are very conscious of that pitfall – our system focuses heavily on practical demonstration and verification, not just accumulating certificates.
