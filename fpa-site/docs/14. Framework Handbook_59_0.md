The Trust Doctrine is essentially FPA’s code of ethics and mutual aid. It is outlined in a guiding document that every member receives and vows to uphold. Its core principles include:  
- **Integrity:** Members should be honest in all communications. No rumors, no misinformation. If you don’t know something, say so; if you promise to do something, do it. This principle builds credibility both within the squad and with outside partners.  
- **Accountability:** Everyone takes responsibility for their actions. Mistakes will happen, especially under pressure. Mk1Mod3 culture is to own up to errors and fix them, not to assign blame. Accountability also means each member keeps their preparedness commitments (like maintaining gear and attending training) because others are counting on them.  
- **Mutual Respect:** All members are treated with respect, regardless of background, skill level, or how “prepared” they are. In practical terms, this means listening to each other’s concerns, valuing diverse perspectives, and avoiding the elitism that sometimes creeps into prepper groups. A newbie’s question is as valid as a veteran’s advice.
