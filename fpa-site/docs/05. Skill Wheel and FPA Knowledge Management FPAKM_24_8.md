A common pitfall is when **the metric becomes the goal**, rather than the real-world outcome it’s supposed to represent. For example, someone might focus on earning points or maintaining a streak even if they aren’t truly improving their skills. Expert commentary on gamification stresses focusing on meaningful progress and avoiding “shiny badge” distractions ([How to Avoid Common Gamification Measurement Mistakes](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-some-common-pitfalls-mistakes-avoid-when-measuring#:~:text=When%20setting%20goals%2C%20it%27s%20crucial,periodically%20to%20ensure%20they%20stay)).

For instance, one article advised to “avoid vanity metrics that sound impressive but don’t actually move the needle” and to periodically review goals to ensure they remain relevant. We adopted that philosophy by, for example, capping quiz-only progress and emphasizing drills – making sure that what goes up on the wheel truly represents improved survival chances (i.e., _moving the needle_ in readiness). We also plan to regularly re-evaluate our
