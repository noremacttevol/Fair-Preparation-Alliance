**Integration & Next Steps:** This strategy is structured modularly, with each section cross-linking to deeper references like [[User Journey Maps]], [[Application System]], [[Trust Doctrine]], [[Compass Guide]], and [[Offline Resilience]] plans for further detail. Phase1 plans are ready for immediate implementation with clear developer tasks (build form, admin review UI, basic caching, etc.), while Phase2 and Phase3 provide a **visionary roadmap** to guide development iterations and ensure every new feature aligns with FPA’s end goals. By following this phased, values-driven approach, the FPA team and developers will not only deliver a functional application but nurture a resilient community where each user’s journey reinforces the alliance’s mission of fair, collective preparedness.
