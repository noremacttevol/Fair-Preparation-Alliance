All these systems are interlinked, and they are also continually improved. We encourage members to suggest tweaks after every drill or real operation. Some elements (like the new AI integration and certain aspects of the Trust Firewall algorithms) are **flagged as experimental**, meaning we’re testing them in pilot programs and they’re not yet ratified as permanent policy. Those are always clearly labeled in our internal communications so everyone knows what’s gospel and what’s a trial run. As we grow, new protocols will be added – but always with that same FPA attitude: **keep it practical, keep it transparent, and don’t let the system overpower the mission**.
