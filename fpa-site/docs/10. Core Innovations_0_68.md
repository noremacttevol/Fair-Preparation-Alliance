**Links to FPA Resources:** Refer to the **FPA AI Ethics Policy** (posted in the Docs section of the member site) which outlines the do’s and don’ts of our AI. The **Oversight Committee Charter** and meeting minutes are available for transparency ([5 AI Auditing Frameworks to Encourage Accountability](https://auditboard.com/blog/ai-auditing-frameworks#:~:text=like%20Siri%20and%20Alexa%20to,misuse%2C%20and%20worse%2C%20regulatory%20roadblocks)) ([5 AI Auditing Frameworks to Encourage Accountability](https://auditboard.com/blog/ai-auditing-frameworks#:~:text=AI%20auditing%20ensures%20that%20organizations,design%2C%20development%2C%20deployment%2C%20and%20monitoring)). See Compass Guide’s note on _“Human-in-the-loop”_ – a principle we adopted to always keep human judgment in AI decisions【CompassGuide†L98-L104】. The **Trust Doctrine** also covers our stance that technology must earn trust just as people do, and describes the accountability we require (it mentions that any AI decisions impacting members must be auditable and contestable)【TrustDoctrine†L80-L88】. These protocols ensure FPA remains on the cutting edge of tech _and_ ethics, maintaining member trust above all.
