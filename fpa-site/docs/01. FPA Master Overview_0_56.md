Ethics & Principles Oversight: This group keeps the Alliance ethically grounded. If Tech & App Dev proposes a new AI that, say, monitors members’ personal devices, Governance will weigh privacy implications and likely say “No, that violates member privacy.” If Readiness wants to run a drill that could alarm the public (like simulated gunfire in a neighborhood), Governance might impose limits or require coordination with authorities. They ensure all operations maintain respect for laws and community norms. They also prepare for grey areas: e.g., in an extreme catastrophe, some actions (like commandeering supplies) might be necessary – Governance discusses these scenarios in advance and provides guidelines so if it ever happens, it’s done thoughtfully out of necessity, not rashly. In short, they keep us honorable, even when times get tough or temptations arise to cut corners.
