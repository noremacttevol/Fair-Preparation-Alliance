**(7) Outernet Radio + Local Podcast Loop**
**What it is:** An **offline-first information network** that combines traditional radio broadcasting with a community-driven “podcast” content loop, ensuring that even if the internet goes down, FPA members stay informed and inspired. The “Outernet Radio” aspect refers to our use of HAM and long-range radio frequencies to broadcast updates, news, and training segments. The “Local Podcast Loop” is our innovation to make these broadcasts engaging and relevant: essentially, chapters create short audio programs (like 15-minute mini-podcasts on prepping tips, local intel, interviews with experts) which are then looped and shared across our radio network and also downloadable for offline listening. We call it Outernet because it’s the outside-the-internet channel for FPA content. The system also involves setting up local FM/AM micro-transmitters in communities so even non-HAM folks can tune in on a regular radio. In practice, members might schedule a time (say evening) to listen to the FPA Outernet broadcast which might include the day’s news, a training tip of the day, and a spotlight story from a member – all without needing Wi-Fi or cell service.
