- **Amendment Process:** Changes to this doctrine can be made through amendments. Any member in good standing can propose an amendment (as noted in Experimental Initiatives, we’re trialing an online submission system for this). Typically, an amendment proposal should include: the exact change or addition text, the rationale, and ideally some evidence or experience that justifies it. The proposal is then discussed by the community. It may be refined through comments. When it’s ready, it’s put to a vote (possibly alongside a batch of other amendments if timing coincides). Amendments usually require a supermajority to pass, just like initial ratification, to ensure stability and consensus. Once passed, the doctrine document will be updated to include the amendment (with versioning noted). For transparency and record-keeping, we maintain an appendix or separate log of all amendments and the dates they were adopted, so that anyone can track the evolution of the doctrine. We also label experimental clauses in the document, and when those are either adopted fully or discarded, we update or remove those labels.
