|**Medic**|Takes charge of health and first aid. The Medic keeps the squad’s medical kit stocked and knows how to use it. In an emergency, they treat injuries or illness among squad members and potentially neighbors. They also advise on public health issues (sanitation, disease prevention) during prolonged crises. The Medic often runs basic first aid training for the rest of the squad as well, since one person cannot handle multiple casualties alone.|
|**Security Lead**|Responsible for safety and security. This role involves risk assessment (identifying potential threats to the group), securing the squad’s home base or retreat location, and organizing self-defense if ever required. The Security Lead might coordinate neighborhood watch activities, ensure safe evacuation routes, and vet any strangers who approach the group during a crisis. Their goal is to protect people and assets while maintaining FPA’s ethical standards (defense is acceptable, exploitation or aggression is not).|
