- _Contingency Plan:_ If an evaluation finds lackluster performance and low energy, consider calling in external perspective – maybe an FPA regional coordinator or an experienced squad leader from another area can sit in and provide tips. Sometimes fresh eyes spot gaps and solutions the internal team misses. If meetings have become too routine or aimless, use the plan review to reignite purpose by setting a bold new goal (“By next year, we’ll train 100 neighbors in basic preparedness” or “We’ll establish 3 more squads via mentorship”). Make sure to address any interpersonal issues too – if there’s internal friction, an honest debrief can surface it so it can be resolved through mediation or restructuring roles. The plan should be seen as a tool to help the squad, not a rigid homework assignment – so keep it flexible and user-friendly.  
50 milestones (and possibly more) have been covered in detail above, covering recruitment, training, communications, integration, technology, growth, and continuous improvement for local squad formation. Each is designed with practical steps, real examples, lessons, and contingencies, aligning with FPA’s values of aggressive realism, decentralization, transparency, empowerment, and action. With these milestones, a community squad – no matter how resource-constrained – can systematically develop into an effective, life-saving unit.
