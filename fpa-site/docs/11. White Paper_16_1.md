**Lessons Learned:** The national rollout underscored the importance of local ownership. Some squads were quicker to set up and utilize their receivers than others – often because they had a tech enthusiast on hand. Where we just dropped off equipment without thorough training, usage lagged. So we learned to accompany every deployment with hands-on training sessions. We also discovered maintenance needs: a few receivers went down due to minor issues (e.g., misaligned antenna after a storm) and squads didn’t notice for weeks. The takeaway: assign responsibility for each station to someone, and include routine check-ins. Lastly, we realized one content stream didn’t fit all – regions requested the feed include region-specific info (like West Coast earthquake tips vs. East Coast hurricane prep), prompting us to segment some of the broadcast content by region.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Ship or deliver Outernet receiver kits to each regional relay squad (and additional high-need squads). Each kit includes all components plus a printed quick-start manual.  
- Schedule installation tours: if possible, send a small tech team traveling region to region to assist squads in physically setting up their receivers, aiming/anchoring antennas properly, and testing signal quality on the spot.
