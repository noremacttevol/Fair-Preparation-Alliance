- **Net Control Station (NCS) Training:** They learn how to run a directed net effectively. In a busy emergency frequency, an NCS manages check-ins and traffic such that everyone gets heard in turn. Phase 3 members practice being the net control for chapter drills. This involves decisiveness (breaking into ongoing chatter to restore order), good listening (taking notes of who has traffic waiting), and prioritization (knowing that an emergency report trumps a routine message and scheduling accordingly). They also learn to deal with interference or jamming attempts calmly by switching frequencies or using relays.  
- **Cross-Band and Gateway Operations:** A higher-level skill where they might have to link different comm systems. For example, using a mobile radio as a **cross-band repeater** (receiving on one frequency, retransmitting on another) to connect a low-power team deep in a valley to the rest of the network. Or serving as a human gateway: monitoring a HAM frequency and a CB channel and passing messages between, or between analog radio and a digital device. They also explore digital modes on HAM (like Winlink email, APRS position reporting, or slow-scan image transmission), which could be vital for sending data (like a list of medicines needed) when voice is inefficient.
