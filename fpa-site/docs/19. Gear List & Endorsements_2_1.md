- **Member-Driven Verification:** The power of endorsement lies with our members. From initial gear tips to hands-on testing and final approval votes, our community drives the process. No single “expert” or outside sponsor dictates what we endorse. We trust in the collective skill, diversity, and honesty of our membership to surface the truth. In return, members earn recognition (e.g. Readiness Cred) for contributions to the cause.  
- **Ethical Integrity:** The FPA holds itself to the highest ethical standards. We maintain a strict firewall between vendor interests and our endorsement decisions. No pay-to-play, no hidden agendas. Endorsements are **earned, never bought**. If mistakes happen (for instance, a product we endorsed later fails or is revealed as faulty), we own it, correct it openly, and improve our process. Trust is our currency, and we spend it carefully.  
_Member Benefit:_ These principles ensure that as a member you can **trust the gear you acquire** through FPA recommendations. You save money by avoiding gimmicks, gain confidence knowing your tools are proven by peers, and help build a fair marketplace that rewards quality.
