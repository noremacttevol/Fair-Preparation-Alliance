- **Mental Health and Community Cohesion:** A subtle but important facet of post-event outreach is addressing the psychological aftermath. Our communications include acknowledging grief and stress. We provide info about counseling resources, or simply encourage neighbors to talk to each other. We might organize a community vigil or story-sharing circle as part of healing â€“ which we would announce and facilitate. The message is: _Preparedness is not only about physical survival, but also about emotional resilience_. An example outreach might be distributing a small booklet (again, offline-capable) about coping with trauma and loss, derived from expert input, as part of our printed series. By doing this, we position the FPA as not just concerned with the immediate emergency but the holistic well-being of communities.
