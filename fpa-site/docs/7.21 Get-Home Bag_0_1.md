- Cash & Copies: some cash in case of power outage affecting card payments, and copies of IDs/emergency contacts if you need to prove identity or get through checkpoints.  
- Tools: a multi-tool or small knife, a pry bar (some carry a small crowbar in car kits to get out of or into structures if needed), and dust mask and goggles (particularly for urban folks concerned about building damage or subway tunnel evacuations).  
- Fire & shelter: usually not a full tent, but maybe an emergency blanket or bivvy and a way to start fire if absolutely stuck overnight outdoors.
The philosophy is that if something goes down (transit outage, sudden riot, natural disaster), you can hoof it home safely. This bag assumes you’re not planning to camp out for long – just to get to your main supplies or loved ones. FPA’s training includes planning “get-home routes” and rendezvous if family members are scattered. Members often keep get-home kits in their vehicles (along with comfy clothes and walking shoes). If they commute, they know at least two ways home (one might be longer but safer). The get-home bag is a bit of insurance to bridge the gap between the moment of crisis and reaching home base or group rally point. By prepping this, FPA reduces the chance of members being stranded or becoming victims when trying to regroup – it turns commuters into confident travelers under duress who can navigate chaos and reach the safety of home or community with the aid of their trusty little kit.
