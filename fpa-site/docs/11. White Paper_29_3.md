- Create a process for submitting amendments: any squad or member can propose a change, but perhaps funnel them through regional councils for refinement. Use the AI to gather related context (e.g., what happened that spurred this change, what other text would it affect) and include that in the briefing materials.  
- Assemble a diverse committee to draft the initial slate of changes before the convention – include veteran members, newcomers, different regions, maybe even an external advisor (like a disaster ethics expert) for perspective. This committee works with AI to ensure clarity and alignment with core values.  
- Host the convention in a hybrid format: encourage as many as feasible to meet physically (build camaraderie) with remote links for those who can’t. Ensure real-time translation or summaries if needed for any language barriers as we go global.  
- Use the agreed voting mechanism (from Phase 3.17) to ratify changes. Ensure there’s ample time for squads to discuss draft changes locally before final votes – this might mean releasing draft proposals months in advance and letting feedback come in (aided by AI aggregating common concerns perhaps) to refine language.
