Q48: Do I really need a bunker or underground shelter?
A: For most people, no. A full-scale underground bunker is overkill in the vast majority of situations and very expensive to build and maintain. While a bunker might help in extreme scenarios (like a nuclear event or a tornado direct hit), the likelihood of needing a dedicated fallout shelter is low. Most disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, blackouts, etc.) can be weathered with good planning in a normal house or apartment. If you live in a tornado-prone area, a small storm cellar or safe room makes sense – but you don’t need a military-style bunker. It’s usually better to invest your time and money in realistic preparations (food, water, securing your home, maybe a generator) rather than a buried shelter. There’s nothing wrong with having one if you have the resources, but it’s far from a prepping necessity. [#Beginner] [#Security]
