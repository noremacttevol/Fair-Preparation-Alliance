- Run a communication drill: simulate an emergency at an odd hour. See how long it takes to reach everyone with Tier 1. Document who didn’t respond and follow up to update their info or method. Then simulate phone network failure and try Tier 2 or 3 (this could be done in a daytime drill for practicality).  
- Fine-tune based on drill results. Assign some members specific roles like “neighborhood runner” or “radio caller” for backup. Ensure even the low-tech tools are in place (e.g., everyone should have a whistle or know the designated meetup point if all else fails).  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If literacy or tech is an issue (some may not use smartphones), rely more on phone call trees or in-person notification. For hearing-impaired members, include text-based or visual signals (like a pre-agreed flashing porch light pattern for “need help” or “evacuate now”). Always assume the worst-case – if a disaster happens at 3 AM, power is out and cell towers are down, **how will you mobilize?** Plan for that scenario, not just the convenient ones. Keep the plan written and revisited; update it whenever membership changes.
