- **Adaptive Messaging and Life-Saving Guidance:** During a crisis, our messaging must adapt in real time to the community’s needs. We follow a **“need-to-know and need-to-act” principle**: prioritize information that people _need to know_ for safety and _need to act on_ immediately. Our communications team (even if operating from a bunker or remotely via radio) will curate outgoing messages: warnings, instructions, locations of help, and reassurance. Each message tries to include a specific action or advice (e.g., “_If you are in Zone A and still able, move to the high school gym by 5 PM for evacuation._”). We avoid blasting generic news that doesn’t guide action, because noise can overwhelm people’s ability to decide. The only exception is messages meant purely to comfort and maintain morale (“_We are all in this together – help is on the way._”), which have their place to prevent despair. And because we are decentralized, local teams can add their own flair – they know the culture, so maybe in one community a message references a local landmark or uses the local language idioms to ensure people understand. We encourage that localization as long as the core content is consistent.  
**Example Scenario (During-Event):** A hurricane has made landfall and power/communications are down in a coastal region. By this time, FPA’s preparedness outreach would have placed a few HAM radio operators and an FPA squad in the area. As the storm passes:
