- **Professional Skill Self-Assessments (Corporate “Radar” Charts):** In some industries and corporate training settings, individuals use tools like _radar charts_ or _skill wheels_ to self-assess their proficiency in various competencies (for example, a software engineer might rate themselves in algorithms, system design, communication, teamwork, etc.). These often look very similar to our wheel concept. Typically, these are used for personal development discussions – you visually see that, say, one dimension is much lower than others and make a plan to improve it. One insight from these tools is that the **visual unevenness** is itself a motivator; people naturally want to “fill out” a lopsided shape. We absolutely are leveraging that psychology. When a member sees their wheel has one or two glaring dents, most will be driven to work on those. However, another caution from these systems is that self-assessment can be unreliable – many people overestimate or underestimate their skills. That’s why our percentages are _not_ self-assigned; they are earned through objective measures. We ensure data accuracy via tests and verifications, rather than someone just rating themselves. In other words, we took the best part of those radar charts (the visualization of imbalance) and avoided the worst part (inaccurate self-reporting) by building a more objective backend.
