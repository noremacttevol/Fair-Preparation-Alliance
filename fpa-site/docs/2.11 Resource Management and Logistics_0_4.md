as supply chains slowly recover, but Phase 2’s robust resource management can make the difference between life and death. Transportation Logistics: If the network spans a region, they plan routes for moving goods between chapters. Perhaps one rural chapter has surplus harvest, and an urban chapter has extra medical supplies – in a stable moment, they might coordinate a swap via an agreed meeting spot. The Alliance leverages Realnet to coordinate these moves under the radar. In summary, FPA treats the combined assets of members as a coordinated arsenal against disaster. Through planning and cooperation, they amplify what individuals have, minimize waste and shortfalls, and ensure resilience through sharing. Many members find comfort knowing that even if they personally lack something, the Alliance likely has it covered and vice versa – which is the essence of a fair alliance. (Cross-ref: [[Sharing of Resources]] is echoed in the ethos of mutual aid, and [[Barter and Trade Strategies]] becomes relevant in Phase 3 when dealing with outside networks.)
