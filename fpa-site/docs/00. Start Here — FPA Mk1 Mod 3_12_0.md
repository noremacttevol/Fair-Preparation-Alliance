_Integration of artificial intelligence and oversight within FPA operations._  
- [[5.1 - AI Reliability & Human Oversight]] – Protocols ensuring that AI tools are used safely and effectively. Describes how the Alliance mitigates AI risks (like errors or bias) through human oversight, verification steps, and fail-safes, so that autonomous systems augment rather than endanger FPA decisions.  
- [[5.2 - Core AI Demands Built into FPA]] – Fundamental requirements and constraints designed into FPA’s AI systems. Lists the non-negotiable principles (e.g. transparency, alignment with FPA values, data security, explainability) that any AI or algorithm must comply with to be trusted for Alliance use.  
- [[5.3 - FPAi Tone and Voice Guidelines]] – Profile and communication style guide for FPA’s AI assistant (often referred to as **“FPAi”**). Defines the AI’s persona, tone, and language – ensuring it speaks with an appropriate, consistent voice when interacting with members or the public (e.g. calm, informative, and aligned with FPA’s operational realism).
