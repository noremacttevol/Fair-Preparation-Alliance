19. **Milestone 19: Join or Form a Community VOAD (Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster)**  
- _Real-World Example:_ In one region, the FPA squads collectively joined the county’s VOAD, which is a coalition of nonprofits, churches, and volunteer groups that respond to disasters. By being at that table, the squads gained access to a larger communication network and resources. For instance, when a wildfire hit, the VOAD coordinator was able to deploy the FPA squads to assist the Red Cross in setting up evacuation centers, since they knew of the squads through VOAD meetings. Conversely, the squads learned about resources like emergency grants and supplies offered by other VOAD members (like a food bank willing to pre-position water and food in their communities).  
- _Lessons Learned:_ **Integration is not only with government but also with the nonprofit ecosystem.** VOADs exist in many areas to coordinate volunteer efforts. If one exists, being part of it plugs your squad into an information and resource pipeline. If none exists, you can spark that collaborative spirit by linking with neighboring community groups for mutual aid. **Lesson:** A lone squad is good; a network of allied groups is exponentially better. It aligns with FPA’s transparency and cooperation values – everyone knowing who’s doing what.
