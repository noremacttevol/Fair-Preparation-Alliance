- **Flag for Review (Yellow):** If the AI finds the answers lacking (e.g. very vague, minimal effort, or slightly off-topic), it doesn’t outright reject, but flags the application as “Yellow” for **manual human review**. An admin will check these borderline cases (within 48 hours) and make the final call. This human-in-the-loop catches any false negatives (someone sincere but who wrote an unclear answer) and upholds the [[Trust Doctrine]] by not letting AI fully decide edge cases. The admin can then approve (with a welcome email) or reject with feedback and a resubmission invitation.  
- **Auto-Rejection (Red):** If the application is clearly spam, malicious, or egregiously misaligned (e.g. the motivation talks about unrelated or violent intentions), the AI will auto-reject it. Rejections still log reasons, and the applicant can be given a polite notice or chance to try again if appropriate. This protects the community from obvious bad actors or bots without wasting admin time.
