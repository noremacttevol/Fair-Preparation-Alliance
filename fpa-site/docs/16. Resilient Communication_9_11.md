**Interoperability of People and Systems:** Integration also means that the communications doctrine helps implement the interpersonal trust and structure. For instance, we talk about Alliance Points – that’s part of trust/rank system. When we say we reward comms upgrades, that’s referencing the Alliance’s system of recognition (Trust Doctrine covers why we trust experienced more, etc.). When we mention members mentoring others (Phase 3 teaching Phase 1), that’s aligning with Compass (leadership responsibilities) and Trust (trust through teaching).  
**No Fluff, Field-Proof Clarity:** One could say that is also integration with our Alliance culture – we favor clear, direct, actionable content (part of Trust is not misleading with jargon, part of Compass is being practical). So this document is written to be used in the field. It means someone can literally have it printed in their binder, and its instructions and tables should be directly applicable in a crisis with minimal interpretation. That aligns with _Offline-First_ (have it on paper) and _Compass_ (straightforward guidance under pressure).
