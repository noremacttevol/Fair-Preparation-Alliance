- **Member Consensus and Amendments:** Changes to this governance blueprint can be proposed by any Core Member. Major changes (say, a new membership rank system or a reorganization of circles) would typically be deliberated in local circles, then brought to a council or all-member referendum. We strive for consensus (general agreement with no strong objections), but we have fail-safes like supermajority voting if needed to resolve a stalemate. Importantly, we insist on **broad member engagement** for changes – no small committee will secretly rewrite the rules. Draft changes are published for everyone to review and debate (with references to the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]] for any new jargon and tie-ins to the [[Trust Doctrine]] to ensure we’re aligned with our core ethos). Time is given for feedback, alternatives, and refinement before anything is decided. This can be messy, but it’s crucial for legitimacy. When a change is adopted, we update the blueprint and clearly annotate what changed and why. The old versions are archived for reference, so our history of governance is transparent. Everyone will know what version of this “constitution-grade” document we’re on (though we avoid calling it a _constitution_, it really is our constitutional framework in spirit). This living document approach means we’re never stuck with outdated practices – we learn and adapt, just as we expect our members to learn and adapt in the field.
