Tech Training & Helpdesk: Lastly, the Tech family helps members actually use the tools. They produce user-friendly manuals and how-to videos for the app and devices. They might run a helpdesk or tech support line, especially as less tech-savvy members join (no one gets left behind due to a tech gap). They also organize training sessions on topics like “Radio Communications 101,” “Setting up Your Outernet Kit,” or “Cybersecurity for Preppers.” This overlaps with Readiness & Drills when it comes to execution, but Tech provides the subject-matter expertise. In essence, they not only build the tools – they teach the Alliance how to use them effectively.  
In summary, Tech & App Dev is the powerhouse that ensures FPA’s ideals are backed by cutting-edge yet reliable technology. They embody the principle that advanced tools must serve us even in the worst conditions, not just the best. When you see our app working flawlessly offline, or hear a synthesized AI voice on the radio reading an intel brief, or witness a drone dropping medical supplies after a disaster, that’s Tech & App Dev’s fingerprints. They enable the Alliance to operate smarter, faster, and farther – all while hedging against the failure of those very technologies. In FPA, tech isn’t a vulnerability; thanks to this team, it’s one of our greatest strengths, forged to be resilient.
