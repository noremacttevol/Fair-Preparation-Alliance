- **Accountability and Ongoing Review:** This blueprint is also a tool for **leadership accountability**. We review it at least annually (for example, at an all-hands gathering or council summit) to ask, “Are we living up to this? Did any part of this prove unrealistic or get ignored in practice?” If a council or leader strayed from the blueprint, members can point to the text and demand correction. If reality showed a gap in the blueprint, we fill it. For instance, after a large-scale multi-state flood response last year, members noted that our blueprint lacked clear guidance on inter-circle resource sharing during sustained operations – we realized we needed a better protocol for long multi-region events. That feedback directly led to drafting an addendum (which eventually became part of Section VI on Operational Protocols). By treating this document as a **shared covenant**, we give every member the words and structure to challenge or justify actions. It’s not a lofty manifesto that sits on a shelf – it’s something we actively use and check ourselves against.
