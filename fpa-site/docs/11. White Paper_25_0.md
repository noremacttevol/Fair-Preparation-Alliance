**Description:** Establish a representative National Council for FPA, composed of regional representatives and key officers, to provide coordination and governance at the national level. The council’s role is to set broad strategy, uphold the Trust Doctrine, mediate inter-region issues, and manage initiatives that span beyond any one squad or region (like Phase 3 itself). Importantly, this council operates on democratic and transparent principles, not as a top-down authority. It’s more of a board of trusted coordinators ensuring the alliance moves in one direction when needed without infringing on local autonomy.
**Real-World Example:** In 2025, after several months of ad-hoc national planning calls, FPA convened its first National Leadership Council meeting (virtually, across multiple radio and internet links). Each of the 10 regions had elected or agreed on one representative (O-5 rank) to send, and a few specialized leads (like the head of the Outernet Content Team and an advisor for training) joined as well. In that meeting, they tackled issues like standardizing certain protocols and planned Phase 3 rollout details. The council elected a chairperson (the acting O-10, purely as a facilitator) and set a schedule for regular meetings. When Hurricane Omega struck in 2026, this council quickly assembled to coordinate multi-region support, proving its worth by avoiding duplication of effort and sharing resources intelligently across state lines.
