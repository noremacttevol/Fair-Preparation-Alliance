Phase1: Manual Coordination (Foundational Readiness)  
Phase1 sets the foundation using minimal automation and maximal human coordination. In this phase, FPA runs on human effort, simple tools, and old-fashioned grit. We don’t rely on advanced tech here – we assume it might not be available when “Stuff Hits The Fan” (SHTF). Phase1 is a “basics-first” approach to ensure everyone can operate even if the power’s out and the internet’s gone.  
Bootstrapping the Network: In Phase1 the Alliance grows through word-of-mouth, meetups, and basic communication channels. We establish regional chapters and local squads using whatever is on hand – phone trees, HAM radios, in-person meetings. Every member is expected to operate with paper maps, analog tools, and face-to-face coordination. Digital convenience is a luxury we do not assume. We learn to function offline from day one.
