Each local FPA chapter or group has its own leadership to coordinate activities on the ground. Typically, a Chapter Lead or Coordinator is recognized – someone responsible for organizing meetings, keeping members engaged, and serving as the point of contact with the national leadership. Local leaders are often elected by their members or emerge by consensus based on trust and competence (aligned with the [[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]] – local leaders must have the trust of their peers). In addition to a main coordinator, chapters may assign specific roles such as a Communications Officer (overseeing local comms, e.g. maintaining the chapter’s presence on [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] and organizing ham radio check-ins), a Training or Safety Officer (who runs drills and ensures members follow the [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] and safety protocols), a Quartermaster or Logistics Lead (managing shared resources and [[Resource Management and Logistics]] at the local level), and perhaps a Medical Lead (if someone has medical expertise for first aid preparedness). These roles can be informal and often one person may wear multiple hats in a small chapter, but defining them helps ensure all critical tasks are covered. Local leadership has the autonomy to make quick decisions during emergencies specific to their area (for example, where to establish a rally point or how to respond to a local flood), while staying in communication with regional/national leaders
