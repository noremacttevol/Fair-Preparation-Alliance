**Description:** Establish formal recognition and liaison channels between FPA and government emergency management (FEMA at the federal level and state emergency agencies). This may include signing Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) outlining how FPA squads will cooperate in disasters, having FPA representatives liaise at Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), and ensuring FPA is integrated into the “whole community” response framework. The partnership remains equal – FPA offers manpower and local intel, while FEMA/State offer coordination and resources – without compromising FPA’s independence.
