is needed (like recommending one person take a cooling-off leave, or get specific training, or in extreme cases, be reassigned if they cannot work together). While we try hard to have the actual parties agree on their solution, the panelâ€™s recommendation carries moral weight and is documented. The involved parties are asked to consider the recommendation seriously and come to a final agreement in light of it. Example: The timeline dispute escalated: say one colleague accuses the other of consistently undermining them. A panel of three peers from the circle reviews their work history, finds communication issues on both sides, and recommends a structured workflow with clear roles to prevent future confusion. They also advise the two to attend a conflict resolution refresher workshop. The two colleagues accept this plan, with oversight from the squad lead to ensure compliance. At this point, a formal resolution agreement is noted in writing.
