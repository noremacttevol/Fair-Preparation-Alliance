**Offline-First Communications:** Perhaps one of the most critical operational upgrades is the focus on **offline-first infrastructure** (Chapter 8). Mk1Mod2 relied heavily on internet-based coordination (apps, online forums). But if power or internet failed, communications suffered. In Mk1Mod3, we have engineered an offline-capable communication network using ham radios, local mesh networks, and peer-to-peer apps. The new _Offline-First Infrastructure Blueprint_ provides squads with guidelines to set up battery-backed radios and intranet kits that work without external power or cell towers. The inclusion of ham radio is particularly notable: FPA has partnered with amateur radio clubs to train more operators. When conventional networks go down, ham radio operators can relay information real-time across affected areas. Mesh networking allows text and data to hop between local nodes, so even if one link breaks, the message finds another route. These systems ensure that **when all else fails, FPA members can still communicate** â€“ a drastic improvement from our previous model.
