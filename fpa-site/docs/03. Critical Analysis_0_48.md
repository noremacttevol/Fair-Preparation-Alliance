Legal and Liability Threats: If an FPA operation ever goes awry (for instance, a volunteer gets injured during a response, or bad advice leads to losses), there could be lawsuits or regulatory crackdowns. Governments might impose licensing on giving certain types of aid, or ban civilians from performing quasi-official roles. Ensuring FPA has legal protections – perhaps similar to Good Samaritan laws or by aligning with CERT’s legal framework (CERT volunteers in the U.S. often register with local government to get coverage under liability plans) – will be important. If FPA can’t secure some form of liability protection, the risk of litigation could scare leaders or participants, effectively disrupting the movement.
