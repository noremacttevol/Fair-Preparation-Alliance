filter canisters, hazmat suits or at least rain ponchos as improvised protection, duct tape, and knowledge of decontamination procedures (taking off clothes, washing with soap and water, etc.). They stress information: know the wind patterns in your area (for fallout or gas spread), and have ways to get official alerts (like a NOAA radio). Also, medical: for certain biological threats, having appropriate antibiotics or antivirals, and for chemical, maybe antidotes (like an epinephrine auto-injector for allergic reactions or atropine for nerve agents, though those are prescription). Not everyone will go full hazmat, but FPA ensures at least the plans are discussed and those keen on it help guide others. Some chapters might identify safe spots like tunnels or specific buildings to gather in if nuclear fallout is expected. On an alliance level, they integrate CBRN into their comms drills: e.g., code words for different threat types, so members know to don gear or shelter. They also coordinate with any local authorities because official response can be crucial (like evacuation routes for chemical spills). In summary, FPA’s plan is: Provide knowledge and encourage equipment for CBRN protection at personal and group levels, practice the immediate actions (shelter, seal, evac, decon, etc.), and have a communication and rendezvous strategy to support each other until the threat passes and it’s safe to emerge or return.
