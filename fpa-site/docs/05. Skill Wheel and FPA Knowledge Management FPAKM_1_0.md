The Skill Wheel is a prominent visual element on each member’s profile (visible in the app and printable formats). At the **center of the wheel** is the member’s personal identity: their **badge** (FPA insignia or rank emblem), **rank/title**, and **call sign** (unique identifier or nickname). This central area personalizes the wheel – it’s clearly _their_ readiness profile – and ties into the FPA rank structure (immediately conveying the member’s status in the Alliance).
