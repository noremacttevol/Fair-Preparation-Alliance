1. **Complete Basic Profile:** e.g. confirm name, location, and any critical info. _(This will later feed into personalized content in Phase2+)._  
2. **Join or Form a Squad:** Using their ZIP, the system suggests a nearby [[Squad]] if available. If none exists, they are encouraged to be a founding member and will be connected with others in their region manually. Early squads may be formed by admins pairing users by location until the self-serve squad feature matures.  
3. **Set Up Communications:** Every member receives a **HAM radio setup guide** and is invited to complete their first radio check-in with their squad or mentor. They’re also provided an FPA channel list and a schedule for weekly radio drills. This ensures even in Phase1, each member establishes an **offline comms capability** (critical for the “grid-down” scenario).  
4. **First Drill / Task:** New E-1 members get a small actionable task, like performing a family **“Pulse Check” drill or gear audit**. For example, they might be asked to use the “Test My Plan” scenario feature and share one takeaway on the squad chat. These initial tasks give a _“small win”_ and are celebrated to build motivation (a quick progress boost, even if just 10% readiness) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=many%20users%20initially%20feel%20anxiety,like%20rewards/)). Completion can be logged by an admin or simple form since automation is limited in Phase1.
