Complementing the Bug-Out Bag, FPA also advises members to maintain a Get-Home Bag – a smaller kit intended to help one return home (or to a safe location) if disaster strikes while they’re out. Many people spend a good part of the day at work, school, or on the road, so this kit is often kept in one’s car, office locker, or carried daily if feasible. A Get-Home Bag typically is lighter than a full BOB, built for perhaps 24 hours of support. It includes:  
- Water & Food: a bottle of water (or collapsible bladder) and some high-energy snacks (granola bars, jerky). Possibly a filter straw in case one needs to drink from a stream or public source.  
- Comfortable walking gear: if you normally wear dress shoes or heels, the get-home bag should have a pair of walking shoes and socks. Also seasonally appropriate items like a poncho or sun hat.  
- Navigation & Comms: a map of the local area marking multiple routes home (including on foot routes cutting through if roads are jammed) and a compass. A whistle and small radio (to monitor news or communicate).  
- Personal safety gear: pepper spray or another defensive tool if appropriate, plus a headlamp for moving at night and a reflective vest (so cars see you, or to signal).  
- First Aid & Hygiene: a compact first aid kit for blisters, small injuries, and any needed personal meds (like an inhaler or insulin and snacks for diabetics). Also wet wipes or sanitizer (one might be moving through dust or debris).
