## 7.44 Phase-Specific Gear Adjustments

As situations intensify from Phase 1 to Phase 3, the role and choice of gear can shift, and FPA plans for those transitions:

- Phase 1 (Normal / Blue-Sky): Gear focus is on preparation and training. Members have access to all resources, so they might use power tools to fortify homes, drive supplies to caches, and utilize digital gear for planning. This is when heavy gear (like large solar generators, bulky reference books, etc.) is most available and useful. The priority is staging and readiness: e.g., keeping vehicles fueled, batteries topped off.  
      
    
- Phase 2 (Disrupted / Gray-Sky): Some infrastructure is down. Portable gear becomes crucial. Members break out intermediate solutions: generators for short-term power gaps, portable radios now on constantly, and more robust personal protective gear if danger is rising. They may start carrying their go-bags even within the home or vehicle as uncertainty grows. Gear that bridges gaps (like a camp stove for when the gas is off, or portable water containers to fetch water from elsewhere if taps dry up) comes into play.  
      
    
- Phase 3 (Grid-Down / Black-Sky): Now reliance is entirely on what one has. Simpler, manually-operated gear shines here: hand pumps, solar oven for cooking when fuel is gone, bicycles if vehicles have no fuel. High-tech gear might become bricks if power and comms fail (unless one has solar to keep them). FPA trains to revert to low-tech methods: using paper maps instead of GPS, hand tools instead of power tools, making fires for heat if HVAC is out. Gear usage becomes about conservation: rationing batteries, using multi-use items to the max. Also, Phase 3 might require self-defense gear to be at the ready constantly, whereas in Phase 1 it was stored securely.  
      
    
- Go/No-Go Gear: They identify what gear to jettison as phases change. For instance, in a hasty evacuation (transition to Phase 3 chaos), a member might leave behind non-essentials like heavy luxuries to make room for more water or medical supplies. The Alliance has “last minute lists” for Phase 2 -> 3 transitions: if time allows, grab X (e.g., fill the bathtub with water, take the family photo albums for morale), but if not, stick to the life-sustaining basics.  
    In practice, FPA sometimes runs exercises labeled by phase: a “Phase 3 weekend” where everyone assumes no grid and only uses what they’d have in that scenario – cooking on fires, communicating by radio only, etc. This helps highlight gear gaps and behavioral adjustments. By aligning gear strategy with phases, FPA ensures members maximize the usefulness of their equipment throughout the unfolding of a crisis, neither underutilizing available resources in early stages nor over-relying on things that won’t work in the worst case.
