## 4.20 Communication Gear Maintenance

All the fancy communication plans in the world fail if the devices don’t work. Thus, FPA places importance on regular maintenance of communication gear. This starts with power: members routinely check and charge their radio batteries (and keep spare batteries handy, or employ hand-crank/solar chargers from their [[7.30 Power & Charging]] kits). Radios and sat devices are tested periodically to ensure they’re functional; a radio that’s been sitting in a closet might need its contacts cleaned or firmware updated. Antennas are inspected – a loose antenna connector or frayed cable can greatly reduce range, so members learn how to properly connect and even build or repair simple antennas. The Alliance might organize a “communications gear day” as part of a meeting where everyone brings their devices and they collectively test them, update frequency lists, and do any tuning required. Waterproofing and ruggedization is considered too: critical devices are kept in protective cases or bags, with silica gel to avoid moisture damage. Additionally, FPA encourages members to have analog backups for modern gear: for instance, having a paper list of frequencies and important phone numbers (in case a phone’s battery dies and you can’t access your contacts list electronically). Members keep their devices labeled with their name/contact so lost items can be returned at gatherings. By treating radios, phones, and other communicators as vital equipment that needs care (just like one would maintain a car or a generator), the Alliance ensures that when the moment comes to use them under duress, they will perform reliably. A well-maintained $30 walkie-talkie can end up being a lifesaver if it’s the only link—so they treat it with the respect and upkeep any life-safety tool deserves.
