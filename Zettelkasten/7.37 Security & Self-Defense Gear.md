## 7.37 Security & Self-Defense Gear

FPA’s stance on security is to be prepared for the possibility of threats (looters, wildlife, etc.) while prioritizing de-escalation and safety. Gear in this category may vary widely due to personal choice and legalities, but commonly includes:

- Locks & Barriers: Additional padlocks, chains, and door reinforcement bars to secure property. Some members carry portable door locks or wedges when sheltering in an unknown location (to prevent entry).  
      
    
- Non-lethal tools: Pepper spray is widely carried for personal defense (against humans or aggressive dogs). Some have tasers or stun batons if legal. High-powered tactical flashlights can disorient threats at night.  
      
    
- Defensive Firearms: Many chapters include members who are trained and licensed to carry firearms. The Alliance neither mandates nor forbids guns; it stresses training, safe handling, and secure storage if one chooses this route. Those who do often coordinate on common calibers and types (e.g., a 9mm pistol for personal defense, a shotgun or rifle at home). Along with firearms come necessary accessories: cleaning kits, plenty of ammunition in waterproof storage, holsters, and safes. Importantly, FPA holds range days to maintain proficiency and has clear rules of engagement focusing on defense of life.  
      
    
- Edged/Impact Weapons: Some carry knives not just as tools but for last-resort defense. A few may have machetes or collapsible batons, again where legal. Even a sturdy hiking staff can serve as protection against animals.  
      
    
- Body Armor: Rare but a few have soft armor vests or rifle-rated plates, particularly if they volunteer in disaster areas with civil unrest potential. Helmets (like surplus military or construction hard hats) can protect from thrown debris or other impact threats.  
      
    
- Alarm Systems: Tripwire alarms, driveway alarms, or even a simple can-on-a-string noise maker can be part of a cache to set up around a perimeter to get early warning of intruders.  
    The Alliance also emphasizes that self-defense also includes situational awareness and communication – hence all the focus on radios and signaling. By having security gear and the training to use it, members add a layer of protection for themselves and their families. It’s always coupled with good judgement: avoidance of conflict is the first goal, use of force is last resort. But if law enforcement is stretched thin, FPA’s security preparations help ensure the group can protect its people and resources from harm until order is restored.
