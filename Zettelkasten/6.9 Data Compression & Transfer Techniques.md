## 6.9 Data Compression & Transfer Techniques

In low-bandwidth situations, the Alliance has innovated ways to compress and transfer data efficiently. One simple practice is mastering efficient file formats: for example, using text-only documents or ultra-compressed images (like black-and-white, low-resolution) when sharing over radio or mesh to minimize size. FPA’s tech team explores compression algorithms that work well on small processors – if they need to send a few pages of text via Morse code or other means, they might compress it into a ZIP or use an encoding scheme to shorten it before transmission, then decode on the other end. Another technique is burst transmission: sending data in quick, high-speed bursts to reduce on-air time. An innovation here is using audio coupler and acoustic methods: imagine playing a sound (that represents data, like old dial-up modems or SSTV images) over a radio or even a phone call. FPA has tried sending small files by literally holding a radio near a computer speaker playing a modem tone – crude but it can work without specialized gear. On the digital side, they employ forward error correction and chunking so that if some parts of a file drop, they can reconstruct it from redundancies. One favorite tool is ITU-T.18 fax over radio or newer digital fax/image modes to send printed info as an image if digital text is too complex. The Alliance also experiments with sneakernet optimization – for instance, using QR codes or short URLs printed on paper that can encode surprising amounts of data (like a big QR code can hold a few kilobytes), effectively sending data on physical paper which can then be scanned to retrieve the digital info. All these clever methods mean that even if they have to transfer a crucial PDF manual or a coordinate list with very limited connection, they’ve thought of ways to squeeze it through. It showcases FPA’s ethos of resourcefulness: acknowledging that in constrained environments, data is precious and innovation means making every bit count.
