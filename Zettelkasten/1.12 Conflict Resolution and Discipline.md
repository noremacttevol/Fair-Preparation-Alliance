## 1.12 Conflict Resolution and Discipline

  

In any group, conflicts can arise – FPA addresses them through a fair, structured process. Conflict resolution is usually attempted at the lowest level first: if two members have a disagreement (say over resource sharing or personality clash), the expectation is that they attempt to resolve it face-to-face in a respectful manner, referencing the [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] and core values to find common ground. Often a local leader or a mutually respected member will facilitate a mediation, ensuring each side is heard. The emphasis is on communication and empathy – since all members share the same mission, resolving interpersonal issues is framed as crucial for group survival. If a conflict cannot be resolved informally, it is escalated to chapter leadership or a small “council” of peers for arbitration. For example, if someone accuses another of not following OPSEC (like possibly leaking info), the chapter lead may convene a meeting with those involved to examine evidence and decide on a resolution. Throughout, the Trust Doctrine is a guide – breaches of trust are seen as serious but potentially recoverable if addressed openly and corrected. Disciplinary actions come into play if a member violates rules or endangers the group. Minor issues (e.g., a member consistently showing up late to drills or neglecting tasks) might result in a friendly reprimand or temporary suspension of certain privileges (maybe not being included in a sensitive plan until they demonstrate reliability). Serious violations – such as theft from another member, deliberate violation of privacy rules, chronic disruptive behavior, or confirmed sharing of group secrets – trigger more formal discipline. FPA’s procedure for serious cases often involves the local leadership plus a representative from the national council reviewing the case. If the person is found at fault, consequences can include probation (where their involvement is limited and they must re-earn trust), removal from leadership roles, or in worst cases expulsion from FPA. Expulsion is rare and treated carefully, as it means cutting off someone who may know group info; typically the group will do so only if absolutely necessary for safety. When a member is expelled or leaves on bad terms, other members are notified discreetly and any keys, access, or sensitive info the person had are changed (security precaution). Importantly, FPA aims to handle discipline quietly and respectfully – they avoid public shaming, understanding that how they treat exiting members will reflect on the group’s integrity. Many minor conflicts are actually defused by proactive measures: clear [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] upfront, consistent leadership behavior, and promoting friendship and understanding through regular [[Member Meetings and Events]]. Thus, formal discipline is infrequent. When everyone buys into FPA’s mission and values, conflicts are resolved with the shared goal in mind: keeping the Alliance strong and united.
