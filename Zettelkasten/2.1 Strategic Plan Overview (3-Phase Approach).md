## 2.1 Strategic Plan Overview (3-Phase Approach)

  

FPA’s overall strategy is structured into three phases, each representing a stage of development and action as situations escalate. This phased approach, outlined in the Mark I Mod III Framework ([[Mark I Mod III Framework (Current Plan)]]), allows the Alliance to grow and adapt systematically. Phase 1 is the current (pre-crisis) phase: focus is on organization and preparation during “normal” times. In Phase 1, FPA recruits members, establishes local chapters, conducts training, and quietly builds the foundation – this includes knowledge gathering (creating the [[“Whole Book” Master Documentation]] and [[“SHTF Bible” Comprehensive Manual]]), compiling resources like the [[Approved Gear List Overview]], and fostering trust among members ([[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]]). Communication in Phase 1 relies on existing infrastructure (internet, phones), with plans to transition later ([[Current Communication Channels (Phase 1)]]). Phase 2 is activated as a crisis onset or deteriorating conditions phase: when significant disruptions occur (widespread disaster, grid-down scenarios, or rising societal chaos), FPA shifts to implementing independent systems and networked mutual aid. Key elements of Phase 2 include deploying the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] – a dedicated comms network to maintain contact when mainstream channels fail – and ramping up coordinated support: members share resources more actively, rally at predetermined safe points ([[Rally Points and Evacuation Plans]]), and initiate mutual aid protocols ([[Mutual Aid Among Members]]). Phase 2 is about survival and continuity; FPA operates as an independent support system, often in parallel to or filling gaps left by official emergency response. Phase 3 is envisioned as the post-crisis outreach and rebuilding phase: once immediate survival is secured, FPA leverages its organization to help rebuild community resilience and spread vital information. A hallmark of Phase 3 is the [[Outernet (Phase 3 Media Layer)]] – a podcasting/broadcasting and entertainment layer that sits atop Realnet to deliver news, education, and morale-boosting content to surviving communities. During Phase 3, FPA may engage more openly with non-members to foster recovery (for instance, hosting community barter markets, aiding reconstruction projects, or broadening the alliance to include more of the public who have now seen the value of preparedness). Throughout all phases, many fundamentals remain constant (training, ethical conduct, trust). Transition triggers between phases are clearly defined in FPA’s playbook. For example, a Phase 2 trigger might be a “Black Sky Event” (total grid failure) or declaration of martial law – events that indicate it’s time to activate the Realnet and emergency plans. The strategy also allows moving back if things stabilize (though generally once progressed, they assume a new normal). This multi-phase plan ensures FPA doesn’t prematurely expose itself (staying mostly covert in Phase 1) but is ready to act decisively when needed. Each member is briefed on the overall plan in broad strokes during [[Onboarding New Members]] so they know the big picture: prepare now quietly, stand ready to activate our network in a crisis, and aim to help rebuild a fair, prepared society afterward. This shared strategic vision aligns all activities under a common roadmap. (Detailed breakdowns: see [[Phase 1: Early Organization & Preparedness]], [[Phase 2: Network Expansion & Communications]], and [[Phase 3: Outreach & Community Resilience]] notes for specifics of each phase.)
