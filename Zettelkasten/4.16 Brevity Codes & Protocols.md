## 4.16 Brevity Codes & Protocols

To streamline communications, FPA employs a set of brevity codes and protocols that all members learn. Brevity codes are short words or abbreviations used to convey complex messages quickly. For example, “ACK” might be used in text or voice to mean “Acknowledged,” or radio Q-codes like “QTH” to ask for location in ham radio contexts. The group also might create its own short codes for internal use, such as “PRONTO” to indicate an urgent message or “ALL-CALL” to indicate everyone should listen up. Additionally, standard protocols borrowed from emergency services are practiced: using “CLEAR TEXT” (plain language without 10-codes on public channels to avoid confusion), saying “Over” to yield the mic on radio, or saying “Break, Break” to interrupt with emergency traffic. There might be a protocol for relaying messages: e.g., if a member hears a call but the intended recipient didn’t, they act as relay and pass it along, indicating “This is [Name], relaying for [Other Name]…”. In written communication like email or SMS, FPA might use prefixes in subject lines like “[URGENT]” or “[UPDATE]” to categorize messages. All these conventions are documented in a quick-reference sheet stored in both the physical handbook and the knowledge base. By using agreed-upon codes and protocols, the Alliance minimizes misunderstandings and speeds up communication—especially crucial when bandwidth or time is limited. Everyone knows that “RCV” in a text stands for “Received” or that a double click of a radio mic can mean affirmation. Such little efficiencies, consistently applied, improve overall coordination and effectiveness.
