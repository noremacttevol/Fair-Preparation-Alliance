## 2.8 Training and Skills Development Program

  

Training is the backbone of FPA’s effectiveness. The Alliance runs a continuous Skills Development Program to ensure all members are competent in key areas and that specialized skills are distributed across the network. Early in Phase 1, each member’s skills and gaps are identified (recorded in the [[Member Skills Directory]]). From there, FPA encourages a structured learning path. Core Training Modules: Every member is expected to attain proficiency in a core set of skills. These typically include first aid and trauma care (from basic CPR to wound management), land navigation with map and compass (in case GPS fails), radio communication basics (operating a ham/FRS radio properly, using proper net etiquette as per [[Ham Radio Network]] practices), fire-starting and basic shelter building (for wilderness survival), water purification methods, and basic self-defense techniques. FPA often conducts workshops or courses on these topics, sometimes taught by members with expertise (a member who’s an EMT might teach first aid, a military veteran might teach land nav and defense). Advanced/Specialized Training: Members also pursue areas of personal strength or interest that benefit the group. For instance, some may train in advanced radio operations (learning to set up field antennas or packet radio for Realnet nodes), some in gardening/agriculture (for long-term food security, which they share knowledge about), others in mechanical repair or electrical systems (to maintain generators, solar panels, vehicles). These members become go-to resources in crises. FPA has a mentorship system ([[Mentorship and Peer Support]]) where those with advanced skills coach others. Cross-Training: To prevent reliance on one person, critical skills are cross-trained. If only one medic is in the chapter, at least two others will train to intermediate medical level. If one person handles all comms, others are taught to fill in. Cross-training is often done via paired learning (buddy teams learn each other’s specialties). Regular Drills and Exercises: The program isn’t just classroom-style learning; it emphasizes practical drills (see [[Drills and Simulations]]). E.g., a weekend field exercise might require members to navigate to a point, set up camp, treat a simulated injury, and communicate back to base – integrating multiple skills under realistic conditions. After drills, instructors or experienced members provide feedback and additional training on any weak points observed. Use of AI and Modern Tools: The training program may incorporate tools from the [[AI in Member Training and Education]] note – for example, using an AI-based quiz system for members to test their knowledge on medical procedures or using scenario simulations to test decision-making. However, FPA ensures AI is an aid, not a crutch (members still practice hands-on). Training Materials: FPA’s knowledge management provides abundant resources – e.g., chapters from the SHTF Bible on various skills are assigned as reading. The Alliance also curates external resources (like CERT manuals, military survival guide excerpts, ham radio study guides) and makes them available. Some members pursue official certifications (CERT, amateur radio license, Wilderness First Responder, etc.) during Phase 1 for personal achievement and then share that knowledge. Progression and Assessment: To maintain standards, FPA does periodic assessments. For example, every six months a chapter might organize a skill assessment day – run through first aid scenarios, target practice at the range (if applicable and legal), and a short navigation course. Weaknesses are noted and extra training sessions arranged. The atmosphere is supportive – the goal is improvement, not punishment. Knowledge Sharing Culture: Members are encouraged to teach what they learn. If someone attends an external course (like a permaculture workshop or an advanced firearm tactics class), they return and present key lessons to the group. This multiplies expertise without everyone attending everything. Phase 2 Adaptation: During crisis, training doesn’t stop; it adapts to circumstances. Members continue to learn on the job, and experienced members rotate to ensure less-experienced ones are paired with them in tasks (so learning continues under pressure). Debriefings after events double as training moments – “this is what we did right/wrong and how to do better next time.” Overall, FPA’s training program aims to make each member a well-rounded prepper and to collectively have depth in every crucial skill. It transforms a collection of individuals into a skilled team that can handle a wide array of challenges. As a result, FPA members often become community experts in emergencies – even outside of FPA operations, they can lend a hand, which further solidifies the value of the Alliance’s training ethos.
