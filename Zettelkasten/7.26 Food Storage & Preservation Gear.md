## 7.26 Food Storage & Preservation Gear

To manage food supplies and prevent spoilage, FPA employs various storage and preservation tools:

- Mylar bags & O2 absorbers: For long-term storage of dry goods (grains, beans, pasta), sealed in buckets. Members often DIY-pack staples this way for 5+ year shelf life.  
      
    
- Vacuum sealers: Used during normal times to package dehydrated foods or jerky. A manual vacuum pump device is kept if power is out.  
      
    
- Canning equipment: Pressure canners and water-bath canners, jars, lids, and rings – so surplus from a garden or bulk meat can be preserved in jars. Many have recipes and experience with canning soups, vegetables, etc.  
      
    
- Dehydrator or solar dryer: Electric dehydrators for peacetime (with a generator backup) and solar drying racks for grid-down. This helps preserve fruits, make raisins, dry meats into jerky.  
      
    
- Coolers/root storage: Large insulated coolers (with ice making plan via generator or dry ice) can keep fridge items for a short term outage. Also, some set up a root cellar or at least cold storage bins in the ground to use earth’s cooling for produce and canned food longevity.  
      
    
- Pest-proof containers: Metal bins or food-grade barrels to keep rodents and insects out. This includes gamma-seal lids for buckets that are frequently accessed.  
    With these, FPA households can extend the edibility of their food far beyond normal shelf lives and ensure that even without refrigeration, they can stockpile and safely consume food over long periods.
