## 4.6 Amateur (Ham) Radio

Ham radio is the backbone of long-range emergency communication for the Alliance. FPA strongly encourages members to obtain at least a Technician-class amateur radio license, which unlocks access to a variety of VHF/UHF frequencies and repeaters. Licensed ham operators in the group often serve as communicators who can link different chapters by radio when phone/Internet is down. With ham radio, members can send messages across town or even across regions (especially using HF bands for long-distance if they have a General-class license and appropriate equipment). FPA maintains a list of go-to frequencies (and backup frequencies) for ham nets during emergencies, and may coordinate with local Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) nets or community emergency nets for broader situational awareness. Training is provided on how to use common equipment like handheld VHF radios (HTs), mobile units, and base stations, including how to program frequencies and how to use repeaters properly (identifying with call sign, following the repeater’s courtesy tones, etc.). Ham operators also experiment with data modes (like sending emails via Winlink or text via APRS). The power of ham radio is its reach and reliability – FPA’s ham network means even if an entire city loses power and comms, there’s likely a radio link carrying member check-ins or relaying a call for help to a different area that can still assist or send information.
