## 1.10 Accountability and Transparency

  

Accountability within FPA ensures that leaders and members alike are answerable for their actions and decisions, maintaining trust in the organization. At the leadership level, transparency measures are in place: the National Leadership Council provides regular updates to the membership on Alliance status – for example, publishing after-action reports on major drills (what went well, what needs improvement) and disclosing any significant decisions or changes in plans (like updates to the [[Mark I Mod III Framework (Current Plan)]]) to all members via the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] or meetings. Financial or resource usage (to the extent the Alliance has pooled resources or funds) is also transparent: if funds are collected for a group purchase of gear or a project, a summary of how it was spent is shared, to avoid any suspicion of misuse. Member accountability is reinforced through peer evaluation and the Trust Doctrine: members hold each other accountable by noting if someone consistently misses commitments or violates guidelines, which is then addressed in a constructive manner (maybe through a quiet word or a review by chapter leadership). There are established processes for dealing with issues – for example, a member who continually breaks the [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] or fails to fulfill their role (such as a local comms officer not running scheduled [[Communication Drills and Exercises]]) can be gently reassigned or, if necessary, removed from that responsibility in favor of someone more reliable ([[Disciplinary Actions and Removal]] covers serious cases). FPA’s culture encourages open communication up and down the chain: members should feel comfortable asking leaders for rationale behind decisions (why are we doing X), and leaders are expected to explain (without breaching any needed OPSEC). In meetings or on internal forums, constructive criticism is welcomed. For example, after a training event, members might openly discuss what leadership could have done better, and leadership will acknowledge valid points. This feedback loop is formalized in some chapters with periodic “hotwash” sessions (post-exercise debriefs) and suggestion channels ([[Member Feedback and Involvement in Decisions]] is part of governance). By having these accountability and transparency practices, FPA ensures that power is not abused and that the Alliance continuously self-corrects. It reinforces trust – everyone knows that secret agendas or freeloading won’t be allowed to fester.
