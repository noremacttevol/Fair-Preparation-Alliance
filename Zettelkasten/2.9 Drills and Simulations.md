## 2.9 Drills and Simulations

  

Practical drills are a core part of FPA’s preparedness regimen, translating plans on paper into tested action. The Alliance regularly conducts simulations of emergency scenarios to evaluate readiness and improve coordination. These drills vary in scope and complexity:

  

Communication Drills: On a scheduled basis (e.g., weekly or monthly), chapters practice emergency comms. A typical drill might involve a sudden “comms blackout” scenario where members must reach each other using only radios. They practice initiating a net on the primary channel, relaying messages, and using backup methods if someone doesn’t respond (like driving to check on them). These exercises refine use of the [[Ham Radio Network]] and Realnet protocols and ensure everyone knows their call signs and code words ([[Communication Drills and Exercises]] and [[Emergency Frequencies and Channels]] tie in here).

  

Bug-Out Drills: The chapter is instructed that at a certain time (perhaps unannounced for realism), they must simulate evacuating. Members grab their go-bags and travel to a designated rally point or safehouse. This tests their personal preparedness (was the go-bag complete and easy to grab? how long did it take to mobilize?) and the viability of their routes (did anyone hit unexpected obstacles or traffic?). After the drill, they discuss what items they forgot or what issues they encountered. These drills reinforce the plans made in [[Rally Points and Evacuation Plans]].

  

Shelter-in-Place Drills: Conversely, a scenario could be practiced where everyone must lock down at home (for example, a pandemic simulation). They would go through the motions of sealing the house if needed, living off stored supplies for 24-48 hours, and checking in via comms without physically meeting. This tests if their home preps are sufficient and if boredom or minor issues crop up that weren’t anticipated (like needing a way to cook when power is out).

  

Field Exercise (“Bug-Out Camp”): Some chapters do an annual camp-out that doubles as a survival exercise. Members go to a remote area with their gear and simulate that their town became unsafe. Over a weekend, they practice building a group camp, purifying water from natural sources, rotating sentry duty at night ([[Physical Security Measures]] in action), and dealing with injected scenarios (leaders might surprise them with a mock “injury” to treat or a “lost person” scenario to search for). This kind of immersive drill builds confidence and identifies gaps in group logistics (maybe they realize they need better shelter solutions or more water carriers).

  

Medical Emergencies: The group may stage a medical emergency drill. For example, one member acts out a serious injury or illness during a meeting or exercise. The others must respond: provide first aid, call for help (or simulate no external help available, meaning they must rely on their skills), and decide on evacuation. This tests the [[Emergency Medical Preparedness]] training and the availability of first aid gear. It also reveals leadership under pressure – who takes charge, how effectively do they communicate.

  

“Test My Plan” Simulations: The formal [[“Test My Plan” Program]] often runs as a structured drill. A member volunteers their personal emergency plan to be tested by the group. The group then throws a hypothetical crisis at that member (e.g., a wildfire approaching their home) and the member executes their plan: contacting who they said they would, packing what they planned, etc., while others observe or role-play needed roles (like a neighbor or a family member). The group then provides feedback – maybe the member forgot an essential item or the evacuation route was clogged. This helps refine individual plans and also educates everyone on diverse scenarios.

  

Joint Drills with Allies: In some cases, FPA might coordinate a drill with a friendly neighboring prepper group or CERT team (keeping OPSEC, the scenario is usually generic). For example, a citywide “grid-down weekend” where multiple groups attempt to operate without power or communications and then meet for a debrief. This can broaden experience and reveal how FPA might interface with non-members in a real event.

During all drills, realism vs safety is balanced. Members know it’s a drill (unless leadership announces a surprise, but even then, safe words or channels exist to avoid panic). Safety protocols are observed (no live firearms use in drills beyond normal range practice, no actual dangerous fire starting except in controlled environment, etc.). The aim is to stretch comfort zones but not to endanger anyone.

After each simulation, thorough debriefs are held. Members discuss what went well and what failed. These debrief notes are recorded (contributing to [[Continuous Improvement and AARs]]). For instance, a drill might reveal that not everyone had the updated radio frequency list, prompting an action item to print and distribute wallet cards with frequencies. Or it could show that a particular family struggled because their children weren’t briefed on the plan, highlighting a need for more family-inclusive training (leading to something like a family preparedness workshop).

Over time, the frequency and intensity of drills keeps members sharp. It also builds trust – having “been through” a tough simulation together, members gain confidence in each other’s abilities. By Phase 2, many actions will feel almost like second nature because they were rehearsed. FPA’s philosophy is practice now so we perform well later. Even seemingly small exercises, like a surprise evening “text tree” test to see how fast information cascades, contribute to this readiness. The Alliance treats drills not as occasional chores but as a core part of membership life – often they manage to make them engaging, even fun, while still educational. (Cross-ref: [[Training and Skills Development Program]] ensures members have skills to apply in drills, and [[Psychological Preparedness and Morale]] benefits from the confidence built in simulations.)
