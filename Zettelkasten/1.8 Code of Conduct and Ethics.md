## 1.8 Code of Conduct and Ethics

  

FPA maintains a Code of Conduct that all members are expected to follow, ensuring ethical behavior and a safe, respectful community. This code is essentially the practical extension of FPA’s values ([[Core Values and Principles]]) and [[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]]. Key points in the code include: (1) Respect and Non-Discrimination: Members must treat each other with respect regardless of background, skills, or beliefs. Harassment, bigotry, or exclusionary behavior is not tolerated (see [[Diversity and Inclusion]]). (2) Confidentiality: Members should keep sensitive information within the group – e.g., details of others’ supplies, plans, or identities are not to be shared outside without permission, aligning with [[Operational Security (OPSEC) Measures]]. (3) Integrity: Lying, stealing, or any form of exploitation within the group is strictly forbidden. For instance, taking advantage of another member’s resources without reciprocation violates both ethics and the [[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]]. (4) Legal and Ethical Preparedness: The code insists that members acquire and use skills and gear legally and responsibly – for example, any firearms possessed are legal and handled safely ([[Self-Defense and Firearms Training]] covers safe use), and members will not plan illegal activities. (5) Aid and Dependability: In line with fairness, if one member commits to help another (such as participating in a [[“Test My Plan” Program]] review or responding to a local emergency), they are expected to follow through barring extreme circumstances. The code also covers interpersonal conduct: encouraging constructive communication, forbidding spreading false rumors (see [[Information Verification and Rumor Control]]), and requiring that conflicts be addressed maturely ([[Conflict Resolution and Discipline]] provides mechanisms). Breaches of the code of conduct result in a review by leadership and could lead to sanctions or expulsion ([[Disciplinary Actions and Removal]]). This ethical code is provided during [[Onboarding New Members]] and members often reaffirm it regularly (sometimes in annual meet-ups or in the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] forum as a pinned post). By upholding this code, FPA ensures a trustworthy, honorable community that stands in contrast to the “every person for themselves” mentality – it’s a key reason why preppers choose to join the Alliance. (Related: [[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]] for philosophical underpinning, [[Member Meetings and Events]] where code is discussed, and [[Legal and Ethical Compliance]] for broader societal/legal context.)
