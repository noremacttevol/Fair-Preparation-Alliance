## 4.14 Sneakernet & Physical Message Relay

When electronic communication is impossible or unsecure, FPA falls back on one of the oldest networking methods: physical delivery of messages, often jokingly called “sneakernet.” This could be as simple as pen-and-paper notes or USB flash drives carried by people moving between locations. The Alliance has plans for establishing message drop points, like a community bulletin board or a hidden waterproof tube at a known waypoint, where members can leave status updates or requests for others traveling through. In a dense urban setting, this may mean pre-selecting friendly locations (homes of members or allied community centers) to serve as “post offices” during a communication blackout. Runners or couriers are designated when possible: for example, if two chapters are separated by a few miles and neither has radio contact, a volunteer bicyclist might shuttle between them daily with written reports. Data can also be transported – members might download or save news articles, maps, or emails onto a USB drive and physically hand it off to share information (this is effectively carrying the internet data over sneaker-net). While slow, these methods circumvent any technological dependency; they are also relatively secure from eavesdropping (though physical interception is a risk, hence messages might be encoded or sealed). FPA includes instructions in its training for creating clear, concise written reports (so that even via paper, information is formatted readably, e.g., using a standard situation report template). This commitment to physical relay ensures that even in the absolute worst-case scenario of being totally off-grid, the alliance can still coordinate and inform through human messengers.
