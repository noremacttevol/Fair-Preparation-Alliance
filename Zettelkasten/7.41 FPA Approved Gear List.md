## 7.41 FPA Approved Gear List

Through collective experience, the Alliance has developed an “FPA Approved Gear List” – a list of vetted items that have proven reliable and cost-effective. This list helps members (especially newcomers) avoid trial-and-error with critical gear. It covers categories like:

- Water Filters: e.g., “Sawyer Squeeze” and “Berkey” for home use are on the list after testing flow rate and longevity.  
      
    
- Radios: recommended models of HAM/GMRS handhelds that most use, for easy programming and part swaps (like Baofeng UV-5R or Wouxun models, including programming cable info).  
      
    
- Generators: specific inverter generator models that are quiet and fuel-efficient which the group has used successfully.  
      
    
- First Aid Kits: either a commercial kit brand that FPA supplements or a detailed list to DIY assemble one, which meets certain standards (like Adventure Medical Kits with added tourniquets).  
      
    
- Multitools/Knives: Brands like Leatherman (e.g., Wave model) and Morakniv companion knives made the list due to durability and value.  
      
    
- Solar Panels: a certain folding panel and charge controller combo that members found user-friendly and robust.  
      
    
- Backpacks and Totes: tested packs for BOBs that withstand heavy use, and waterproof totes for cache storage that sealed best.  
      
    
- Protective Gear: e.g., a specific work glove that lasted longest, a headlamp brand with good runtime, etc.  
    The list is updated as gear improves or new items prove themselves. It’s not mandatory to only use those items, but strongly suggested to save time and money. Often, FPA coordinates group buys or discounts for items on the list, leveraging bulk purchase or affiliate deals. The Approved Gear List is published on internal sites and taught in workshops – they even have “gear show-and-tell” at meetings where listed items are demonstrated. This curated list comes from field data: members report back on performance in drills or actual events (e.g., “our recommended tent withstood that storm great, but those cheap stakes bent – we’ll note to upgrade them”). By following the Approved List, members equip themselves with trusted gear, streamlining preparation and ensuring interoperability. It embodies the alliance’s principle of sharing knowledge – here, hard-won knowledge about what equipment can be depended upon when lives may depend on it.
