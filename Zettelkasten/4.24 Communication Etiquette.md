## 4.24 Communication Etiquette

Clear and courteous communication can make a significant difference in an emergency, so FPA emphasizes proper communication etiquette across all channels. On radio, this means observing protocols like not interrupting unless it’s urgent, using “Over” and “Out” correctly (or plain language equivalents) to avoid confusion, and acknowledging messages promptly so the sender knows they were heard. Members are reminded to stay calm and speak slowly and clearly especially when stressed – a panicked rush can garble a message when clarity is needed most. Overlap is avoided: if two people start talking at once, one yields. In group texts or chats, etiquette might include keeping messages concise and on-topic during a crisis (e.g., no unnecessary chatter that can drown out critical info, use threads or separate channels for side conversations). Respect is key: no yelling at someone over the radio, no ALL CAPS in text unless it’s a known format for an alert. When communicating with outside responders or other groups, members are taught to be professional and polite, identifying themselves and their group as appropriate, and expressing thanks for any information or assistance. In the heat of the moment, tempers and anxieties run high, but FPA’s culture of etiquette helps maintain order. For example, they might have a rule: if someone is giving instructions on the net, everyone else holds transmissions unless it’s an emergency. By practicing these behaviors in drills, it becomes second nature to communicate respectfully and effectively. Good etiquette prevents misunderstandings, saves time, and fosters an environment where everyone feels heard and valued – crucial factors for keeping the team united and efficient under pressure.
