## 6.3 Outernet – One-Way Info Broadcast

The "Outernet" refers to a one-way information broadcast system – essentially an internet in broadcast form that doesn’t require a traditional online connection. In FPA’s context, Outernet is about receiving data (news, weather updates, maps, educational content) via methods like satellite or radio waves that continuously transmit files and information. One real-world example is the Othernet project (formerly called Outernet) which uses satellites to beam down a constant stream of data that anyone with a small receiver and antenna can capture. For FPA, the Outernet concept is attractive because it means even if the internet is down, members could still get outside world information: think of receiving Wikipedia articles, emergency alerts, or PDFs of medical texts from space, for free, and anonymously. The setup usually involves a portable satellite receiver (often a lightweight dish or patch antenna and a receiver board) and a computer or tablet to store and display the incoming files. It’s passive and resilient – since it’s one-way, it’s not jammed by local outages and doesn’t reveal the receiver’s location (useful for privacy or in hostile environments). FPA might deploy Outernet kits in each chapter: a small box that, when powered (perhaps by solar), constantly updates a cache of useful data for the group to use. Outernet is inherently global and wide-reaching; whatever central uplink is curating the content can send survival information, news from other regions, or encryption keys, etc., and all subscribers capture it. By embracing Outernet, FPA ensures that even if they become isolated from the traditional web, they still have a window to the world’s knowledge and news – a critical morale and intelligence asset in long-term crises.
