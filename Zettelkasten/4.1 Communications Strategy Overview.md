## 4.1 Communications Strategy Overview

FPA’s communications strategy is built on redundancy, clarity, and resilience. This means the Alliance employs multiple channels (cellular, radio, satellite, etc.) so if one fails, others are available ([[4.19 Multi-Modal Redundancy]]). The strategy is clearly outlined and known to all members: in an emergency, they know which method to try first, and what to try next if that fails. Regular times or triggers for communication are established – for instance, a standard check-in every evening during a crisis. Simplicity is valued to reduce confusion; plain language and agreed codes are used as needed. Overall, the communications strategy ensures that whether it’s blue-sky days or black-sky events, members have a plan to stay in touch, coordinate actions, and share critical information efficiently.
