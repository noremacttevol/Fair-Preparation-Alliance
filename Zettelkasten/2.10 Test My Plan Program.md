## 2.10 "Test My Plan" Program

  

“Test My Plan” is an FPA initiative designed to rigorously evaluate and improve individual members’ emergency plans through collective feedback and simulation. The premise is that every member or family in FPA should have a personalized plan for likely scenarios (house fire, evacuation from city, sheltering during a storm, etc.), and rather than leave those plans untested until a real crisis, FPA conducts structured “dry runs” with the help of fellow members. Here’s how the program typically works: a member volunteers their plan for testing (often one scenario at a time, like “my fire evacuation plan” or “my plan for a two-week grid outage”). They share the outline of their plan with a small Plan Review Team – usually 2-4 other FPA members who are briefed as evaluators. These reviewers look for obvious gaps or issues first on paper, then the real test begins. Simulated Activation: At an unannounced time (to mimic the unexpected nature of emergencies), the Plan Review Team or chapter leadership will initiate the scenario for the volunteer. For example, they might send a coded message or call: “Test My Plan: House Fire.” Upon receiving this, the member knows to treat it as if their house were on fire at that moment. They then go through the motions: ensuring family is alerted (perhaps actually doing a fire drill with their household), grabbing their go-bag, and executing their evacuation route to their designated safe spot (like a neighbor’s yard or a specific street corner). Reviewers might observe discreetly or accompany (if safety allows) to time how long it took and note any difficulties (car wouldn’t start promptly, a pet was hard to gather, etc.). In cases where actual movement isn’t practical (say the plan is for a pandemic lockdown), the test may be table-top: the member describes step by step what they would do, and reviewers challenge them with “what if” injects (e.g., “what if cell networks are down, how do you contact relatives?”). Feedback and Iteration: After the test, the reviewers sit down with the member and discuss. They might ask: Did you remember to take all important items (check against what the member said was in their plan)? How did children react? Was the chosen meetup spot reachable in the expected time? Was any critical step missed (like forgetting to shut off utilities)? Often, reviewers, drawing from their own experience or FPA guidelines, will suggest improvements: maybe the member realized they hadn’t accounted for bad weather during evacuation, or their go-bag was too heavy to carry quickly. Those points are noted. The member then updates their plan accordingly – perhaps splitting items into a lighter “grab-first” bag and secondary bin, or choosing an alternate route that avoids a now-noticed choke point. The plan can be re-tested in a future cycle until both the member and reviewers are confident in it. Group Learning: The benefits of Test My Plan extend beyond the individual. With permission, lessons from these plan tests are anonymized and shared with the chapter. For example, “One family learned their backup batteries were drained when we simulated a power outage – reminder to all: check your battery stores regularly.” In this way, everyone learns from each test, not just the participant. It often sparks members to go home and double-check aspects of their own plan they hadn’t considered. Diversity of Scenarios: Members are encouraged to test various scenarios over time: evacuation (fire, chemical spill, etc.), home defense (what to do if intruders approach – albeit this is discussed rather than enacted for safety), communications blackout (how to gather info and reach out), medical emergency at home, etc. Each scenario reveals different weaknesses. FPA also encourages families to involve all members in their household for these tests – spouses, kids – so that everyone practices together. Supportive Environment: Crucially, the program is not about shaming anyone for an imperfect plan, but about improvement and confidence-building. The atmosphere is kept constructive. For instance, if a member forgot an important document in the rush, the feedback is framed like “It’s easy to miss things under stress – maybe put a checklist by your exit door or copies of documents in your go-bag in advance.” Over time, participants often feel much more prepared and less anxious after having effectively “lived” parts of their plan and refined them. Integration with Overall Strategy: The Test My Plan exercises also ensure individual plans mesh with FPA’s group plans. If one member’s plan was to drive north to a cabin, but FPA’s rally point is south, that’s a conflict – through discussion, they might adjust so that after an initial personal safety step, they link up with the group. It aligns personal and collective strategies. In summary, “Test My Plan” turns abstract preparedness into practice, tapping the power of peer review and teamwork. It exemplifies FPA’s fair and collaborative spirit: everyone helps each other to be better prepared, rather than leaving individuals to figure it out alone. Many members cite this program as one of the most valuable aspects of FPA membership, as it turns lessons into muscle memory.
