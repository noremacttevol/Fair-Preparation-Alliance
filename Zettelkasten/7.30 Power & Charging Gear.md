## 7.30 Power & Charging Gear

Keeping devices powered during an outage is crucial, so FPA members invest in backup power solutions:

- Portable Power Banks: High-capacity USB battery packs to recharge phones, radios, headlamps, etc. Many have multiple and cycle them to ensure readiness.  
      
    
- Solar Chargers: Foldable solar panels (10W-100W) that can charge power banks and 12V batteries. Solar setups may include a charge controller and deep cycle battery for a small off-grid system at home base. Even a small solar phone charger is carried by some in bug-out kits.  
      
    
- Generators: At community and some personal levels, gasoline, propane, or dual-fuel generators provide AC power for critical appliances. Chapters might maintain a generator for running a community center or charging multiple devices. Inverter-generators are preferred for electronics due to cleaner output. Fuel stabilizer is stored with gas for long-term readiness.  
      
    
- Manual Generators: Some have crank generators or pedal-power setups (e.g., a bicycle generator) to produce power without fuel. Hand-crank radios and flashlights double as small generators for themselves.  
      
    
- Battery Management: A stock of rechargeable batteries (AA, AAA, 18650, etc.) and adapters that allow use of various sizes (like AA-to-D cell spacers). Also DC-DC converters and car chargers to use a vehicle’s battery for charging devices. Members learn to safely jump-start a car and use an inverter from the cigarette lighter for small AC needs.  
      
    
- UPS and Surge Protectors: For home, an uninterruptible power supply on important electronics to ride out short outages and protect from surges when power returns.  
    By having layers of power options – from personal banks to community generators – FPA maintains communications, lights, and essential electronics. They know fuel can limit generator use, so they prioritize running only essential loads and using solar or manual means for the rest. This way, the alliance can stay charged and connected, mitigating one of the most disruptive aspects of disasters: the loss of electricity.
