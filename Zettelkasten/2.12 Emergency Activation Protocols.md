## 2.12 Emergency Activation Protocols

  

When a crisis strikes or appears imminent, FPA follows a set of predefined activation protocols to mobilize the network quickly and efficiently. Activation Triggers: The SOP defines what events trigger an official “activation.” Some triggers are obvious and external (e.g., a natural disaster warning like a Category 5 hurricane forecast, an earthquake occurring, the declaration of martial law, a widespread cyberattack causing grid failure). Others might be internal decisions (e.g., leadership assesses rising civil unrest and declares a Phase 2 activation proactively). In practice, chapters don’t wait for top-down orders if communications are down; they have criteria: “If X happens and you cannot reach anyone, assume activation and follow your training.” Alert System: Upon activation, an alert is sent out via all available channels. In Phase 1 times, this could be a group text with a specific codeword or phrase the members recognize as an emergency signal (something like “FLASH Protocol Red” or any agreed term). The [[Communication Strategy and Layers]] ensures redundancy – if cell networks are unreliable, the alert might go via radio broadcast at a scheduled time (FPA has pre-arranged times for emergency check-ins). Some members may have loud sirens or alarms (like a distinctive car horn pattern) to alert nearby members if needed. Immediate Actions: Each member has a checklist of immediate actions upon receiving an activation notice: secure their home and family, grab go-bags or pre-load vehicles if evacuation is likely, and establish contact on the primary FPA comm channel (typically the Realnet node or designated radio frequency). They’ll also switch to using their FPA call signs and codes to coordinate. If the emergency is localized, unaffected members might begin staging to assist (for instance, if one member’s neighborhood is on fire, others outside that area activate to help with evacuation). Rally and Accountability: One of the first steps is accounting for everyone. The group does a roll call via comms – anyone who doesn’t respond is noted, and if safe, someone physically checks on them. Rally points might be used: depending on scenario, either a primary rally location (if evacuation/bug-out scenario) or simply hunker down and communicate (if shelter-in-place scenario). FPA’s plan usually designates an initial meeting place if communications are out – e.g., “If no comms and it’s safe to travel, all who can will meet at Location X by 6 PM.” The activation protocols include time windows – “If you haven’t heard from leadership within Y hours of trigger, proceed with autonomous group rally.” Role Assignments: At activation, certain members assume predefined roles. For example, the Communications Lead will ensure the Realnet node is up or that radio relays are staffed (if using ham operators to bounce messages). The Medic member checks that medical kits are ready and may pre-position at the rally point. The Security/Scout members might go ahead to the rally or safehouse to secure it before others arrive. The Quartermaster would begin packing shared supplies into vehicles. These roles are pre-planned so that little discussion is needed in the moment. Information Gathering: Simultaneously, FPA activates its intelligence gathering. Members monitor emergency broadcasts, news, social media (if up), or use scanners. They feed updates into the group comms – “City is ordering evacuation of downtown”, “Power outage extends across three counties”, etc. This helps refine the response (maybe the group decides to relocate further if the situation looks worse than thought). Phased Activation: Sometimes activation is incremental. For a looming threat like a slow-coming hurricane, FPA might go into a “standby” activation first (alert everyone to be ready) and then a full activation closer to impact. For sudden events, it’s immediate. Integrating New Info: As the situation evolves, the protocols adapt. E.g., if initial plan was to rally at Safehouse A but intel says route to A is blocked, the Communications Lead will relay “Alternate rally at Site B” as per backup plan. Members confirm receipt with simple acknowledgements. Because this could get chaotic, protocols emphasize concise, clear communication and confirmation. Secure the Network: Activation also means going into a higher security posture. The OPSEC guidelines from [[Operational Security (OPSEC) Measures]] intensify – communication might move to encrypted channels exclusively, unnecessary radio chatter is cut to reduce intercept risk, and members might use their predetermined “handle” instead of real names even among themselves, in case outsiders are listening during the chaos. Coordination with Neighbors: The protocols may also include guidance on linking with friendly neighbors or community once core FPA coordination is done. For example, after the FPA group is set, they might offer help to immediate neighbors (which can also secure the neighborhood and thus FPA’s environment). But this is done carefully and after internal stability is ensured. Deactivation or Transition: The activation stays in effect as long as needed. If it turns out to be a false alarm or the situation resolves (e.g., hurricane veered away), leadership will send a stand-down message (e.g., “ALL CLEAR – Resume Phase 1 mode, stay prepared”). If the emergency persists or ushers in a longer collapse, then Phase 2 mode continues and becomes routine operations. Activation is essentially the bridge between normal and emergency operation, after which Phase 2 procedures (like sustained resource sharing, etc.) take full effect (see [[Phase 2: Network Expansion & Communications]]). Overall, these emergency activation protocols are practiced via drills (as in text tree tests or mock alerts from [[Drills and Simulations]]). This ensures that when a real activation happens, members don’t panic – they have a playbook to follow, and muscle memory from simulations. The clear chain-of-command and steps laid out by the protocols save precious time and can mean the difference between an organized evacuation versus a chaotic scramble. (Cross-ref: [[Decision-Making Process]] – in activation, decisions often shift to pre-planned protocols rather than deliberation. Also [[Emergency Frequencies and Channels]] specify which comms to use on activation.)
