## 1.13 External Partnerships and Outreach Policy

  

While FPA primarily focuses on its members, it does not exist in isolation and thus has a policy for external relationships. External partnerships refer to alliances or cooperative arrangements with other groups, organizations, or community entities that align with FPA’s mission. This could include local community emergency response teams (CERT), ham radio clubs, farming co-ops, or even other prepping networks. FPA’s approach is to cautiously engage with such partners for mutual benefit while protecting its own operational security. For example, a local FPA chapter might partner with a neighborhood watch or church group for disaster drills or share non-sensitive resources like public training sessions (e.g., offering a first-aid class to the broader community). The policy dictates that any formal partnership or sharing of FPA resources outside the group must be approved by leadership and openly communicated to members, so everyone understands what is being shared and why (transparency is key to maintain internal trust). Outreach is the proactive side of external relations – in Phase 1, FPA keeps a relatively low profile (to avoid drawing unwanted attention) but does subtly recruit and educate the community. Outreach activities might include hosting preparedness workshops for the public, running a booth at a community safety fair under a generic name, or through phase 3, broadcasting helpful information via [[Outernet (Phase 3 Media Layer)]] content that anyone can access. The policy here is not to explicitly advertise the full extent of FPA’s network to outsiders (to avoid infiltration or being targeted), but to present a positive, helpful face that can attract quality individuals who may become future members. For example, an FPA member might run a podcast on emergency preparedness (which is part of the Outernet plan) – it serves the public and also indirectly showcases the mindset of FPA, potentially drawing interest from like-minded listeners. When dealing with external offers of collaboration, FPA evaluates them based on alignment with values and security risk. Any outside entity with extremist views or that expects FPA to compromise its fairness or trust principles is politely declined. Conversely, if a local government emergency planner wanted to liaise, FPA might agree to share non-critical info (like community needs) but would keep member identities private ([[Member Privacy and Data Security]]). Essentially, FPA’s policy is to be a part of the solution in a crisis beyond just its members – ethically they want to help the larger community – but to do so in a way that does not expose or dilute the Alliance. As FPA moves into Phase 3, outreach becomes more open, with [[Outernet (Phase 3 Media Layer)]] and possibly public-facing initiatives to aid reconstruction ([[Rebuilding and Recovery Planning]]), but even then, the distinction between FPA’s internal network (the “Realnet/Real network”) and its public outreach is maintained. Members are coached on what they can share publicly and what stays internal ([[Public Outreach and OPSEC in Communication]]). This careful balancing act allows FPA to maintain good public relations and partnerships without losing its core identity or security.
