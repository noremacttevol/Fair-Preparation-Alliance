## 1.6 Decision-Making Process

  

FPA strives for a collaborative and transparent decision-making process at all levels. Major strategic decisions (such as adopting the Phase-based plan or instituting a new program like [[“Test My Plan” Program]]) are typically discussed by the National Council and then communicated to members for feedback before finalizing, reflecting a semi-democratic approach. While not every decision is put to a vote, member input is highly valued – often surveys or informal consultations on the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] forum are used to gauge member sentiment. In local chapters, decisions regarding group activities (like planning a drill or taking in new members) are generally made by consensus or majority vote during chapter meetings. The Alliance emphasizes reaching consensus where possible to maintain unity: leaders facilitate discussion and try to address concerns so that decisions have broad support. When quick action is required (e.g., during an unfolding emergency), designated leaders (national or local, depending on scope) have the authority to decide swiftly – for instance, a chapter lead can decide on an evacuation route, or the comms team can decide to activate backup [[Ham Radio Network]] protocols. However, even in these cases, communication is key: leaders explain their decisions to the group as soon as feasible to maintain trust. There are also checks and balances: if a decision is controversial, members can appeal it up the chain or ask for a review by the leadership council, ensuring accountability (related to [[Accountability and Transparency]]). At times, formal guidelines are documented: the [[Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)]] includes a section on decision hierarchy (e.g., life-or-death immediate decisions defer to whoever is on scene and qualified, whereas long-term policy changes require broad input). Importantly, FPA’s decision-making is guided by its values – any proposal is measured against the mission and core principles from [[Core Values and Principles]] to ensure alignment. This process has allowed FPA to be both participatory and decisive, avoiding paralysis by analysis but also avoiding authoritarian rule.
