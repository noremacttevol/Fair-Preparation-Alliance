## 3.13 Inclusivity & Diversity

“Fair Preparation” is not just a name – it’s a mandate that preparedness resources and knowledge be open to all, regardless of background or status. FPA actively works to include members of diverse ages, genders, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Outreach efforts aim to bring in those who might not traditionally see themselves as “preppers,” such as urban residents or people with limited income, by tailoring advice and training that fits different circumstances. The alliance also considers accessibility in its plans: for instance, including strategies for helping members with disabilities during evacuations, or translating key documents into multiple languages if needed. By valuing diversity, FPA not only grows its knowledge pool (different perspectives bring new ideas) but also ensures that in a crisis, no community is overlooked. Inclusivity strengthens the network because it builds trust across different groups and combats the stereotype of preparedness being exclusive – everyone has a seat at the table and a role to play.
