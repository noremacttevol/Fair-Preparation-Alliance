## 7.35 Signaling Devices

Effective signaling can attract rescuers or guide team members. FPA’s kits include various signaling devices:

- Whistles: As mentioned, a whistle is carried by everyone (3 blasts for emergency). Pea-less designs are preferred (no moving parts to freeze or jam) with high decibel output.  
      
    
- Mirrors: Signal mirrors (with aiming sight) are small but powerful daytime SOS tools, flashing sunlight up to miles away. They’re kept in survival kits, often with instructions printed on them for quick use.  
      
    
- Flares: Handheld flares or flare guns are in vehicle kits and boat kits for emergency signaling to distant observers or aircraft. They double as fire starters in dire situations. FPA trains on safe usage since they burn extremely hot.  
      
    
- Flagging & Panels: Bright orange signal panels or VS-17 marker panels are used to mark locations (like an X or signals on the ground for aerial search teams). Even brightly colored tarps or ponchos can serve this role if needed.  
      
    
- Chem Lights (IR and Visible): Chem lights again – visible spectrum for general signaling (swinging on a cord to create a large circle of light motion which is a known rescue signal), and some teams even have infrared chem lights or beacons to signal to those with night vision (for stealth or special coordination with authorities).  
      
    
- Smoke Signals: In wildfire-safe conditions, smoke generators (like smoke canisters) or simply setting green branches on fire to create white smoke are taught as daytime signals. Some caches have rescue smoke flares.  
      
    
- Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs): A few members invest in PLBs or satellite SOS devices which, when activated, send a distress message with GPS coords to emergency services (this is more individual rescue tech than group, but FPA acknowledges their life-saving potential).  
    Through these means, if any member or team needs to be found or needs to guide others in, they have the gear to do so. Drills include signaling practice—like setting up a signal panel message or using mirrors. The overarching principle: no matter how off-grid or lost someone might be, they have a way to call for help or direct assistance to their location using simple, robust signaling tools.
