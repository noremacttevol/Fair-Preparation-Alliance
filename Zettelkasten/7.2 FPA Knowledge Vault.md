## 7.2 FPA Knowledge Vault

The FPA Knowledge Vault is a centralized, curated repository of the Alliance’s accumulated wisdom, plans, and references – essentially the brain of the group. It’s organized as a digital library (often using systems like Obsidian or a private wiki) that contains everything from emergency plans and checklists to how-to guides and past incident debriefs. Each member has access to the vault (or at least the portions relevant to them), and key portions are also kept in printed form or on durable media in case digital access fails. The vault is structured in a Zettelkasten-like manner with notes that are densely interlinked (e.g., a note on “Generator Maintenance” will link to “Fuel Storage” and “Power Management” notes, etc.), enabling quick navigation of related topics. Categories cover areas like Communication (the very notes we’re compiling here), First Aid, Security, Logistics, etc., and within those, numbered notes (for example, this combined file eventually splits into such notes). There’s also a section for official documents: PDFs from FEMA, Red Cross manuals, local evacuation maps – so members can find authoritative info easily. What makes the vault especially useful is that it’s maintained – outdated info is flagged and updated, new insights from drills or actual emergencies are added (see [[3.19 Continuous Improvement]]). It’s a living collection. The vault also has an index or search function to find things rapidly by keyword. In practice, when a situation emerges, members consult the vault as needed: e.g., if a wildfire approaches, someone might quickly open the “Wildfire Action Plan” note to ensure all steps are being followed. By having this knowledge infrastructure, FPA lessens reliance on memory under stress and provides a common operating picture – everyone referencing the same plans and facts. It also greatly aids new members: instead of tribal knowledge scattered in veterans’ heads, much is documented for them to learn from. In summary, the FPA Knowledge Vault is the embodiment of “prepare the mind”: an accessible, well-organized trove of information that can guide the Alliance through known and novel challenges alike.
