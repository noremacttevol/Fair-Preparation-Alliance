## 1.7 Trust Doctrine and Trust Building

  

The Trust Doctrine is a foundational ethos of FPA that formalizes how trust is established, maintained, and protected among members. It acknowledges that in a survival alliance, trust is the currency that enables cooperation – without it, no plan can succeed. The Trust Doctrine sets expectations that members will prove their reliability over time through actions: keeping confidences, following through on commitments, and contributing to the group. New members undergo a trust-building phase (see [[Vetting and Screening Process]] and [[Onboarding New Members]]), often starting with small responsibilities and gradually earning greater trust as they demonstrate integrity. The doctrine also outlines that trust is mutual and layered: members should trust but verify – meaning healthy caution is maintained (for OPSEC reasons) until trust milestones are met. For example, a chapter might initially restrict sensitive information (like the locations of supply caches or personal details) until a member has been with the group for a certain period and participated in multiple [[Drills and Simulations]]. The Trust Doctrine encourages the use of a “buddy system” ([[Buddy Teams and Cell Structure]]) and mentorship ([[Mentorship and Peer Support]]) to integrate members socially, as personal bonds strengthen trust in the larger network. It also emphasizes honesty internally: members are expected to be truthful about their capabilities and intentions; any deceit is seen as a severe breach (leading to [[Disciplinary Actions and Removal]] if needed). Additionally, the doctrine defines protocols for conflict resolution – if trust is broken (e.g., a member violates an agreement or security), there is a process to address it (see [[Conflict Resolution and Discipline]]). By articulating these principles, the Trust Doctrine serves as both a philosophy and practical guide: it reassures members that they can rely on one another and provides a common understanding that trust is earned and cherished. Many FPA members consider the Trust Doctrine the “glue” of the Alliance – it turns a collection of preppers into a true community. (Cross-reference: [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] which codifies behaviors that build trust, and [[Assisting Non-Members in Crisis]] which addresses extending trust carefully to outsiders.)
