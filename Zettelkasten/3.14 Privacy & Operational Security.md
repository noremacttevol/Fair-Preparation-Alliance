## 3.14 Privacy & Operational Security

The Alliance maintains a careful balance between open collaboration and necessary secrecy. Members’ privacy is protected: contact information, home locations, and details about personal caches are guarded and only shared on a need-to-know basis or within trusted circles. Digital communication channels are often encrypted or secured (for example, using secure messaging apps or private forums) to prevent eavesdropping by malicious actors or simple privacy leaks. Members may use call signs or pseudonyms on public radio frequencies or external forums to avoid revealing identities. This operational security (OPSEC) mindset is important because during a crisis, hoarding or well-prepared groups can become targets. Thus, FPA teaches members how to discuss plans discreetly, protect sensitive documents (perhaps by storing them in encrypted files or within the protected [[7.2 FPA Knowledge Vault]]), and compartmentalize information – meaning not everyone needs to know every detail, only what is necessary for their role. These measures ensure the safety of members and the security of shared resources.
