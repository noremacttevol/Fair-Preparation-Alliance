## 7.33 Tools & Repair Kits

Having tools on hand allows FPA members to fix problems and build solutions on the fly:

- Multitool & Knife: In addition to EDC, larger fixed-blade knives or machetes for heavy-duty tasks (splitting wood, brush clearing) are kept in kits. A multitool with pliers and screwdrivers is invaluable for gear repair.  
      
    
- Hatchet or Saw: For processing firewood or cutting through debris, a small axe or folding saw is often carried or stored in group gear.  
      
    
- Shovel & Entrenching Tool: Compact e-tools in personal packs, and full-size shovels in vehicle or group caches (for digging fire pits, latrines, or vehicle extraction).  
      
    
- Rope & Cordage: Plenty of paracord (at least 50-100 feet per kit) and possibly heavier rope or towing straps. Also bungee cords and zip ties for quick binding solutions.  
      
    
- Duct Tape: Universally included for repairs – wrapped around water bottles or flat pieces to save space. Can mend a torn tarp, splint a limb (in a pinch), or seal a punctured shoe.  
      
    
- Repair Kits: Sewing kit with heavy-duty needles and thread (and patches for clothing or gear). Spare buckles, buttons, and safety pins. If carrying inflatables (mattress, raft), include patch kits. Epoxy or super glue for rigid fixes. Wire (like bailing wire) for binding or fixing fences.  
      
    
- Hardware: A small assortment of nails, screws, and wire nuts can enable building or repairing structures when combined with found wood or scrap.  
      
    
- Sharpening Tool: A knife sharpener or file to maintain blades and tools.  
      
    
- Crowbar/Pinch bar: A small crowbar helps with prying open crates, doors or removing nails safely.  
    These tools empower members to improvise and overcome challenges – from building a shelter from raw materials to fixing a leaking pipe at a retreat. The Alliance often runs workshops on basic handy skills using these tools so everyone knows, say, how to safely use an axe or properly sew a tear. By equipping themselves with even a modest toolset, FPA ensures that when something breaks, they can likely fix it, rig it, or craft a workaround, turning potential setbacks into minor hiccups.
