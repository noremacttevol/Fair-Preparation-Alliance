## 7.9 Map & Navigation Data

Navigation is critical in emergencies, so FPA ensures robust access to maps and navigation data. Each chapter compiles detailed maps of their area: road maps, topographic maps, evacuation route maps, and even historical maps (which sometimes show old wells or back roads that newer maps omit). These are kept both digitally (offline map files like MBTiles for use in apps) and in printed atlases. They also maintain GPS data: key location coordinates (like safe houses, caches, radio repeater locations, etc.) are listed in a reference document for use with GPS devices or to plot on maps. Some members are tasked with updating these maps as things change (new construction, closed roads, etc.). The Alliance uses map tools to mark things like resource locations (rivers, cisterns, edible plant zones), potential hazards (chemical factories, floodplains), and rally points. In the Knowledge Vault, a note might list “Local Map Resources” with links to the maps and instructions on how to use UTM grid or latitude/longitude to find positions. They also include compass navigation guides and practice orienteering – those skills are documented and refreshed so if satellites or electronics fail, members can navigate by compass and map. For broader awareness, FPA keeps atlases for state and national scale as well, foreseeing scenarios of long-range evacuation. In digital form, they often use apps like OsmAnd or Gaia GPS preloaded with the entire region’s data on their phones (with external battery packs at the ready). They also distribute navigation sets: for example, a USB drive with offline maps and a how-to for installing on phones/laptops, often given to new members. Recognizing that maps can be worth their weight in gold, FPA also protects them – waterproof cases for important charts, multiple copies (one in your go-bag, one at home, one in the cache). Periodic map reading exercises are held, and members are encouraged to familiarize themselves with alternate routes to common destinations. By diligently managing navigation data, FPA ensures that no one is ever truly “lost” – they have the tools and knowledge to find their way or find each other, no matter the conditions.
