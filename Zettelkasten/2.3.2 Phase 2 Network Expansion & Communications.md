## 2.3.2 Phase 2: Network Expansion & Communications

  

Phase 2 begins when significant crises occur – this could be a single catastrophic event or a gradual breakdown of normal infrastructure and order. In Phase 2, FPA shifts from quiet preparation to active network deployment and mutual aid. One of the first actions is to bring the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] fully online. During Phase 1, Realnet (a dedicated, secure communication network for FPA) was prepared; in Phase 2 it becomes the primary means for coordination. Members connect via Realnet nodes (which could be internet-independent mesh networks, pre-arranged radio data links, and local servers running off backup power) to maintain group communication even if the Internet and phone systems fail. At the same time, the [[Ham Radio Network]] becomes critical – members check in on designated emergency frequencies ([[Emergency Frequencies and Channels]]) at scheduled times to account for everyone and share situational updates (this provides redundancy if Realnet nodes are isolated). Network expansion in Phase 2 also implies connecting previously separate local chapters into a more tightly knit web: region-to-region communication is established through relays or courier if needed ([[Sneakernet (Physical Data Transfer)]] might be used to physically carry information if digital comms are fragmented). The alliance’s organization scales up – regional coordinators emerge to link local efforts, ensuring that, for example, a lightly affected area can send help to a devastated area. Another major aspect of Phase 2 is mutual aid and resource sharing. Based on the groundwork in Phase 1, members now execute plans to help each other: they pool resources at safehouses or predetermined caches, perform duties like security shifts, community watch, and medical support for the group. If one member’s area is hit by a disaster (e.g., their neighborhood floods or faces civil unrest), nearby FPA members coordinate through Realnet/ham to assist with evacuation or supplies, according to the [[Emergency Activation Protocols]]. The alliance essentially activates as an independent emergency support organization for its members and potentially trusted neighbors. Security and OPSEC remain high priority: as public systems falter, FPA instructs members to be vigilant. [[Physical Security Measures]] are implemented collectively (teams might guard a perimeter around a group shelter or escort convoys of family members moving to safer locations). All communication on networks uses code names or ciphers where possible ([[Communication Security (COMSEC)]] measures) to prevent eavesdroppers from identifying FPA locations or resources. Also, Phase 2 often sees growth by necessity – people in crisis seeking help. FPA has to decide how to handle non-member requests now under more dangerous conditions. Generally, they stick to aiding members first but may temporarily assist outsiders in dire need in a controlled way ([[Assisting Non-Members in Crisis]] guidelines apply) without revealing full involvement (for example, doing charity anonymously or under a “relief group” label). Phase 2 can be prolonged if society is in a slow collapse; FPA essentially becomes a parallel system keeping members alive and informed. Importantly, throughout Phase 2, the Alliance continuously updates situational awareness: members report local conditions (food shortages, violence, disease outbreaks) via the network, which leadership compiles to see the big picture – effectively building an intel mosaic better than official sources. This helps them make decisions like when/where to relocate assets or if certain areas remain safe. If pockets of stability remain (e.g., some grid power somewhere), they’ll leverage those to support others. Phase 2 is the crisis survival phase – FPA’s success here is measured by member safety and the network’s functionality. Once stability begins to return or if the crisis becomes protracted with FPA as a stable subsystem, the Alliance will prepare to transition to Phase 3. But Phase 2’s immediate objective is clear: preserve life, preserve communication, preserve the Alliance under adversity. All the training from Phase 1 is put into action now. (Detailed plans and protocols for Phase 2 tasks are found in notes like [[Emergency Activation Protocols]], [[Resource Management and Logistics]], and [[Coordination Structure and Chain of Command]] as they adapt to crisis conditions.)
