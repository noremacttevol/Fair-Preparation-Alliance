## 3.10 Local Chapters & Regional Groups

Because members are spread across different areas, FPA encourages the formation of local chapters. A local chapter is essentially a regional subset of members who can meet face-to-face, coordinate local resources, and respond to events in their vicinity. These chapters might align with a city, county, or multi-county region, depending on member density. Each chapter often elects or acknowledges a chapter lead or coordinator who liaises with the broader FPA network. Local chapters allow for tailored planning (addressing region-specific risks, like hurricanes on the coast or earthquakes in certain areas) and enable quicker physical mutual aid (neighbors helping neighbors). They also serve as the first rally point in crises â€“ members first check on and assist their local group, then extend help outward in coordination with other chapters.
