## 7.39 Cache & Stash Supplies

In addition to what members keep at home or carry, FPA often sets up caches: hidden or secured stashes of supplies along evacuation routes or at strategic locations. Gear related to caches includes:

- Buried Cache Containers: PVC pipes with sealed ends, or metal ammo cans and buckets with gasket lids – chosen for durability and waterproofing. These hold reserve supplies and are buried or concealed (marked subtly or recorded via GPS).  
      
    
- Storage Drums: Larger 55-gallon drums or totes at safe houses containing bulk supplies (food, water, fuel). Not exactly hidden, but pre-positioned at known rendezvous points (like a member’s farm outside the city).  
      
    
- Geocache-style Microkits: Tiny waterproof capsules or boxes containing emergency info, copies of documents, a flash drive of the vault, maybe some cash or a radio frequency list – tucked in safe deposit boxes or in-wall hides as backups.  
      
    
- Dummy Caches: Sometimes a decoy stash is set with some basic supplies to mislead potential raiders away from the main cache.  
      
    
- Locks and Camouflage: Caches might be secured with combination locks (whose code is known to members) or disguised to look mundane (a false rock, or a cache inside an old piece of machinery on a property).  
    Cache supplies typically mirror core needs: a cache might have a few days of food and water, batteries, a change of clothes, basic first aid, and copies of important info – enough to sustain someone who lost everything or to resupply a group on the move. FPA plans them such that if a group must flee with only what’s on their back, hitting a cache en route can dramatically improve their situation. They keep an inventory of caches in the knowledge vault (securely). Maintenance runs are scheduled to refresh water and rotate food. The gear strategy here is redundancy and insurance: if one cache is compromised, others still exist. Members are made aware of caches relevant to likely bug-out paths, and contingency plans exist if a cache retrieval fails. By caching supplies, FPA extends its logistical reach and resilience, making sure that even if primary stores are lost or inaccessible, not all is gone – proverbial “eggs” are in many baskets.
