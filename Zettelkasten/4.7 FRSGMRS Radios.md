## 4.7 FRS/GMRS Radios

For short-range, immediate team communications, FPA relies on Family Radio Service (FRS) and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radios. These are the common “walkie-talkies” that are inexpensive and easy to use. FRS requires no license, has built-in antennas and limited power, making it great for intra-neighborhood or campsite comms. GMRS allows higher power and use of repeaters but does require a license (however, one license covers a whole family and is easy to get). In FPA, each local chapter designates a primary FRS/GMRS channel for local chatter – for example, Channel 3 might be the default for your group (chosen to avoid interference if Channel 1 or 2 are crowded locally). Members keep these radios in their go-bags and practice using them during drills. During an operation (like a search for a lost person or coordinating a supply drop), FRS/GMRS are invaluable for real-time coordination because they don’t depend on anyone being a ham operator and can be used by any member. The Alliance may standardize a particular model of radio for compatibility and ease of training (for instance, recommending a certain brand that many use, so everyone knows its interface). FRS/GMRS fills the gap for quick, local team talk when cell phones might be too slow or down, and when ham radio might be overkill or not everyone is licensed.
