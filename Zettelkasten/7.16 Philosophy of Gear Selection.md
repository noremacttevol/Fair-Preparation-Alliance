## 7.16 Philosophy of Gear Selection

When it comes to gear, FPA follows a deliberate philosophy: prioritize reliability, versatility, and sustainability over flashiness. The Alliance teaches members that the “best” gear is that which you have tested yourself and can maintain. Brand names or expensive models aren’t automatically endorsed; instead, gear is often evaluated by how well it meets needs in different phases (will it work with and without power, can it be repaired in the field, etc.). A key concept is dual-use or multi-use items – gear that serves multiple functions gets high marks (for instance, a sturdy tarp can be shelter, water collector, camouflage, stretcher, etc.). FPA also stresses interoperability: whenever possible, choose gear that works with standard batteries (AA/AAA over exotic ones), common fuel types (propane or gasoline that others stock), or standard calibers if discussing tools for defense. Weight and size are considered, especially for go-bag items – something might be great at home but too heavy to carry in evacuation, so they’ll seek lighter alternatives or duplicates (one for home cache, one for mobile kit). The Alliance also preaches “two is one, one is none” – meaning have backups for critical gear, but mindful that redundancy doesn’t mean unnecessary duplication of rarely used items. Simplicity is valued: a manual can opener may be preferred over an electric one, fewer moving parts equals less chance to break. They also incorporate gear sustainability: items that are rechargeable via solar, or that can use renewable resources (like a wood gas stove vs. canned fuel only) are favored to last through a long crisis. Cost is a factor in fairness – they often seek the best-value option, not always the absolute best performing if it’s prohibitively expensive for many. Essentially, gear selection in FPA is about balance – every item should earn its place by contributing significantly to survival, comfort, or efficiency, and those chosen are robust enough to trust under duress. Members share reviews and experiences, which the Alliance consolidates into recommendations (like the [[7.41 FPA Approved Gear List]]). The philosophy ensures that group resources aren’t wasted on gimmicks, and that when an emergency comes, everyone’s equipment is up to the task because it was chosen with care and foresight.
