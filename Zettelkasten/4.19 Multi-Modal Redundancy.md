## 4.19 Multi-Modal Redundancy

A core concept in FPA’s communication design is redundancy across multiple modes. In practice, this means that for any critical message, there are several possible paths to get it through. For instance, consider a situation update that needs to reach all members: it might be sent via a group text message, simultaneously posted on the online forum, and also announced over the radio net. Members are instructed to check at least two channels if possible, to ensure they don’t miss anything. Multi-modal redundancy also covers hardware: important communications gear like radios have backup power (battery packs, solar chargers) and backup units available. The Alliance encourages having both a primary and secondary means of communication on hand – e.g., a mobile phone (primary in normal times) and an FRS radio (secondary), or a ham radio (primary in blackout) and a satellite messenger (secondary for critical SOS). Even within radio, there’s redundancy: if the repeater is down, use simplex; if VHF is not reaching, try HF, etc. All critical information (like evacuation orders or change of rally point) is ideally confirmed via more than one method. This approach ensures that the failure of any single communication mode doesn’t paralyze the group. It’s why drills might involve purposely disabling one channel to practice using others. In summary, FPA’s communications are like a net with many threads – some threads can break, but the message still gets through on others. This layered redundancy is essential to resilience, guaranteeing that “two is one, and one is none” is more than just a saying – it’s standard operating procedure.
