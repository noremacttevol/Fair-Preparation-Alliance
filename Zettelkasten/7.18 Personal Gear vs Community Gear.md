## 7.18 Personal Gear vs Community Gear

FPA distinguishes between personal gear (items each individual or family keeps for their own use) and community or shared gear (larger or less-common items pooled for group benefit). Personal gear includes the basics everyone should have: their own go-bag with clothes, personal meds, a flashlight, knife, etc., and home supplies like food, water, a first aid kit. The Alliance provides guidelines for these so every member can be self-sufficient at least 72 hours or more. On the other hand, community gear might be things that not everyone needs to buy duplicates of, due to expense or bulk: examples are heavy tools (chainsaw, large tent, water purification station), advanced medical equipment (like a field trauma kit or defibrillator), communication infrastructure (long-range radios, repeaters), cooking equipment for many people (big pots, grills), or transportation assets (an inflatable boat, an off-road handcart). These are often stored centrally or with designated caretakers. The concept is efficient resource use – one well-maintained chainsaw accessible to the group is better than ten cheap ones gathering dust. FPA organizes how community gear is stored and accessed: for instance, a chapter might keep a trailer stocked with community equipment that can be hitched and brought to a disaster site where members gather. They also make plans for sharing personal gear when needed; e.g., if someone has a skill (like a ham operator) but another member has the actual high-frequency radio, they team up. Trust and clear agreements underpin this sharing: equipment lent out is expected to be returned in good shape or replaced if damaged. The Alliance sometimes invests collective funds (from donations or member dues) to purchase these community assets, viewing it as strengthening the group as a whole. Training includes making sure multiple people know how to use and maintain each community item (no use having a water purifier if only one guy knows how to assemble it and he’s not there). In emergencies, leadership coordinates the deployment: “Bring community generator to shelter location,” etc. By balancing personal gear responsibility with strategic communal assets, FPA achieves redundancy without unnecessary duplication, and ensures that big-ticket or specialized resources are available when and where they’re needed, benefitting all members.
