## 5.12 AI-Assisted Knowledge Management

FPA’s extensive knowledge base ([[7.2 FPA Knowledge Vault]]) can be enhanced by AI to ensure information is easily accessible and well-organized. One approach is using an AI to tag and interlink notes automatically: as members upload documents or write new notes, an AI might scan the text and suggest tags (“communications”, “first aid”, “logistics”) and even detect relationships (“This note on water filtration is related to another note on water storage”) thus recommending a link or reference. This complements the [[7.3 Zettelkasten and Linking]] method by catching connections humans might miss. AI-driven search is another big boon: instead of relying on exact keywords, members could ask in natural language, “find the protocol when someone’s radio goes missing” and the system would understand and pull up the relevant note on equipment loss procedures. The AI can also help summarize lengthy documents in the vault – giving a quick brief of a 50-page FEMA guideline, for instance, so members can decide if they need to read further. During an incident, if someone is frantically looking up “how to treat hypothermia” in the vault, an AI could prioritize and highlight the key steps or even present a checklist derived from multiple sources (handy if time is short). In essence, the AI becomes a librarian or research assistant that’s on call 24/7 within the alliance’s knowledge management system. It can even watch usage patterns: if a certain info is frequently sought, it might suggest creating a dedicated quick-guide for it. On the flip side, if some stored info is outdated or contradictory across sources, an AI might flag this inconsistency to the knowledge managers. By deploying AI within their information ecosystem, FPA ensures that the massive trove of data they collect doesn’t become unwieldy; instead it remains nimble and user-friendly, with AI doing the heavy lifting of organization and retrieval so members can get answers with minimal friction.
