## 2.7 Physical Security Measures

  

Beyond information security, FPA also prepares physical security plans to protect members and resources. Preppers understand that in a severe crisis, threats from looters or desperate mobs are possible, so the Alliance incorporates collective defense strategies (always ethically and legally grounded). Home and Retreat Security: In Phase 1, members harden their homes or agreed safe locations: reinforcing doors, having contingency lighting (like motion sensor lights or solar lights) to deter intruders, and perhaps creating layered defenses (thorny bushes under windows, etc.). The [[Approved Gear List Overview]] includes security items like quality locks, alarms (including low-tech tripwire noise makers), and personal defense tools. Members often help each other with security audits of homes. Mutual Defense Pacts: FPA chapters develop a plan that if one member’s location comes under threat, nearby members will come to assist if feasible. For example, a neighborhood watch-style rotation might be instituted in Phase 2 where members take turns patrolling the area at night in teams. They might use whistles or radios to call for backup from each other if something is amiss. Safe Zones and Perimeters: If the chapter consolidates to a group shelter or base (say several families move into one farm or building for better defense), they establish a perimeter. This could involve setting up obstacles (vehicles, barricades) at key entry points, laying out fields of view for surveillance, and designating guard posts. The SOP might assign two-person guard shifts to ensure at least one awake guard at all times when threat level is high. [[Coordination Structure and Chain of Command]] and specialized roles come into play here – e.g., a member with military or security background might be in charge of organizing defense. Rules of Engagement: FPA’s ethical stance informs their defensive rules – they do not seek conflict and will avoid violence if possible. Members are trained to de-escalate; for instance, if strangers approach, the initial response might be to warn them off from a distance or negotiate (maybe offering a small aid rather than risk an attack). However, if an attack is imminent, members are prepared to defend themselves with proportionate force. [[Self-Defense and Firearms Training]] ensures those who carry weapons are proficient and understand local laws (in Phase 1, everything is legal ownership; in Phase 2, they adapt as needed). Non-Lethal Defenses: FPA also considers non-lethal deterrents – floodlights, loud alarms, pepper spray, tear gas if available, etc., to ward off intruders without immediate resort to lethal force. They stock items like heavy-duty pepper gel, stun devices, or even paintball guns with pepper balls for area denial at closer ranges. Convoy and Travel Security: When members must move (bug out convoys, supply runs), they plan routes with security in mind. Typically, at least two vehicles travel together; members are armed (if legal/necessary) and maintain communication between vehicles. They have plans for ambushes – e.g., not entering choke points blindly, having scouts or using ham radio to get intel on road conditions. If a convoy is large, they’ll put a capable driver at front and back (in case of blockade, the lead can push through or the rear can cover retreat). Camouflage and Stealth: Sometimes the best defense is not being noticed. FPA trains in basic fieldcraft: using natural cover for camps, noise and light discipline at night, and not wearing anything that screams “I have supplies.” Vehicles might be mud-smeared or look less appealing intentionally. Community Integration: Another aspect of physical security is working with non-member neighbors when possible. If the whole neighborhood bands together, it’s safer for all. FPA members often try to quietly encourage neighbors to form a watch or share simple signals (“we’ll hang a red cloth if we see suspicious people”). This not only spreads the work of security but also helps avoid an “us versus them” scenario locally. However, sensitive info (like exactly what FPA stores) is still kept within the group. Emergency Retreat: The physical security plan includes what to do if a location is overrun or untenable: a fallback location is designated (with a route and rally time), and a signal for abandon site (like three long whistle blasts) is defined. Members practice evacuating under duress with go-bags so if worst comes to worst, they can escape and regroup alive. All these measures are tailored to threat levels. In peaceful times, they’re subtle (just locks and a watchful eye). As danger grows, they escalate in a coordinated way. By having thought through and practiced these physical security measures, FPA reduces panic and confusion if confronted by violent threats. Each member knows their role (e.g., who watches which sector, who handles communications, who leads non-combatants to safety), making the group much more resilient against external aggression than individuals on their own. (Reference: the idea of “collective defense” mentioned parallels content in external prepper community discussions. See also [[Mutual Aid Among Members]] since security is a form of mutual aid, and [[Self-Defense and Firearms Training]] for training aspects.)
