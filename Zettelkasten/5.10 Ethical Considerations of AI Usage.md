## 5.10 Ethical Considerations of AI Usage

While AI offers many benefits, FPA remains conscious of the ethical implications and potential pitfalls of using these technologies. Privacy is a significant concern: members’ personal data (like inventory of their supplies or health info for the AI coach, or having cameras around) must be protected. The Alliance establishes clear rules on what data is collected, who can access it, and ensures anything sensitive is encrypted or anonymized. Consent is obtained – for instance, a member can opt out of any monitoring device in their home or personal life. There’s also the reliability concern: AI can make mistakes or biased suggestions. FPA teaches members to trust but verify AI outputs. If an AI tool flags a low-risk in something that common sense says is high-risk, human judgment prevails. They do not allow AI to be a sole decision-maker for critical choices that might risk lives; it’s an aid, not a commander. Transparency is promoted: whenever possible, the reasoning of an AI (the data and assumptions) is shared so members can understand why a recommendation is made (this isn’t always possible with black-box models, but FPA leans toward more explainable tools). Additionally, the Alliance remains mindful of dependency – they prepare to do without AI, because in Phase 3 scenarios the fancy cloud-based systems might be offline. Therefore, all AI-enhanced processes have a manual fallback. The ethical stance is also about fairness: ensure that AI doesn’t inadvertently marginalize any member (for example, if an AI tool only caters to tech-savvy users, FPA will compensate with training or alternate methods for those less comfortable). By grappling with these issues openly, documenting policies in the knowledge base, and periodically reviewing their tech through an ethics lens, FPA strives to use AI responsibly and equitably, preserving the trust and cohesion of the group above all.
