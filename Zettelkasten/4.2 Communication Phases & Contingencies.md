## 4.2 Communication Phases & Contingencies

Communication plans are phase-dependent, adapting to the level of infrastructure available. In normal conditions (Phase 1), members rely on everyday methods like phone calls, text messages, emails, and online platforms. As a situation escalates to Phase 2 (partial outages or high congestion), contingencies kick in: for example, everyone might switch to SMS texts or a specific radio channel if phones become unreliable, since short text messages often go through when calls do not. By Phase 3 (major infrastructure failure), the plan assumes internet and phone networks are down – communications shift entirely to offline methods such as ham radio nets, local walkie-talkies, and physical runners. These contingencies are decided in advance and practiced ([[4.17 Regular Nets and Drills]]), so no one is scrambling to figure out how to connect. A cascade system is often in place as well: if a member cannot reach the group, they attempt to reach an out-of-area contact or chapter liaison who can relay messages (a principle borrowed from family emergency plans). This phased approach means no matter the scenario, there’s a predetermined way to communicate, minimizing chaos at each stage.
