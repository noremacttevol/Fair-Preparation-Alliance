## 4.26 Distress Signaling

If an FPA member is in trouble and needs to signal for help, there are established distress signaling methods known to all members. For electronic comms, certain code words or phrases serve as a distress call over the radio or text that might not be obvious to outsiders (to avoid drawing unwanted attention). For instance, a member might say on the radio “I need a coffee break” as a covert way to signal duress or immediate danger, prompting others to respond with aid or a check-in on that member’s welfare. On open channels, they can use the standard “Mayday” or “SOS” calls if appropriate; members with ham radios know how to make an emergency call on repeater networks or even to aviation/Marine bands if absolutely needed. Visually, a member can use the international SOS pattern (··· --- ···) with a flashlight or whistle as mentioned in [[4.23 Signaling (Non-Electronic)]]. FPA also shares with members general knowledge like creating a large ground symbol (e.g., big “X” or writing “SOS” with rocks) if lost or stranded for any aerial searchers. Each member’s personal emergency plan (as part of training) includes a way to attract help: signal mirrors in their kit, flares or smoke canisters if legal and safe to use, etc. Importantly, the Alliance emphasizes that a distress signal should be unambiguous – they standardize on signals so that if any member sees, hears, or receives one, they immediately act and not assume it might be accidental. Drills occasionally practice this: e.g., a member pretends to be injured and signals, and others must correctly identify it and respond. By having clear distress protocols, FPA ensures that if any one of them is in life-threatening need, they have multiple ways to cry for help and a high chance that someone in the network will notice and mobilize assistance.
