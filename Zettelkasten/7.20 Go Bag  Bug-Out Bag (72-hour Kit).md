## 7.20 Go Bag / Bug-Out Bag (72-hour Kit)

Perhaps the most emblematic prep, the Bug-Out Bag (BOB) – or simply Go Bag – is a backpack pre-packed with everything one needs to survive for about 3 days when evacuating. FPA guides all members in assembling and regularly updating their BOBs. A typical FPA-recommended BOB contains:

- Water: around 2-3 liters per person, plus a filter or purification tablets for obtaining more (water is heavy, so they balance carrying some vs ability to get more).  
      
    
- Food: non-perishable, ready-to-eat items for 72 hours (energy bars, trail mix, dried meals) focusing on high calorie and ease of preparation (minimal cooking, just add water, etc.).  
      
    
- Clothing: a change of clothes suitable for weather (thermal underwear, socks, durable pants, weatherproof jacket, hat, gloves) – layering is emphasized. Also a mylar blanket or compact sleeping bag for warmth.  
      
    
- Shelter: a lightweight tent or tarp with cordage, or at least a bivvy sack. Something to keep off rain and wind.  
      
    
- Fire-making: lighters, waterproof matches, ferro rod – ideally two methods.  
      
    
- First Aid Kit: a more robust kit than EDC, including trauma items (tourniquet, gauze, antiseptic, any personal prescriptions for a week).  
      
    
- Tools: knife (if not already in EDC), multi-tool, maybe a small folding saw or wire for snares, duct tape (often wrapped on a small flat piece), and a few yards of paracord.  
      
    
- Lighting: headlamp (with spare batteries) plus a small backup flashlight or chem light sticks.  
      
    
- Communication: ideally a battery-powered radio (tuned to emergency stations or a group channel) and maybe a two-way radio to contact others, along with extra batteries. Also a printed contact list of family/FPA members, since phones may die.  
      
    
- Navigation: physical maps of likely evacuation areas, a compass, and the skill to use them (possibly also a GPS device if they have one, but not solely reliant on it).  
      
    
- Hygiene: basic sanitation items (toilet paper, hand sanitizer, a small trowel for digging cat holes, menstrual supplies if needed, soap or wipes, toothbrush).  
      
    
- Personal Protection: could include pepper spray, a defensive tool if one is trained (varies by member comfort and laws), and N95 mask and goggles if relevant (for smoke/debris).  
      
    
- Important Docs: copies (or originals if needed on the move) of ID, insurance, emergency plans, stored in a waterproof ziplock, plus some cash.  
    FPA encourages customizing BOBs for individual needs (kids, pets, medical conditions) but these core categories must be covered. Regular drills include grabbing the Go Bag and simulating a quick departure to see if anything is missing or too heavy. Weight management is crucial – they aim for a balance between packing comprehensive supplies and keeping the bag manageable for potentially long treks on foot. Many chapters have “BOB inspection” days where members open and review each other’s kits to suggest improvements and catch expired items. With a well-prepared bug-out bag, an FPA member can evacuate on short notice and still be self-sufficient and effective (perhaps even help others) for at least 72 hours, which is often the critical window before outside help or further group support is mustered. The BOB is therefore a cornerstone of individual preparedness within the alliance’s overall strategy.
