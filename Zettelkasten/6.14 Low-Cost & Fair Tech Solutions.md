## 6.14 Low-Cost & Fair Tech Solutions

Staying true to its name, FPA prioritizes fairness in innovation, meaning new solutions must be attainable by all members, not just those with deep pockets. One focus is on low-cost alternatives: for instance, instead of a pricey commercial satellite phone, they might promote a $20 DIY antenna and an SDR (software defined radio) dongle to receive weather satellite images or Outernet broadcasts. They heavily use open-source software (free) over proprietary. If a member codes a useful app or macro, it’s shared freely. They also negotiate group buys or build kits to distribute cost: an innovation here is the “prepper co-op purchase” model – members chip in to buy materials in bulk (like a pallet of solar panels or tons of bulk food) at wholesale, then split them, which is an economic innovation making expensive items affordable. The Alliance also adapts everyday items to emergency use, which can be seen as innovation: e.g., using cheap pool shock (calcium hypochlorite) to make gallons of bleach for water purification, instead of buying expensive purifier tablets – a known trick but one they package into a clear how-to for all. Fair tech also means considering people with different abilities: FPA designs innovations so they don’t exclude those who are less tech-savvy. For example, a mesh radio might be complicated to operate for some, so they create a one-button interface or preconfigure it so the user just turns it on and it works. They also test ideas in different environments – apartment dwellers vs rural homes – and iterate so that solutions scale and adapt. In summary, FPA’s innovation is not just about the cutting edge; it’s about the appropriate edge – the point where value and cost balance so that every member, regardless of income or skill, can participate in and benefit from the new tool or method. This conscious approach ensures that each advancement the alliance makes raises everyone up together.
