## 7.34 Fire-making & Fuel Gear

Fire serves multiple needs (warmth, cooking, signaling), so FPA members carry redundant fire-making tools and manage fuel wisely:

- Lighters: Simple but effective – multiple Bic-type lighters stored in waterproof pouches in every kit. Also a refillable butane lighter for windproof flame if possible.  
      
    
- Matches: Waterproof matches or storm matches that burn long even in wind, plus a striking surface protected from moisture. Some even dip matches in wax for extra waterproofing (with striker kept dry).  
      
    
- Ferrocerium Rod: A metal striking rod that produces sparks when scraped – lasts for thousands of strikes and works when wet. Accompanied by a steel scraper or they use knife spine. This is a reliable backup not reliant on fuel.  
      
    
- Tinder: Prepared tinder materials like cotton balls soaked in petroleum jelly (packed in film canisters), commercial tinder tabs, fatwood sticks, or dryer lint in wax. Helps start a fire quickly when kindling is damp or scarce.  
      
    
- Magnifying Lens: In sunny climes, a Fresnel lens card or magnifying glass can start a fire with focused sunlight – a no-fuel, no-moveable-part method.  
      
    
- Fuel Storage: For those with stoves or lanterns, small fuel canisters are part of gear. FPA advises storing fuel (propane, white gas, etc.) safely and tracking usage to have enough for expected outage durations.  
      
    
- Fire Safety Gear: A collapsible shovel (to manage campfire and cover with dirt) and a bucket or container for water/sand are often on hand to fully extinguish fires. Also, knowledge of clearing a fire ring and wind management is imparted.  
    Members practice fire-making under various conditions (after rain, at night quickly, with one hand simulated injury, etc.). Having multiple ignition sources ensures they can always create flame – critical for survival. In essence, FPA treats fire-making as a fundamental skill and equips each person to confidently and safely spark a life-sustaining fire whenever needed.
