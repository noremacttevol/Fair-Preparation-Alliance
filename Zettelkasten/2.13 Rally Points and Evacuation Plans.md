## 2.13 Rally Points and Evacuation Plans

  

FPA establishes rally points as predetermined meeting locations where members can gather in an emergency, especially if communication is down or if evacuation is necessary. Each chapter usually has multiple rally points: a primary and one or two alternates (in case the primary is compromised by the situation). Selection of Rally Points: These locations are chosen carefully during Phase 1. They need to be known to all members, relatively easy to reach from members’ homes, and safe (or at least safer than staying put) for the scenario envisioned. Often rally points might be a member’s home that is in a defensible or less affected location, a public landmark (like a park, trailhead, or church parking lot) known to all, or a spot outside immediate danger zones (e.g., outside a floodplain or city center). For widespread disasters, a rally might be outside the city entirely—like a rest stop along a highway. The alternate rally points are typically in opposite directions; if the disaster blocks one route, members can go to the other. Each rally point is coded in communications (for OPSEC, they might say “Rally Alpha” meaning one spot, “Rally Bravo” meaning alternate). Evacuation Routes: FPA works out at least two evacuation routes for each member or sub-group to reach rally points – a primary route (fastest) and a backup route (maybe longer or through back roads but likely passable if main roads are jammed or dangerous). During planning, members share local knowledge of shortcuts, choke points, and hazards along these routes. They also consider modes: if car travel is not possible (roads blocked or fuel shortages), what is the walking or biking route? Members are encouraged to do a trial run of these routes in normal times to familiarize themselves. Procedure on Evacuation: When an evacuation order or decision is made (either by authorities or by FPA internal call), members execute their personal home evacuation plan (grabbing go-bags, securing home, etc.) and head to the rally point via the planned routes. The [[Emergency Activation Protocols]] would often trigger this. The first member(s) to arrive at a rally assume temporary responsibility to note who’s coming in and to secure the area. If it’s an outdoor spot, they might scout for any threats or clear a space for parking/tents. Accountability at Rally: As members arrive, they check in with whoever is tracking (perhaps a designated rally leader). If someone doesn’t show up within expected time, that info is logged and after a grace period, the group may send a team back or on their route to search (resources permitting). They also might leave a message or sign at the rally point for latecomers – e.g., chalk mark or note saying where the group went next if they had to move. On-Site Actions: Depending on the scenario, once at the rally point, the group might not stay long (it might just be a link-up location before traveling onward out of danger), or it might become a temporary camp/base. For example, in a fast wildfire evacuation, rally point is just to ensure everyone made it out, then the plan may be to continue together to a more distant safe zone. In a slower crisis like societal unrest, the rally point (if at a member’s secure home) could become the operating base. FPA’s plan covers both: a quick regroup then onward travel, or setting up a semi-permanent camp. Supplies at Rally: Ideally, rally points (at least primary) have some pre-staged supplies. If it’s a member’s home or property, that member likely stored group supplies (water, fuel, extra food, and tools) anticipating its use as a safehouse. If it’s a public spot, perhaps a cache could be buried nearby (though on public land that can be tricky). At minimum, the first arrivals bring what they can to support the group until everyone consolidates resources. Alternate Communication if Stragglers: If someone is delayed or circumstances force a change, FPA has protocols like leaving behind a “relay” person or a note. For instance, if they must depart the rally due to danger, they leave a written message in a secure but findable spot (like under a specific rock or taped inside a public sign) telling latecomers the new plan. All members know to check that spot if they arrive to an empty rally. This is part of the [[Sneakernet (Physical Data Transfer)]] style contingency. Urban vs Rural Differences: In urban areas, rally points might be just outside city limits or at a known community building. In rural chapters, rally might simply be the largest member’s farm or home. They consider the scenario – for local house fire, rally is hyper local (neighbor’s yard). For regional disaster, rally is well outside the affected radius. Integration with Family/Work: Members also plan how to retrieve family or meet them. Some families might rally internally first (e.g., spouse picks up kids from school, then family heads to group rally together). If at work, members plan which rally to aim for (maybe a member at work across town goes to an alternate if it’s closer, and others know to meet him there later). These details are hashed out in [[Onboarding New Members]] when personal plans are shared, so the group is aware. Drills and Maps: FPA chapters often distribute maps with routes and rally points marked (securely, to avoid leak). They also practice getting to them (as in [[Drills and Simulations]] bug-out drills). By doing so, they iron out issues (maybe a gate is usually locked at the park at night – plan who has bolt cutters or alternate entry). Post-Rally Next Steps: Once assembled, the chapter can then implement broader plans: maybe travel together to a regional safe zone or coordinate with other chapters. The rally point is a crucial intermediate step that ensures no one is left behind and that resources and information are consolidated. It's a physical manifestation of the Alliance – coming together when it counts.
