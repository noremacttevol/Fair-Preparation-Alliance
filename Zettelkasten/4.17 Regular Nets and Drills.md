## 4.17 Regular Nets and Drills

Practice makes perfect, particularly with emergency comms, so FPA conducts regular communication nets and drills. A “net” is a scheduled on-air meetup via radio where members check in and exchange brief updates. For example, the local chapter might hold a weekly ham radio net every Monday at 19:00 on a set frequency. During these nets, a net control (one member) will call for check-ins, log who’s on air, and perhaps run a quick exercise (like asking a question everyone answers in turn, just to practice passing traffic). Similarly, some chapters do a monthly emergency drill where they simulate a comms outage: for one evening, everyone pretends phones are down and uses only radio or alternate means to coordinate a simple task (like “all confirm your status via radio by 8 PM”). The Alliance may also have surprise drills – sending out an unexpected “This is a drill” alert on a random evening to see how quickly people respond and what methods they use. These exercises highlight weaknesses (e.g., someone’s radio was off or a member was out of range) so they can be addressed. Over time, regular nets build proficiency – members become comfortable with equipment and protocols under low-stress conditions. Then in a real crisis, using these comms is second nature. Drills also reinforce the phased plan: e.g., the group might simulate Phase 2 by having the net start with phone texts and then “lose cell service” and shift to radio mid-way. In summary, routine practice ensures that the Alliance’s communication plans aren’t just written down, but ingrained in behavior.
