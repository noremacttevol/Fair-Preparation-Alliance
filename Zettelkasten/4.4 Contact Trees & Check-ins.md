## 4.4 Contact Trees & Check-ins

To organize communication, FPA uses contact trees and scheduled check-ins that ensure everyone can be reached or accounted for. A contact tree is essentially a cascading phone/communication tree: for instance, each member is assigned one or two people to call or message after they themselves receive an alert. This spreads the word quickly and avoids single points of failure. The contact list includes not just members but also key emergency contacts (like a designated out-of-town person for each member, in case local lines are down). Members are encouraged to have an ICE (“In Case of Emergency”) contact stored in their phones and to share that info within the group. Regular check-in times are established during crises (e.g., every 12 hours, at 9 AM and 9 PM) where all who can will report status via the best available channel. Even during normal times, FPA might do a weekly roll-call via an online group or radio net just to practice this accountability. The result is a reliable system where no one gets forgotten: if a member doesn’t check-in as expected, others know to follow up or, in a disaster, possibly physically go check on them if safe. This structured approach provides peace of mind that every individual is monitored and can receive help or information when needed.
