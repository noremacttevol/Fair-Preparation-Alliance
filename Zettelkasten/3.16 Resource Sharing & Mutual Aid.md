## 3.16 Resource Sharing & Mutual Aid

FPA membership means that resources are not hoarded individually when they can save lives collectively. The Alliance encourages members to pool certain supplies for the group’s benefit and to lend a hand to fellow members in need. This could mean establishing a community cache of supplies (food, water, fuel, medical gear) that is accessible during crises, or simply an informal agreement that “if my generator runs and yours doesn’t, you can charge your radio at my place.” Mutual aid extends beyond tangible goods: members offer shelter to each other (for example, if one member’s home is in a flood zone, another member in a safe zone might host their family during an evacuation). Pre-arranged support networks ensure that during a disaster, no member is left stranded. The principle is reciprocal: today one member might give, tomorrow they might receive. By sharing resources fairly and according to need, the Alliance amplifies each individual’s preparedness into a robust collective safety net.
