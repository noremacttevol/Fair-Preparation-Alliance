## 4.12 Mesh Networking (Off-Grid Data)

Beyond traditional radios, FPA explores modern mesh networking technology to enable off-grid data communication. Mesh networks allow devices (like smartphones or dedicated mesh modules) to connect directly to each other without central infrastructure, passing messages node-to-node. For example, the Alliance might employ devices like goTenna Mesh or use apps like Briar or Serval on phones, which create a local mesh via Bluetooth/WiFi. Another advanced example is using LoRa (Long Range) modules with open-source firmwares (e.g., Meshtastic) that let members send short text messages over several miles by relaying through intermediate nodes. FPA sets up and tests these mesh networks during drills: a few stationary nodes might be placed in high locations to act as relays, effectively creating a community intranet in a grid-down scenario. Mesh has the advantage of being decentralized and scalable – if more members join with devices, the network range and reliability improves. It’s ideal for sending text updates, GPS locations, or even files (slowly) within the group when no internet exists. Part of the knowledge base might include instructions on how to configure and use mesh devices and what channels/settings to use so that all devices are compatible. By investing time in mesh networking, FPA is creating a digital lifeline that doesn’t depend on telecom companies – a way to keep smartphones useful (as messaging tools) even when cellular networks are dead, effectively extending communication capabilities of the group quietly in the background of their overall emergency plan.
