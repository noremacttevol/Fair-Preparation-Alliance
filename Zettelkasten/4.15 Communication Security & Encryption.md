## 4.15 Communication Security & Encryption

Security in communication is paramount to FPA, not just for privacy but for safety. Members are trained to use encryption tools and best practices whenever appropriate. In digital channels (Phase 1 scenarios), this means using secure messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption, utilizing encrypted email (PGP) for sensitive information, and perhaps operating through a VPN when online to mask activities. For radio communications, while one cannot truly encrypt amateur radio legally, the Alliance uses tactical brevity codes or plain language “in code” (prearranged phrases that sound normal but carry specific meaning known internally) to obscure sensitive information. For instance, rather than saying “The supply cache is at John’s house,” members might say a coded phrase or reference a nickname that outsiders won’t easily identify. They avoid using full names or exact locations over open air. Additionally, the Alliance takes care with record-keeping – important logs or contact lists are encrypted at rest (maybe a shared password-protected document accessible to core members). When using devices like laptops or phones for comms, members enable device encryption and strong authentication to prevent data falling into the wrong hands if lost. During active operations, sensitive chats or emails might be routinely purged or secured. The underlying approach is to assume that adversaries or opportunists could be listening or looking; thus FPA communications aim to deny useful intelligence to non-members while still conveying what the group needs among itself. This balance of openness (within the group) and secrecy (to outsiders) is maintained through disciplined use of encryption and coded language across all phases of comms.
