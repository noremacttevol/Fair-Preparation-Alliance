## 7.4 Digital Platforms (Tools for Knowledge Sharing)

To facilitate knowledge management and communication, FPA uses a suite of digital platforms (especially in Phase 1 when internet is available). They leverage tools like secure cloud storage (for example Nextcloud or Google Drive) to back up important documents, and services like Slack/Discord or Matrix for daily discussions and file sharing. Obsidian, as mentioned, might be the primary platform for the knowledge vault, allowing syncing across members’ devices so everyone has the latest notes. They also experiment with self-hosted solutions: perhaps running a local wiki or DokuWiki on a Raspberry Pi that can be accessed on the mesh network ([[6.7 LoRa and Mesh Networking]]), giving an intranet feel. During normal times, an online forum or Q&A board is maintained where members ask questions and experts answer – this content later gets distilled into formal notes if it’s valuable. Recognizing that not everyone is online 24/7, FPA also sends out a monthly newsletter (email and print) summarizing new learnings, upcoming training, or gear review highlights, ensuring even less active members stay in the loop knowledge-wise. The alliance is careful to secure these digital channels (using encryption, strong authentication) since they often discuss sensitive prep details. They encourage members to download or print critical items regularly in case the cloud becomes unreachable. Another platform in use is a task or project management tool (like Trello or an open-source equivalent) where collaborative projects (e.g., setting up a community garden, or writing a new handbook section) are organized, and knowledge from those projects eventually migrates to the vault. By effectively using digital platforms, FPA creates a daily knowledge-sharing culture – not just storing info, but actively discussing and updating it. This means that the knowledge base isn’t static; it’s continuously refined in chat rooms, video meetings, and collaborative docs, then captured in an organized way for posterity. Through technology, they ensure everyone can contribute to and benefit from the group’s collective intelligence, no matter where they are.
