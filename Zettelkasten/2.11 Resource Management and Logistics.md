## 2.11 Resource Management and Logistics

  

FPA approaches resource management with the mindset that the network is its own supply chain in crises. While each member maintains personal stockpiles, the Alliance coordinates to optimize resources and fill gaps. Inventory and Skills Mapping: Early on, chapters do a capabilities inventory – not just who has what supplies (though broadly, yes, like number of generators, water filters, medical kits in the group) but also who has what skills or assets that can produce resources (like gardening, hunting, mechanical repair skills, or ownership of a truck that can haul heavy loads). This inventory is kept somewhat private (OPSEC considered) but is used for planning. Avoiding Duplication and Covering Gaps: If the inventory shows everyone bought water filters but no one has a grain mill, the group can suggest someone acquire a hand-crank grain mill or other missing tools. Or if five people have excess of one type of item and another has none, they might arrange swaps internally. FPA often coordinates group buys for essential gear to save cost and ensure each member has the basics from the gear list. Shared Resources: Some expensive or bulky items are collectively shared rather than each member individually buying. For example, a chapter might pool funds to buy a high-quality medical kit or bulk medical supplies that are stored centrally with the chapter’s designated medic. Or invest in a community-owned emergency generator or water purification unit that could serve multiple families at a base location. These resources are managed by the group with clear rules on access. Caches and Staging: FPA establishes strategic caches of supplies. These can be hidden stores along evacuation routes (a sealed barrel with water, fuel, first aid, etc., buried or hidden) or at safehouses (a member’s farm outside the city might stock extra food and tools for the group). Logistics planning determines what to put in caches: items to resupply members if they have to flee with only a go-bag, or to sustain the group if bringing all their own stores wasn’t possible. [[Sneakernet (Physical Data Transfer)]] concept also extends to moving physical supplies if needed – e.g., having pre-packed bins that can be quickly loaded into a car or even hauled by a handcart in worst case. Maintenance and Rotation: A key part of resource management is keeping supplies viable. The group might have a rotating schedule to check caches – making sure stored food isn’t expired, fuel is rotated or treated, batteries are charged or replaced. They maintain a logistics calendar (maybe via Realnet or a shared document) that alerts when certain stored items need refreshing (e.g., rotate water storage every 6 months). If the group has a garden or livestock in a friendly member’s care, others pitch in labor in exchange for share of produce, thereby integrating ongoing resource generation. Logistics in Crisis (Phase 2): When an emergency hits, FPA has a logistics plan ready. For example, they know which vehicles are available and who will drive them (if evacuating, one member with a truck might do multiple trips to help move others’ families or gear, following the plan). They set rally points that allow for load consolidation – at a rally, members pool what they brought to ensure an even distribution. Perhaps family A’s house burned so they lost supplies; the group will allocate extra from others so that family still has food and water. Supplies are then managed collectively to some degree – the group might designate a “quartermaster” role to track group inventory and ration if needed. Resupply and Scavenging: FPA also plans for acquiring resources post-event. Members skilled in hunting, fishing, foraging or gardening will take lead on those tasks, while others maybe secure fuel from safe, non-intrusive sources (like siphoning from abandoned equipment, but always ethically – e.g., not stealing from fellow survivors). If doing any scavenging, they do it systematically and carefully (buddy teams go out with communication, areas are assigned to avoid duplication, and OPSEC is maintained to not advertise what they gathered). The logistics team prioritizes needed items – e.g., water and medical supplies first, then fuel, etc. Fair Distribution: True to “fair preparation,” the Alliance has an understanding that resources will be shared so everyone meets basic needs. It’s not absolute communism – personal property is respected – but in dire straits, the ethic is that no one in our group starves or freezes while another has plenty. If someone contributed less before, they aren’t left to die, though afterwards things might be evened out in work or replacement. This fairness is discussed beforehand to prevent conflict during crises. Record-Keeping: Even in a crisis, basic record-keeping helps: the quartermaster might keep a notebook of stores used and remaining (e.g., “Canned food: 120 cans at start, using 12 per day for group of X, will last 10 days.”). This aids decision-making (like planning a resupply mission before it’s completely gone). They also track member status (who might need extra due to health issues, etc.). In Phase 3, formal logistics might ease as supply chains slowly recover, but Phase 2’s robust resource management can make the difference between life and death. Transportation Logistics: If the network spans a region, they plan routes for moving goods between chapters. Perhaps one rural chapter has surplus harvest, and an urban chapter has extra medical supplies – in a stable moment, they might coordinate a swap via an agreed meeting spot. The Alliance leverages Realnet to coordinate these moves under the radar. In summary, FPA treats the combined assets of members as a coordinated arsenal against disaster. Through planning and cooperation, they amplify what individuals have, minimize waste and shortfalls, and ensure resilience through sharing. Many members find comfort knowing that even if they personally lack something, the Alliance likely has it covered and vice versa – which is the essence of a fair alliance. (Cross-ref: [[Sharing of Resources]] is echoed in the ethos of mutual aid, and [[Barter and Trade Strategies]] becomes relevant in Phase 3 when dealing with outside networks.)
