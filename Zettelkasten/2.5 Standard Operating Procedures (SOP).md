## 2.5 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

  

FPA’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) is a comprehensive set of guidelines and protocols that dictate how the Alliance operates on a day-to-day basis and in emergencies. Initially compiled in the FPA_SOP_Mk1Mod3 document, the SOP covers everything from communication etiquette to chain-of-command in various scenarios. Every member is expected to be familiar with the SOP, as it provides the playbook for coordinated action and reduces confusion when quick decisions are needed. Some key elements of the SOP include:

  

Communication Protocols: Detailing how and when to use different channels. For example, in normal times (Phase 1), important alerts might go out via a secure messaging app or email tree at specified check-in times. In crises (Phase 2), it dictates using the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] as primary and ham radio as secondary, with specific call signs and brevity codes (as elaborated in [[Communication Protocols and Etiquette]]).

  

Alert Levels and Activation: The SOP defines levels of alert (for instance, Green – normal, Yellow – watchful due to potential threat, Red – active emergency). At each level it outlines member actions. If a region goes Red, the SOP might instruct members to immediately attempt contact via designated channels, secure their families, and prepare to implement [[Emergency Activation Protocols]]. There are clear triggers for moving to these levels, decided by leadership or automated criteria (like a natural disaster warning).

  

Meeting and Reporting Schedules: In routine times, SOP might require local chapters to meet at least once a month (physically or virtually) and report a summary to regional coordinators. It may also set a schedule for national leadership calls or Realnet forum updates (ensuring information flows regularly).

  

Operational Security Measures: Rules around sharing information: e.g., never post identifiable personal prep details on public forums, use encryption for sensitive communications, maintain cover stories if needed (members might refer to FPA just as a “camping club” or similar publicly). This ties into [[Operational Security (OPSEC) Measures]] and [[Member Privacy and Data Security]].

  

Resource Storage and Cache Protocols: The SOP advises on how to store supplies safely (with rotation schedules for perishable goods), possibly the creation of group caches. It might outline that certain items (like extra fuel, medical kits) are kept in secure caches accessible to the chapter in case someone’s home cache is compromised. Access to caches might be controlled by multiple members (to enforce trust through mutual oversight).

  

Travel and Relocation Plans: Guidance for what members should do if they need to evacuate or travel to support others. For instance, a procedure if communications are down: after a set time with no contact, nearby members physically check on each other. Or if a member is traveling during a crisis, the SOP might have them attempt to link up with the nearest FPA chapter (with a directory of chapters included).

  

Safety and Conduct During Operations: Reinforcing that even under stress, members follow laws (as possible) and ethical conduct. For example, if encountering other survivor groups, the SOP might advise a protocol of cautious approach offering help, but not revealing everything (keeping group safety first). If violence is encountered, it stresses defensive action only ([[Self-Defense and Firearms Training]] guidelines integrated). Also, medical SOPs: e.g., basic triage procedures if multiple members are injured, and who leads medical decisions ([[Emergency Medical Preparedness]] covers some).

  

After-Action and Documentation: The SOP requires that after any major event or drill, the chapter lead compiles an After-Action Report (AAR) noting what happened, how the group responded, and lessons learned ([[Continuous Improvement and AARs]]). These AARs are then shared (sanitized of personal details) upward so the Alliance as a whole can update practices. This practice feeds into the iterative improvement of FPA’s framework ([[Plan Updates and Versioning]]).

The SOP is essentially the manual that turns FPA’s plans into actionable steps. It is kept up-to-date (currently Mk1Mod3 revision) by the leadership with member input. New members are trained on the SOP as part of [[Onboarding New Members]]. Many chapters conduct “SOP drills” – e.g., testing that every member knows how to respond to a mock alert per the SOP instructions. Because situations can evolve in unpredictable ways, the SOP also contains a principle: “When in doubt, fall back on FPA core values and best judgment.” Members are trusted to improvise if needed, but within the guardrails the SOP sets. Through adherence to the SOP, FPA ensures consistency and coordination – it’s what allows a dispersed network to function like a single organism under stress. (Cross-ref: The SOP heavily ties into notes across all categories, notably communication, security, and activation protocols, as it encapsulates many of those details in one reference.)
