## 2.15 Assisting Non-Members in Crisis

  

While FPA’s first responsibility is to its members, the Alliance also considers how to ethically and safely assist non-members (neighbors, community members, or strangers) during a crisis. The guiding principle is compassion balanced with caution. FPA recognizes that helping others in need is morally right and can build goodwill, but it must be done in a way that doesn’t jeopardize the group’s safety or deplete critical resources. Triage of Help: In a large-scale disaster, FPA can’t help everyone. The alliance informally triages situations: highest priority is aiding members and their immediate families; second priority might be trusted friends or adjacent households that members know well (sometimes called “outer circle allies” – folks who aren’t in FPA but have been friendly or preparing alongside informally). Third priority could be general public in acute distress (like pulling someone out of rubble, giving a bottle of water to a thirsty neighbor). OpSec While Helping: When providing aid to non-members, FPA is careful not to reveal the full extent of their capabilities. For example, if a neighborhood is without food, FPA might organize a quiet distribution of some excess food to a few families but they wouldn’t open their entire cache or advertise that they have large stores – they might present it as “we had a little extra to share” as opposed to showing up with a truckload that could attract a mob. Similarly, medical help might be given without revealing the source of medical supplies (“I had an extra bandage” rather than exposing a whole medic kit). Community Initiatives: In some cases, FPA chooses to create or support broader community relief efforts under a different banner. For instance, members may volunteer at a public shelter or soup kitchen that’s set up, blending in as concerned citizens rather than an organized prepper group. This both helps more people and conceals FPA’s internal organization (they’re just part of the community). In Phase 3, with Outernet and rebuilding, FPA might engage more openly in community projects, but in the heat of Phase 2, discretion remains. Assisting Allies: If prior to the crisis FPA identified certain neighbors as friendly (maybe even encouraged them with small preparedness steps), those folks might be semi-included in help. For example, if a non-member neighbor’s home burns down and they have nowhere to go, an FPA member may bring them along to the rally point and shelter them with the group at least temporarily, especially if they’re trustworthy. Such decisions often are left to local chapter consensus – can we accommodate this person/family safely? If yes, humanity dictates they are helped. FPA’s Trust Doctrine suggests being cautious, so if including a non-member in group shelter, they might set ground rules (like not revealing other members’ identities to them or limiting what sensitive discussions happen around them). Over time, that person might even become a member post-crisis if they prove reliable. Security Concerns: Unfortunately, crises can bring out desperate or predatory behavior. FPA evaluates situations: they’ll help genuine victims when feasible, but they remain wary of setups or lures. For example, if a stranger approaches## 2.15 Assisting Non-Members in Crisis

While FPA’s first responsibility is to its members, the Alliance also considers how to ethically and safely assist non-members (neighbors, community members, or strangers) during a crisis. The guiding principle is compassion balanced with caution. FPA recognizes that helping others in need is morally right and can build goodwill, but it must be done in a way that doesn’t jeopardize the group’s safety or deplete critical resources.

  

Triage of Help: In a large-scale disaster, FPA can’t help everyone. The alliance informally triages situations: highest priority is aiding members and their immediate families; second priority might be trusted friends or nearby neighbors that members know well (often these folks have been indirectly involved or prepared, sometimes called “friends of FPA”). Third priority could be the general public in acute distress (e.g., pulling an injured stranger out of rubble or providing first aid to someone in the street). The idea is to do the greatest good FPA can without overextending.

  

OPSEC While Helping: When providing aid to non-members, FPA is careful not to reveal the full extent of their capabilities or supplies. For example, if an FPA member gives food or water to a neighbor, they might frame it as a small personal reserve (“I have a little extra”) rather than indicating the group has a large cache. Medical help might be given using a basic kit in view, keeping the bulk of supplies hidden. If multiple members assist publicly, they won’t advertise they belong to an organized network – they just appear as good Samaritans from the neighborhood. This prevents FPA from becoming an obvious target for desperate mobs or authorities looking to requisition supplies.

  

Helping Neighbors: Often members will aid their immediate neighbors, especially if they have established rapport pre-crisis. For instance, if a neighbor’s house is damaged or they lack water, an FPA family might invite them over for shelter or quietly share some water. This not only is morally right but also improves neighborhood security (a neighbor who is aided is less likely to become desperate and turn on those around them). Chapters discuss beforehand: who among their neighbors or extended family could be brought under FPA’s wing in an emergency? Those people might be given limited support. However, if a neighbor group is very large, FPA might encourage them to set up their own arrangements rather than taking full responsibility.

  

Strangers at Rally Points: There’s always a possibility a stranger could wander into an FPA rally or safe zone asking for help. FPA instructs members to handle such situations cautiously but humanely. If the stranger is non-threatening and truly in need (say, an injured person or a lost child), members will provide basic assistance (medical aid, a bit of food or water, directions). But they will likely not bring a stranger into the center of their group’s hideout unless absolutely necessary. One technique is establishing a buffer zone: meet the stranger a little away from the main camp to gauge them and help without revealing the camp’s size or assets. If the person is traveling on, FPA might give them a small aid package and send them on their way with advice. If the person poses potential risk or is prying (asking about stockpiles, group size, etc.), FPA members politely but firmly limit interaction and may relocate shortly after to avoid giving away their position.

  

Community Relief Efforts: If broader community relief efforts are organized (by local churches, CERT teams, Red Cross, etc.), FPA members may choose to participate as individuals. For example, they might volunteer at a public soup kitchen or distribution center, contributing labor or know-how (without necessarily divulging their group ties). This way, FPA indirectly helps more people and can also stay informed about the crisis response, all while blending in. They’ll be cautious not to drain their own critical reserves through these efforts, contributing only what they can spare.

  

Security Concerns: In chaotic crises, offering help can sometimes attract unwanted attention. FPA is wary of traps (a plea for help that lures people into an ambush) or of being overwhelmed by a mob if word spreads that they have supplies. Therefore, any aid given is usually low-key and not publicized. Members communicate if they notice large groups of refugees or looters in an area, and FPA may temporarily suspend aiding outsiders if it endangers the group. They will never compromise a critical group mission (like evacuating a member or protecting a cache) by stopping for unrelated outsiders, unless lives are immediately at stake and intervention is feasible.

  

Inclusion of Extended Family/Friends: Many FPA members have loved ones who aren’t formally in the Alliance. Part of mutual aid (see [[Mutual Aid Among Members]]) extends to these folks. So when assisting non-members, priority often goes to these extended relations. For instance, if a member’s cousin shows up needing shelter, the group will typically accommodate them if possible because of the personal connection (and that cousin effectively becomes a provisional member under the wing of their relative). The group might brief them on rules (like OPSEC and contributing to chores). This is distinct from total strangers because there’s a trust bridge via the member.

  

Post-Crisis Outreach: As the situation stabilizes (Phase 3), FPA may shift to a more open helping posture. This is where the Alliance can shine publicly via the [[Outernet (Phase 3 Media Layer)]] or organizing rebuilding help (like helping neighbors rebuild homes, or sharing seeds to restart gardens). By then, with immediate survival secured, FPA can afford to be more generous and visible, possibly recruiting some of those they helped into the network for the future. But during the heat of the crisis (Phase 2), measured assistance is the norm.

  

In sum, FPA does strive to be a force for good in its community, not just a secretive clique. Members are reminded that maintaining humanity is part of what they’re fighting for. However, they also acknowledge that if they give away everything or expose themselves recklessly, they can’t help anyone in the long run. Thus, they walk a careful line: help where you can, but secure your oxygen mask first. This approach often earns FPA quiet respect from those who receive their aid, even if they never learn the full story of the Alliance. (Cross-ref: [[Public Image and Perception Management]] – responsible aid can improve public perception of preppers in general, and [[Legal and Ethical Compliance]] – FPA ensures any aid given doesn’t break laws or moral codes, e.g., they won’t resort to violence to aid outsiders unless absolutely necessary for defense.)
