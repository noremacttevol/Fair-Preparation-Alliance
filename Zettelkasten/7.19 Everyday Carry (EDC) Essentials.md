## 7.19 Everyday Carry (EDC) Essentials

Everyday Carry refers to the items one keeps on their person daily to handle emergencies or unexpected situations. FPA encourages members to maintain a thoughtful EDC kit so that they are never caught completely unprepared. While EDC varies by individual and context (urban vs rural, office job vs field job), there are common essentials the Alliance highlights:

- Multi-tool or knife: for cutting, prying, minor repairs (a good Leatherman or Swiss Army knife is popular).  
      
    
- Flashlight: a small LED flashlight or headlamp, with spare batteries, to deal with darkness or signal.  
      
    
- Fire source: such as a lighter or ferro rod, in case one needs to start a fire for warmth or signaling.  
      
    
- Emergency whistle: for audible signaling if in distress (small and easy to carry).  
      
    
- Mini first-aid: a few bandages, antiseptic wipes, any personal medication (like an EpiPen or inhaler if needed).  
      
    
- Water and/or filter: at least a half-liter water bottle and possibly a collapsible filter straw or purification tablets.  
      
    
- Phone and backup: obviously most carry a phone; FPA suggests a backup power bank or charging cable as part of EDC.  
      
    
- Cash and IDs: some cash in small bills and a government ID, plus any relevant medical cards (in a waterproof sleeve).  
      
    
- Notepad and pen: to leave notes, take info, or communicate if verbal isn’t possible.  
      
    
- Key tools: e.g., a small pry bar, or a pair of gloves, depending on one’s daily environment.  
      
    
- Protective mask: a foldable N95 or similar, in case of smoke, dust, or biohazards unexpectedly.  
    FPA’s stance is not to overburden; EDC must be light and feasible to truly carry every day (often it fits in pockets or a small pouch). Members share their EDC setups in meetings, showing clever ways to pack items or multi-purpose uses (a bandana is a common multi-use EDC item: can filter water debris, be a bandage, sun protection, etc.). Importantly, EDC is seen as the first line of preparedness – these items mean a member can survive or assist others for the initial hours of a crisis until they reach more supplies or fellow members. Even when nothing’s wrong, EDC items get used regularly (which is good, as it familiarizes members with them). The Alliance periodically updates an “EDC essentials” checklist reflecting best practices and new small gadgets (like tiny USB rechargeable lights, etc.). By standardizing a bit and promoting EDC, FPA helps each member maintain a constant state of readiness, turning everyday objects into a safety net that’s always within arm’s reach.
