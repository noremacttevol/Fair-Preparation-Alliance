## 2.19 Alliances and External Coordination

  

FPA is not an island; it recognizes the value of coordinating with other groups and organizations when interests align. Alliances in this context refer to established relationships or understandings with external entities – which could be other prepper networks, community organizations, or even local authorities – for mutual benefit in crises. Neighboring Prepper Groups: If there are other preparedness groups or MAGs (Mutual Assistance Groups) in the region, FPA may cultivate discreet alliances with them well before any crisis. This might involve a meetup between group leaders to discuss general plans or simply an introduction via ham radio. They might agree on things like an emergency frequency to contact each other, or an accord that if one group is overwhelmed, the other will try to help (resources permitting). These relationships are sensitive – OPSEC is maintained – but having a line of communication can prevent conflicts (like competing for the same resource unknowingly) and foster aid. For example, two groups might plan to divide responsibilities: one group sets up a community kitchen in a disaster, another provides security for that area. Community Organizations: FPA may quietly coordinate with local community emergency response teams (CERT), volunteer fire departments, or ham radio clubs. Often FPA members themselves are part of these organizations. Through those connections, FPA stays informed about official community response efforts and can integrate accordingly. If the Red Cross opens a shelter nearby, FPA might decide to support it by volunteering or alternatively decide to avoid it if they foresee issues, but that decision is informed by knowing about it through alliance contacts. Local Authorities: Direct coordination with government or law enforcement is approached carefully to avoid scrutiny pre-disaster. However, some FPA members might have roles as first responders or officials (or personal friends who are). During a crisis, those connections can prove invaluable: say a police officer friend can advise which areas are most dangerous, or a city emergency manager could loop in trusted community groups in relief planning. FPA might act on those tips. Conversely, FPA might anonymously tip off authorities about critical info (like discovering a fire outbreak beyond their control) to get help where needed. Shared Resources and Facilities: Alliances can allow sharing of resources. For instance, an allied ham radio club might let FPA use a powerful radio repeater during an emergency to extend communication range. Or an allied church might allow use of its hall as a safe meeting point (perhaps without publicly knowing the full extent of FPA, just that “neighbors need a space”). Pre-negotiating such arrangements (informally) is part of alliance building. Information Exchange: Allies will share intel. If another prepper group has weather instruments and notices something, they’ll tell FPA and vice versa. If CERT has done a neighborhood damage assessment, FPA tries to obtain that info instead of scouting the same area redundantly. This cross-feed of information via allied channels enriches situational awareness for all parties. Maintaining Autonomy: While coordinating, FPA remains independent. They typically avoid formal hierarchy under external command. The alliance is cooperation-based, not subordination. For example, FPA might agree to coordinate traffic control with another group, but FPA’s leader still directs FPA members. This ensures FPA can pull back if something goes against their principles or if their members are needed elsewhere. Conflict Avoidance: In chaotic events, different groups might mistrust each other or conflict over resources. By having pre-existing alliances or at least communication, FPA can negotiate rather than conflict. For example, if two groups arrive at a warehouse for salvage, if their leaders know each other, they might calmly split the contents rather than have a standoff. The alliance network thus acts as a deconfliction mechanism. Scaling Up Response: If an emergency is larger than FPA alone can handle (say a whole town is devastated), an alliance of multiple groups pooling efforts can create an effective ad-hoc civilian response force. One group’s medics, another’s cooks, another’s drivers, coordinated loosely through leader meetings, can cover more ground. FPA is open to such joint operations when lives are at stake. They may even establish a joint operations center (even if it’s a shared radio channel or daily meetup of group reps) to synchronize efforts for the broader community. Post-Crisis Community Building: In Phase 3, these alliances may formalize into coalitions aimed at rebuilding. FPA might take a leadership or advisory role in a “community preparedness task force” composed of various local groups that emerged. This sets the stage for a more resilient community thereafter. Limitations and Cautions: FPA will avoid alliances that threaten their core values or security. For instance, they’d be wary of aligning with any extremist militia or political group whose aims differ (to avoid guilt by association or internal division). They’ll also be cautious about alliances with heavy government oversight – they wouldn’t, for example, register their members on a government list in exchange for some help; the alliance stops short of exposing themselves completely. Essentially, FPA engages in alliances that enhance survival and community welfare, but always with an eye to safeguarding the alliance’s own integrity and continuity. By coordinating externally where prudent, FPA multiplies its effectiveness and helps ensure that the wider environment in which they operate is as favorable as possible. This is the outward-looking aspect of their strategy – not just surviving in a bubble, but contributing to and shaping the survival ecosystem around them.
