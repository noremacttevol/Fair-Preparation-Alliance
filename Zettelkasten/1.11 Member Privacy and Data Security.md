## 1.11 Member Privacy and Data Security

  

Protecting member privacy is crucial in FPA, both for personal security and to maintain trust in the Alliance. Many preppers value anonymity; FPA respects this by allowing members to disclose personal information gradually as trust grows. Upon joining, a new member might share only minimal personal details (first name or alias, general location, skills). The [[Vetting and Screening Process]] collects necessary info (like background and emergency contacts) in a confidential manner. FPA’s data handling practices ensure that any sensitive information (real names, addresses, inventories of supplies, etc.) is secured and accessible only to authorized leaders who need it (for example, a chapter lead might keep a list of member phone numbers in an encrypted file). Digital platforms used by FPA (like the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] and any online groups in Phase 1) are configured with security in mind: communications are encrypted where possible, and membership directories or maps are kept in private repositories, not public view. The Alliance trains members in privacy best practices, such as using pseudonyms or callsigns on radio (see [[Communication Protocols and Etiquette]]), practicing good cyber hygiene (strong passwords, not oversharing on social media about FPA involvement), and being mindful of surveillance. On the data security front, FPA’s knowledge base ([[“Whole Book” Master Documentation]] and [[Member Skills Directory]]) is stored in secure formats with backups (as noted in [[Data Security and Backups]]). Access to these is tiered: e.g., the full member list with addresses might only be held by regional coordinators, whereas general prepping guides are shared freely among all members. Privacy rules are also part of the [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] – members should not gossip about others’ preparations or identities outside the trusted circle. In the event a member leaves the Alliance or is removed, protocols ensure their data is removed from active lists to protect them and the group. The goal is that members feel safe providing information needed for group function because they know FPA will guard it diligently. Even within the group, an ethic of “need-to-know” is practiced for OPSEC: for example, a member’s exact home stockpile might only be known to their [[Buddy Teams and Cell Structure]] partners or chapter lead, not broadcast widely. Ultimately, this careful approach to privacy enables effective collaboration (since members do eventually share vital info like skills and emergency plans) without exposing individuals to undue risk.
