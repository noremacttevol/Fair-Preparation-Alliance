## 7.23 Home Shelter-in-Place Supplies

Not every emergency requires evacuation; in many cases, staying put (sheltering-in-place) is safer. FPA advises households on building robust home emergency supplies to sustain themselves during lockdowns, quarantines, or infrastructure outages. Key categories of shelter-in-place preps include:

- Water Storage: Aim for at least 1 gallon per person per day for a minimum of 2 weeks. This might mean storing several 5-gallon jugs, using water barrels (55-gal drums) treated with preservative, or even a bathtub water bladder that can be filled quickly when a crisis looms. Alongside stored water, have purification methods (filters, bleach, boiling capacity) to treat additional water if needed.  
      
    
- Food Supplies: Stock a pantry with non-perishables to cover the family for multiple weeks or months. FPA recommends foods you actually eat (rotated into normal use) plus some long-term staples like rice, beans, oats, canned goods, dried fruits, nuts, and possibly freeze-dried meals or MREs. Consider nutrition balance and morale boosters (spices, coffee, candy) since eating from storage shouldn’t be misery. Don’t forget baby food or pet food if applicable.  
      
    
- Cooking & Heating: If power and gas go out, how to cook? Solutions include a camp stove with plenty of fuel (used outdoors or with ventilation), a rocket stove, or a barbecue grill (and charcoal/propane). For indoor heating in winter, if you have a fireplace or wood stove, stock wood; otherwise, safe indoor heaters (like certain propane heaters rated for indoor use with ventilation) can be life savers. Even terracotta pot candles can provide a bit of warmth. Store fuel safely and have a carbon monoxide detector as a precaution.  
      
    
- Lighting & Power: Keep multiple flashlights and lanterns with extra batteries, and perhaps solar garden lights that charge outside by day and can be brought in at night. Candles and oil lamps are backups (with care for fire safety). For power, a home battery bank or generator can keep critical devices running – ensure fuel for the generator or a way to recharge batteries (solar panels on hand, hand-crank chargers). A small inverter can turn car battery power into AC for small appliances in a pinch.  
      
    
- Sanitation: If water service is disrupted, have buckets, plastic liners, and a makeshift toilet solution (like a Luggable Loo seat for a 5-gallon bucket) plus lots of garbage bags. Store extra hygiene items: soap, hand sanitizer, bleach, trash bags, toilet paper, feminine hygiene, diapers if needed, and lime or bleach to treat human waste if sewage lines back up. Cleaning supplies to maintain a livable environment.  
      
    
- Medical: A well-rounded home first aid kit augmented with any prescription meds (with as much extra supply as you can rotate), OTC meds for common ailments, and perhaps a stock of antibiotics and reference on their use (if one chooses, some preppers get animal antibiotics as a backup). Don’t forget vitamins or specific dietary needs for long term health.  
      
    
- Communication & Information: A NOAA weather radio or hand-crank radio to get news. Whistles or signal panel to call for help if needed. If internet works, the knowledge vault is there; if not, physical books on first aid, repair, etc., are ready.  
      
    
- Security: Means to protect the home if law enforcement is stretched thin – this could be as simple as reinforcing doors/windows, having loud alarm whistles or air horn, pepper spray, or legally owned firearms if the household is trained and comfortable (FPA treats self-defense carefully, ensuring responsibility).  
      
    
- Comfort & Morale: Lastly, things that make staying home bearable: playing cards, board games, books, perhaps a musical instrument, art supplies, etc., especially where kids are involved## 7.24 Water Procurement & Purification Gear  
    Ensuring clean water is paramount, so FPA members stock a variety of water-related gear:  
      
    
- Containers: Durable jugs, collapsible water bags, and canteens for carrying and storing water (including a means to collect rainwater).  
      
    
- Filtration: Portable water filters (like Sawyer or Katadyn) that can remove bacteria/protozoa. Many carry a straw filter for personal use and a gravity-fed or pump filter for group use.  
      
    
- Purification: Chemical treatments (water purification tablets or plain bleach with dosing knowledge) as backup to kill pathogens. Some also use UV purifiers (battery or hand-crank powered) for quick treatment.  
      
    
- Boiling setup: A metal pot or kettle (even a single-wall steel bottle) is kept handy for boiling water over a fire or stove – the surest purification method when fuel is available.  
      
    
- Well and hand pump: At fixed locations, if there’s a well, a manual hand pump or bailer bucket is maintained to retrieve groundwater without electricity.  
    This combination ensures members can procure (collect) water and make it safe in any scenario, whether filtering a creek on the move or treating tap water during a boil notice.
