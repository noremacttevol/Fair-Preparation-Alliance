## 7.38 Multi-use Items (Versatile Gear)

FPA loves gear that can serve many purposes, reducing pack weight and increasing capability. Some favorite multi-use items:

- Bandana or Shemagh: Functions as sun protection, dust mask, bandage, tourniquet, pre-filter for water, signaling flag, improvised bag or cordage, sling, hot pot holder, etc.  
      
    
- Duct Tape & Paracord: These are like universal repair and construction materials. Uses are virtually endless: mend gear, make tools, restrain something, build shelter, first aid (splints, blisters), you name it.  
      
    
- Trash Bags (Contractor Grade): Can be made into a poncho, water collector, ground cloth, makeshift pack, or for waterproofing gear. Also essential for sanitation (to line toilets or carry waste).  
      
    
- Tarps: As mentioned before – not just shelter, but rain catchment, wrap for carrying supplies, partition in a room, or even folded as stretcher.  
      
    
- Clothing Layers: A wool blanket can be bedding, clothing, shade, or even cut into smaller pieces for insulation in boots or around pipes. Similarly, aluminum foil in kits can be used for cooking, signaling, electronics shielding, etc.  
      
    
- Pot with Lid: Cook food, boil water, sanitize instruments, carry water, use lid as plate, dig if needed, even use as noise-maker to signal.  
      
    
- Smartphones (with downloaded resources): In normal times, a phone is a tool for communication, navigation (GPS), information (PDF manuals, offline maps), light (flashlight app), and documentation (camera). FPA encourages maximizing the utility of devices by storing data and apps that work offline.  
      
    
- Bungee Cords & Zip Ties: Temporary fixers for gear and infrastructure – from bundling firewood to securing a splinted limb, their uses are myriad.  
    By packing and highlighting these multipurpose items, the Alliance ensures each piece of gear in a kit pulls its weight in several ways. It’s a very resource-efficient mindset: when a new gadget is considered, they ask “can something we already carry do this job?” Often the answer is yes with a bit of creativity, and that creative approach is constantly cultivated among members.
