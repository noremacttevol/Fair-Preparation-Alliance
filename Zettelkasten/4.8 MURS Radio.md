## 4.8 MURS Radio

Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS) is another license-free option that FPA can leverage for local communications. MURS has a few distinct advantages: it operates on VHF frequencies (which can have slightly better range in open areas compared to FRS’s UHF) and allows for use of external antennas and higher-end radio units as long as they’re under 2 watts. FPA includes MURS in its communication toolkit especially for medium-range needs – for example, coordinating between vehicles in a convoy, or communication on a homestead property and the surrounding area. With only 5 channels available, MURS is a relatively quiet band (less consumer traffic than FRS), which can be a benefit during emergencies to avoid interference. Members using MURS might set up a base antenna at home to extend range, effectively creating a mini-neighborhood network. It’s also compatible with certain devices like VHF business radios, giving flexibility in gear. The alliance’s comm plan might assign a specific purpose to MURS channels, say Channel 1 for a local chapter’s emergency use. As with other radios, members practice MURS usage in drills, so even those without ham licenses can cover decent distances by combining MURS radios with good antenna setups. In summary, MURS offers an intermediate-range, reliable channel that enhances FPA’s layered comms without licensing hurdles.
