## 7.13 Skill Database (Member Skills & Expertise)

FPA recognizes that among its greatest resources are the diverse skills of its members. To leverage this, they maintain a Skill Database – essentially a directory of who knows what. This database (likely a spreadsheet or section in the vault) lists members and their particular areas of expertise, certifications, or practical skills. For example, it will note who is a certified EMT or nurse, who’s a licensed ham radio operator ([[4.6 Amateur (Ham) Radio]]), who has construction or plumbing experience, who speaks foreign languages, and so on. It might also include hobbies that could be useful (gardening, hunting, sewing, programming). In an emergency, this allows leadership to quickly identify “subject matter experts” to consult or put in charge of certain tasks (injury? find the highest medical-skilled person available; setting up a water filter system? find the engineer or the person who did it before). This skill inventory is updated as members gain new qualifications (for instance, if someone takes a CERT course or a wilderness survival class, that gets added). The Alliance encourages members to cross-train, but also to own their niche – everyone knows who the “radio guy” or “mechanic gal” is in their local chapter. The Skill Database also helps in planning: if a chapter sees they have no one knowledgeable in, say, wild foraging, they might seek out training or recruit someone new with that skill. It’s also a morale booster – members feel valued for the skills they bring, not just seen as generic bodies. Privacy is respected (the skill list isn’t public-facing outside FPA), but within the group it’s accessible so that even if people haven’t met, they know “Oh, Alice is our herbal medicine guru, I’ll reach out to her for this question.” By mapping out human capabilities, FPA ensures that knowledge isn’t just in documents, but embodied in people and that those people can be identified and tapped when their know-how is needed most. It turns the alliance into a well-rounded team where one person’s strength covers another’s weakness, and collectively, they have an expert in nearly every facet of survival and resilience.
