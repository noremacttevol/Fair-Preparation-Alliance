## 1.14 Founding and Historical Background

  

The Fair Preparation Alliance was founded in response to the realization that isolated individual prepping had limitations and that a united, fair-minded coalition could significantly improve everyone’s chances in a disaster. In the early days of FPA (Phase 1 of its development), a small group of seasoned preppers – noticing growing threats from natural disasters, societal strains, and technology vulnerabilities – began meeting to share knowledge and support each other’s plans. These founders (one of whom, for instance, goes by “Jamie” and later became known as a key instructor and consultant for the Alliance) drafted the initial principles that would become FPA’s charter. They were concerned about the “uneven” nature of preparedness: some people had extensive resources while others had knowledge but little gear, etc., and saw an opportunity to even the playing field by pooling strengths. The name “Fair Preparation Alliance” itself signals the intent to make prepping cooperative and just. Early on, around its founding (circa the early 2020s), FPA operated quietly as a local network in a few regions, testing out collaboration models and documenting best practices (which evolved into the [[“SHTF Bible” Comprehensive Manual]] and the [[Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)]]). Notably, an important historical milestone was when the founders introduced the multi-phase framework (Mark I Mod 1 at that time) – dividing the Alliance’s growth and action plan into phases. After initial small-scale success and refinement (Mark I Mod II introduced more formal roles and the beginnings of the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] concept), FPA expanded via word of mouth and discreet outreach. By the time of Mark I Mod III (the current framework), the Alliance had grown beyond its original locale to a national footprint with numerous chapters and a recognized internal culture (trust, fairness, tech-augmented prep). Over time, certain events underscored the need for FPA’s approach: for example, when a severe hurricane hit one of the regions where FPA had members, the coordination and mutual aid those members provided (compared to non-associated preppers who struggled alone) proved the model. Such experiences strengthened resolve and attracted more members after the fact. FPA’s history is also marked by technological adaptation – early use of standard social media gave way to the creation of proprietary platforms as concerns about censorship and reliability grew, pushing the development of Realnet. Through all these changes, the Alliance stayed low-profile publicly, focusing on building capacity quietly. The founding ethos – that working together fairly beats surviving alone – has been validated in small crises and drills, but the Alliance continually prepares for larger challenges to truly prove that vision. The historical lessons learned (documented in internal retrospectives and the [[Evolution of FPA Strategy]]) continue to inform current strategy, reminding members of why FPA was formed and how far it has come from a handful of neighbors sharing tips to a nationwide alliance with a comprehensive plan for the worst of times. (See: [[Evolution of FPA Strategy]] for the formal changes from Mk1 Mod1 to Mod3, and [[Challenges and Lessons Learned]] for key takeaways from FPA’s journey.)
