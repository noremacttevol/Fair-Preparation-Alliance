## 7.45 Gear for Special Needs & Family Members

Preparedness gear isn’t one-size-fits-all; FPA puts special emphasis on accommodating all members of a household:

- Children: Kits are adapted for kids’ capacities and needs. For example, a child might have their own small backpack with light items (a water bottle, whistle, a comfort item like a stuffed toy, and some snacks) so they feel involved but aren’t overburdened. Parents’ gear will include child-specific supplies: diapers and wipes for infants, formula or baby food, child-size masks, medicines in child doses, and items to occupy them (coloring book, small game) during stressful downtime.  
      
    
- Elderly or Disabled: Mobility aids (spare cane, walker, wheelchair repair kit, etc.) are part of plans. If someone uses hearing aids, extra batteries or a spare device go into kits. For the visually impaired, glasses backups or mobility canes are secured. Those on medical devices like oxygen concentrators or CPAP machines must plan power backups (battery or manual alternative if possible). FPA helps families create lists of this specialized gear and ensure it’s ready to go. They also may acquire lightweight portable versions of equipment (like a portable oxygen tank) for emergencies.  
      
    
- Medical Needs: Any unique medical necessities (dialysis equipment, insulin and refrigeration for it – possibly a small cooler with ice packs in the go-bag) are addressed with redundancy (extra medication supply) and contingency (what to do if device-dependent care isn’t available).  
      
    
- Pets: Gear for pets is often included here as well – a leash, pet carrier, collapsible bowls, pet food supply, copies of vaccination records, and pet medications. Also sanitation (waste bags, litter for cats). FPA encourages pet owners to practice evacuating with their pets and ensure they have muzzles if needed (even friendly pets can panic).  
      
    
- Emotional Comfort: For those with anxiety or conditions exacerbated by stress, having comforting items (favorite blanket, fidget device, spiritual text) is recognized as legitimate gear too.  
    FPA’s inclusive approach in gear prep means no member is left struggling because the standard kit list didn’t cover their condition. They maintain checklists for various scenarios (pregnancy, chronic illness, infants) so families can customize effectively. By planning for special needs, the Alliance ensures that everyone – young, old, or with health challenges – has the necessary supplies to stay safe and well during emergencies, and that caregivers have the tools to support them under duress. This upholds the “fair” in Fair Preparation: preparedness for all, not just the most able-bodied.
