## 6.15 Future Outlook & Emerging Tech

Looking ahead, FPA keeps an eye on emerging technologies and trends that could shape the future of preparedness. They monitor developments like Starlink and other satellite constellations – while currently requiring infrastructure, in the future miniaturized satellite communicators might allow affordable two-way global texting for groups. They watch the progress of battery technology (solid state batteries, improvements in solar efficiency) because better energy storage directly improves resilience. The alliance is also interested in nanotechnology and materials science as it pertains to gear – for example, new lightweight water filtration membranes or insulating materials could revolutionize personal equipment. Decentralized web technologies (like blockchain or IPFS) are on their radar for possibly distributing information without central servers, though these are young. Another area is biotech in medicine – things like portable DNA/RNA testers or lab-on-chip devices that could help identify diseases or toxins in the field could be game changers for community health during crises. FPA fosters relationships (or at least information exchange) with universities, tech startups, and the wider maker community, effectively acting as beta testers or early adopters for anything that aligns with their mission. They also forecast societal changes: for instance, how climate change might introduce new emergencies and what innovations will be needed to cope (e.g., better wildfire monitoring sensors, or resilient cooling systems during heatwaves). In the vault, there’s a “horizon scanning” note that gets periodically updated with news on these cutting-edge topics. By preparing for possible futures, the Alliance tries to be ahead of the curve – so that when a new tech matures, they’re ready to integrate it, and if a new challenge arises, they’ve perhaps already scouted a tool or method to meet it. This forward-looking stance ensures FPA remains at the innovative forefront of preparedness, continuously evolving its practices not just from lessons of the past but also from the promises of the future.
