## 4.13 Reticulum & Alternative Networks

As part of future-forward planning, FPA keeps an eye on alternative networking protocols like Reticulum, dubbed the “prepper’s internet.” Reticulum is an open-source network stack designed to run on anything from laptops to Raspberry Pis, creating a resilient data network over whatever links are available (radio, Wi-Fi, etc.). By using Reticulum or similar systems, the Alliance could send encrypted messages, share files, or maintain a bulletin-board style service (like a local BBS) without the traditional Internet. Some tech-savvy members experiment with this: for instance, setting up a small server running Reticulum and connecting it via long-range radio to neighboring communities, effectively bridging separate mesh networks into a larger “Outernet.” These alternative networks are in early adoption, but they promise a way to keep digital communication alive in extreme scenarios by operating on top of ad-hoc links. FPA documents how to set up such systems in the knowledge vault, including necessary hardware (like modems, antennas) and software configs, so that if mainstream options fail, those with the capability can spin up a Reticulum node and help form a clandestine network for the Alliance. Embracing these cutting-edge solutions aligns with FPA’s innovative spirit – ensuring members have access to information channels that are truly independent of centralized control or infrastructure.
