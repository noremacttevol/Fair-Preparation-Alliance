## 7.25 Food Preparation Gear

Cooking and preparing food off-grid requires specialized but simple gear:

- Stove: A compact camping stove (propane/butane or multi-fuel) for quick cooking. Many also have a wood-burning rocket stove or gasifier stove that uses twigs as fuel – crucial when propane runs out.  
      
    
- Cookware: Sturdy pots and pans (cast iron for hearth/fire use, or nested lightweight metal pots for portability). Also utensils, a knife dedicated to food prep, cutting board, and a stirring spoon/spatula.  
      
    
- Eating gear: Durable plates/bowls, mugs, and cutlery (often camping mess kits). Each member usually has a personal set in their kit.  
      
    
- Fuel & ignition: Adequate propane canisters or fuel tablets, and for wood stoves, tinder kits. Long lighters or matches to start stoves safely.  
      
    
- Cleanup: Biodegradable soap, scrubbers, and a dish basin. Sanitation in cooking is vital to prevent illness when medical help might be far – so gear to boil water for dish sterilization or a pressure cooker (which doubles for sterilizing instruments) might be included.  
    This gear allows members to cook staples from their stores (rice, beans, canned goods) and even bake basic bread (many keep a camp oven or improvise with a dutch oven). With it, they can maintain a hot meal routine which is essential for morale and nutrition.
