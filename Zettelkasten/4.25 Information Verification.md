## 4.25 Information Verification

In a crisis, rumors and unverified reports can spread quickly, potentially causing dangerous decisions based on bad info. FPA tackles this by instilling a discipline of information verification. When a member hears or receives critical information (like “the water supply station is contaminated” or “evacuation is ordered for our area”), they are expected to verify it through at least one other reliable source before the group acts on it. This might mean quickly checking an official alert channel (such as a government emergency alert, local news, or NOAA radio) to see if the info is confirmed. If time allows, another member might independently confirm by contacting a trusted external contact. Within the network, if a report is relayed from one chapter to another, the origin is cited (“This is from Jane via her contact in the fire department”) so everyone knows the credibility. The Alliance likely has a role similar to an intelligence officer – someone assigned to gather and vet info and label it as confirmed or tentative. Miscommunication can also occur, so repeating back messages for confirmation is standard (“Copy that: you said the bridge on Route 6 is out, correct?”). When forwarding information, members tag it appropriately: e.g., “UNCONFIRMED: saw on social media that grocery is open, anyone verify?” This way the team can weight their decisions. In training, FPA sometimes injects a false rumor to see if members catch it and verify before responding. The goal is to avoid the pitfalls of panic and misinformation; by valuing accuracy over speed when it comes to intel, the group ensures that its actions are based on reality, not hearsay, which in emergencies can literally be a life-saving difference.
