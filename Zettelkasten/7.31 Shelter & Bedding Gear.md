## 7.31 Shelter & Bedding Gear

If members must sleep outside their normal homes (whether in the field or in a community shelter), FPA ensures they have proper shelter and bedding:

- Tents: Lightweight backpacking tents for those on the move, and larger family tents for group sites. Many carry at least a bivvy or tarp shelter in their kits. Group caches might include heavy-duty tents (like military surplus GP medium tents or large pop-up canopies) to house multiple people. Repair kits (fabric patches, pole splints) are included.  
      
    
- Tarps & Poles: Even with a tent, tarps are invaluable for additional rain cover, creating communal areas, or ground cover. Adjustable poles or rope allow them to be fashioned into various shelters. FPA often practices building tarp shelters (lean-tos, teepees, etc.).  
      
    
- Sleeping Bags: Rated to appropriate temperature ranges for the region (e.g., a 0°F bag for cold climates). In warmer areas, lighter bags or just fleece blankets might suffice with the option to layer clothing. Stored loosely when not in use to preserve loft. Accompanied by a sleeping pad (foam or inflatable) for insulation from the ground and comfort – this significantly improves rest quality and warmth.  
      
    
- Bivouac Gear: Emergency bivvy sacks (reflective bivvies, basically durable space blankets in bag form) are carried by many as backups. These can be life-saving if someone is caught without a tent.  
      
    
- Camp Bedding: If feasible, cots or hammocks (with mosquito netting in buggy climates) are used in base camps for comfort. Hammocks double as improvised chairs and keep one off wet ground, but need trees or stands.  
      
    
- Heating/Cooling: In cold: portable tent stoves (for those with sturdy tents) or at least safe heat sources and ample blankets. In heat: battery fans, shade tarps, and knowledge of ventilation setups.  
    With this gear, members can establish a dry, warm (or cool) and safe sleeping environment almost anywhere. FPA emphasizes the importance of quality sleep even in crises, so having reliable shelter and bedding is not luxury but necessity to keep everyone functional and healthy.
