## 7.32 Clothing & Protective Equipment

Appropriate clothing can mean the difference between comfort and catastrophe, so FPA has guidelines for essential garments and protective gear:

- Seasonal Clothing: Members maintain sturdy outdoor clothing suitable for their climate: insulated jackets, hats, and gloves for winter; sun hats, light long-sleeve shirts for summer. Rain gear (waterproof jacket, pants, poncho) is must-have to prevent hypothermia or misery during storms. Extra socks (wool or synthetic) are heavily emphasized to keep feet dry and blister-free.  
      
    
- Footwear: Broken-in, durable boots or shoes designed for long treks and rough terrain. In every kit, a spare set of socks and even spare shoelaces are packed. If boots get wet, having dry alternates (or at least waterproof gaiters) helps. Some keep compact sneakers or water shoes if needing to cross streams or give feet a break.  
      
    
- Work Gloves: Tough gloves for clearing debris, handling hot items, or building shelter – protect against cuts and blisters.  
      
    
- Eye Protection: Safety glasses or goggles, especially for those likely to do labor (cutting wood, clearing rubble) or in high-dust scenarios.  
      
    
- Masks/Respirators: N95 or better masks in kits for smoke, dust, or disease outbreak. In wildfire-prone areas or urban disaster scenarios, having a half-face respirator with P100 filters is recommended.  
      
    
- High-Vis and Hard Hats: For working near roads or in collapsed-building scenarios, a high-visibility vest and a hard hat are part of community gear. CERT vests and helmets often double for this purpose among FPA volunteers aiding public response.  
      
    
- Thermal Regulation: Items like a shemagh or bandana (multi-use for sun, dust, warmth), warming layers (fleece, wool base layers), and cooling scarves for heat waves.  
    The Alliance motto for clothing is “Cotton kills” – favor wool or synthetics that insulate when wet. They have each member test their gear in adverse conditions (a rainy hike, a cold night out) to trust its performance. By having the right clothing and PPE, FPA members enhance their resilience against the elements and physical hazards, staying protected, dry, and visible as needed in any operation.
