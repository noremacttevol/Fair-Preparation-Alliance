## 2.2.1 Phase 1: Early Organization & Preparedness

  

Phase 1 is the Alliance’s formative stage, corresponding to “normal” times (before any major SHTF event). In this phase, FPA’s focus is on building the network and ensuring every member is as prepared as possible. Key activities in Phase 1 include:

  

Recruitment and Vetting: Identifying like-minded individuals and bringing them into FPA (see [[Recruitment Strategy]] and [[Vetting and Screening Process]]). Growth is steady and cautious to maintain trust.

  

Training and Skill Development: Members engage in regular training sessions – from first aid classes, navigation and wilderness survival practice, to technical workshops on radio communication. The [[Training and Skills Development Program]] lays out a curriculum of essential prepper skills everyone should attain during Phase 1.

  

Knowledge Consolidation: The alliance compiles and distributes vital information. The creation of the [[“Whole Book” Master Documentation]] happens in this phase – a compendium of all FPA protocols, guides, and references. Also, the [[“SHTF Bible” Comprehensive Manual]] (covering scenario-specific knowledge) is written/assembled. Members study these materials and contribute their expertise to continuously refine them.

  

Resource Gathering: Members individually and sometimes cooperatively stockpile needed supplies according to the [[Approved Gear List Overview]]. During Phase 1, the emphasis is on each member achieving a baseline of preparedness (water, food, medical supplies for their household for a certain duration, personal defense tools, etc.). FPA facilitates this by providing the gear list, discount opportunities (if the alliance arranges group buys), and guidance on efficient prepping on various budgets.

  

Community Building: Trust and cohesion are built through regular meet-ups and activities ([[Member Meetings and Events]]). Chapters often hold monthly meetings, group hikes, field exercises, or just social gatherings (barbecues, etc.) – these serve to bond members and identify strengths/weaknesses in the group. By Phase 2, members should know each other well and function as a team; Phase 1 is when that familiarity is established.

  

Communications Setup: In Phase 1, FPA uses common platforms (encrypted messaging apps, email lists, maybe a private forum). However, they also prepare the infrastructure for Phase 2’s Realnet and practice using alternative comms in case mainstream systems fail. For instance, members obtain ham radio licenses and start holding practice nets on weekends ([[Ham Radio Network]] usage begins as a hobby/training activity in Phase 1).

  

Drills and Scenario Planning: Chapters conduct periodic drills (e.g., a “bug-out weekend” simulation where everyone practices packing and meeting at a rally point, or a communications blackout drill using only radios for 24 hours). These exercises reveal gaps and reinforce readiness. Also, members develop personal/family emergency plans and then use the [[“Test My Plan” Program]] to have those plans reviewed and stress-tested by peers.

  

OPSEC and Low Profile: Throughout Phase 1, FPA keeps a low profile publicly ([[Public Outreach and OPSEC in Communication]] guidelines ensure members don’t inadvertently expose the group). Members may be encouraged not to advertise their affiliation; any community outreach is framed in generic preparedness terms, not “here is our secret alliance”. This ensures that when things are normal, FPA doesn’t attract thieves or undue scrutiny, and members avoid becoming targets for having supplies.

The outcome of Phase 1 is that by the time a serious crisis looms, FPA has a robust foundation: a well-organized membership, trained and equipped, bound by trust and clear plans. Everyone knows their role, their team ([[Buddy Teams and Cell Structure]] might be assigned during this phase), and the triggers that will move the group into Phase 2 mode. Phase 1 could last indefinitely until an emergency hits – FPA operates in this mode continuously, steadily improving. It’s often said within FPA, “Phase 1 is 90% of success”, meaning the work done now determines outcomes later. If done right, Phase 1 ensures that when alarms go off, Phase 2 will activate smoothly like a well-oiled machine. (Preparedness checklists, training logs, and community maps created in Phase 1 are referenced in [[Resource Management and Logistics]] and [[Scenario Planning and Threat Modeling]].)
