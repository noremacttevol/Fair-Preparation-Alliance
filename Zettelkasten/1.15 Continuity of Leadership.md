## 1.15 Continuity of Leadership

  

FPA recognizes that in crisis scenarios, normal leadership channels may be disrupted – leaders could be out of contact, injured, or in a different location when an emergency strikes. Therefore, continuity of leadership is planned at all levels to ensure the Alliance can function under duress. This means each key leadership role has a designated backup or succession plan. At the national level, the Leadership Council has an order of succession: if the primary coordinator (e.g., FPA’s chair or head) is unavailable, a deputy or next senior member takes charge of national coordination. These contingencies are documented and known to the council members themselves (for security, the full succession list might not be widely published, but chapter leaders know whom to contact if the usual point of contact is silent). At the local level, chapter leads often have an assistant lead or a core group of two or three members who can collectively lead if needed. For example, if a chapter lead is traveling or incapacitated during a crisis, a previously agreed-upon member steps up to organize the group’s response. FPA also trains all members in basic leadership and decision-making, fostering a culture where anyone can take initiative if they must. This is important because in a chaotic situation, the person on the spot might need to make immediate calls (following FPA principles and plans) without waiting for orders. The Alliance encourages decentralized execution of its plans: since everyone has access to the knowledge base and SOP, even if cut off from leaders, members know what needs to be done. There is also a protocol that if communications fail, local groups act autonomously to implement the Phase 2 emergency plans and later reconnect when possible ([[Emergency Activation Protocols]] cover triggers for autonomous action). To support continuity, leadership information (like emergency contact methods for leaders and backups) is stored in the secure [[Data Security and Backups]] system – for instance, every chapter might have a sealed envelope or encrypted file with instructions “If you cannot reach any higher command, do X,” which includes the next link in leadership. Drills sometimes simulate loss of leadership: e.g., in an exercise, the chapter lead might deliberately step back to let the deputy run the show, ensuring readiness. Moreover, cross-training is encouraged – multiple people know how to handle communications gear, logistics, etc., so that losing one specialist doesn’t cripple the group ([[Specialized Teams and Task Forces]] always have overlap in skills). This redundancy of leadership and skills ensures resilience. Ultimately, FPA’s goal is that no single point of failure – including a person – can derail the Alliance’s functioning. If one leader falls, another picks up the flag, so to speak. This gives members confidence that the group will remain organized even in worst-case scenarios. It’s often stressed: “The plan leads, not just the person,” meaning the Alliance’s prepared framework (the Mark I Mod III plan) guides everyone, with or without the usual leaders present. (Cross-reference: [[Strategic Plan Overview (3-Phase Approach)]] which outlines broad actions any group can take if cut off, and [[Coordination Structure and Chain of Command]] for how alternate command is structured.)
