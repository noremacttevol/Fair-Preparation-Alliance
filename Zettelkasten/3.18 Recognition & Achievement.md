## 3.18 Recognition & Achievement

While FPA is not about rank or competition, it acknowledges that recognizing achievements can motivate members and build morale. The Alliance may have an informal badge or certification system to mark milestones (for example, when a member becomes a licensed ham radio operator, completes a CERT training course, or masters wilderness first aid). These achievements might be celebrated at meetings or in newsletters, highlighting the member’s contribution (“Congrats to Alex for getting CERT-certified – a huge asset to our community!”). Recognition is always framed in terms of how it benefits the group, reinforcing values of service over ego. Occasionally, friendly challenges or goals are set – like a “72-hour kit improvement month” where those who bring their emergency kit up to a high standard get a shout-out. By celebrating progress and thanking volunteers for their efforts, FPA maintains positive engagement. Members feel their effort matters, and this encouragement sustains long-term involvement and the continuous improvement of skills and preparedness levels.
