## 2.6 Operational Security (OPSEC) Measures

  

OPSEC refers to the practices FPA uses to protect sensitive information and plans from falling into the wrong hands. Given that knowledge of who has what supplies or where members are gathering could be exploited by malicious actors (looters, hostile groups, or even overly curious authorities), FPA places strong emphasis on OPSEC throughout its operations. Key OPSEC measures include: Need-to-Know Information Sharing – Members are only given information relevant to their role or local area. For example, a member knows the identities and addresses of their immediate chapter mates but might not know members in a distant chapter unless necessary (so if one member is compromised, they can’t expose the whole network). Similarly, details of caches or backup routes are compartmentalized. Use of Codes and Codenames – In communications, especially over potentially monitored channels like radio, FPA uses pre-arranged codewords for locations, people, or statuses. For instance, a chapter might refer to their meetup spot as “Depot Blue” instead of the actual name, or use a phrase like “The weather is stormy” to indicate a certain security threat level without alerting outsiders. Each chapter might have variations of codes, and the [[Communication Protocols and Etiquette]] note outlines how to use them. Cover Stories – Members are encouraged to have a benign explanation for their preparedness activities. If someone asks why they have so much food stored, they might say they bulk-buy to save money or run a pantry for charity. If asked about group meetings, they could describe it as a camping/outdoors club. This way, they don’t advertise FPA but also don’t appear secretive, which could arouse suspicion. Discretion in Public – When conducting training exercises or meet-ups, OPSEC means doing so without drawing undue attention. A firearms training might just look like a normal day at the shooting range, a radio drill might occur on ham frequencies blending in with normal traffic, a group hike could just look recreational. Any overt discussion of SHTF scenarios is kept within private settings. Secure Storage of Documents – Physical and digital documents (membership lists, plans) are protected. Printed docs are kept in locked containers (and often in duplicate in separate locations in case one is lost). Digital files are encrypted, perhaps with tools that all members are taught to use. The Realnet itself is designed with security in mind – it may use encrypted messaging boards accessible only to members with login tokens, possibly even running on a darknet or closed network to avoid external observation. Monitoring for Leaks – FPA leadership quietly monitors for any## 2.6 Operational Security (OPSEC) Measures

OPSEC refers to the practices FPA uses to protect sensitive information and plans from falling into the wrong hands. Given that knowledge of who has what supplies or where members are gathering could be exploited by malicious actors (looters, hostile groups, or even overly curious authorities), FPA places strong emphasis on OPSEC throughout its operations. Key OPSEC measures include: Need-to-Know Information Sharing – Members are only given information relevant to their role or local area. For example, a member knows the identities and addresses of their immediate chapter mates but might not know details about distant chapters unless necessary (so if one member is compromised, they can’t expose the whole network). Similarly, details of supply caches or evacuation routes are compartmentalized; only those involved in maintaining or using a cache know its exact location. Use of Codes and Codenames – In communications, especially over potentially monitored channels like radio, FPA uses pre-arranged codewords for locations, people, or statuses. For instance, a chapter might refer to their meetup spot as “Depot Blue” instead of the actual name, or use a phrase like “checking on Aunt Mae” to signify checking a particular cache or safehouse. Each chapter develops a set of brevity codes (often updated periodically) for key messages to avoid giving away intent to eavesdroppers (detailed in [[Communication Protocols and Etiquette]]). Cover Stories – Members are encouraged to have a benign explanation for their preparedness activities. If someone asks why they have so much food stored, they might say they bulk-buy to save money or run a food pantry. If questioned about group meetings, they could describe it as a “community safety club” or hobby group (without detailing the survival aspect). This way, members don’t advertise FPA but also don’t appear overly secretive, which could arouse suspicion. Discretion in Public – When conducting training or operations, FPA keeps a low profile. A field training might just look like a camping trip. Ham radio practice might blend in with normal amateur radio chatter. Members avoid wearing any kind of uniform or emblem in Phase 1 and 2 that could mark them as part of a network. In short, don’t draw unnecessary attention is the rule. Secure Record-Keeping – Sensitive documents (membership lists, contact info, plans) are stored securely. Digital data is encrypted (the Realnet likely has built-in encryption for group chats and file sharing). Physical notebooks (for those who prefer analog backups from the [[Knowledge Management Strategy]]) are kept under lock and key. Some chapters use “dead drop” methods for passing physical messages or USB drives in Phase 2 if digital comms are compromised, with pre-arranged inconspicuous locations. Monitoring and Counter-Intelligence – FPA leadership quietly monitors for any OPSEC breaches. For example, if a member inadvertently posted something on social media about prepping, a senior member would remind them of the privacy policy and have them remove it. In Phase 2, if there are rumors in the local area about a “group with supplies,” FPA will adapt – possibly moving supplies or changing codes – to mitigate any leak. Members are also advised to be alert for anyone showing undue interest in their activities; infiltration attempts are countered by the vetting process and by not revealing too much too soon to new contacts. Operational Guidelines During Crises – In an active crisis (Phase 2), OPSEC ramps up further. Movement of groups is done covertly when possible (e.g., traveling at night or via less-traveled routes to rally points). Fires or lights are shielded to avoid detection. Communication on open channels might deliberately include misinformation or be minimized if hostile scavenger groups are known to be scanning. Each member knows a cover story for why they might be on the move (“heading to family”), to deflect inquiries. The alliance has contingency plans if they suspect they’ve been compromised (like relocating a meeting site, or in worst case scattering and regrouping later). The balance FPA strikes is between secrecy and effectiveness: members need enough info to act, but not so much that a single breach endangers everyone. These OPSEC measures are drilled into members from day one – it’s part of the culture of trust that you protect each other’s privacy and security. By rigorously following OPSEC, FPA increases its survivability; enemies cannot easily target what they cannot pin down. (Cross-ref: [[Member Privacy and Data Security]] focuses on individual data protection, which overlaps OPSEC. Also [[Ham Radio Network]] and [[Communication Security (COMSEC)]] notes detail specific comm security tactics.)
