## 7.21 Get-Home Bag

Complementing the Bug-Out Bag, FPA also advises members to maintain a Get-Home Bag – a smaller kit intended to help one return home (or to a safe location) if disaster strikes while they’re out. Many people spend a good part of the day at work, school, or on the road, so this kit is often kept in one’s car, office locker, or carried daily if feasible. A Get-Home Bag typically is lighter than a full BOB, built for perhaps 24 hours of support. It includes:

- Water & Food: a bottle of water (or collapsible bladder) and some high-energy snacks (granola bars, jerky). Possibly a filter straw in case one needs to drink from a stream or public source.  
      
    
- Comfortable walking gear: if you normally wear dress shoes or heels, the get-home bag should have a pair of walking shoes and socks. Also seasonally appropriate items like a poncho or sun hat.  
      
    
- Navigation & Comms: a map of the local area marking multiple routes home (including on foot routes cutting through if roads are jammed) and a compass. A whistle and small radio (to monitor news or communicate).  
      
    
- Personal safety gear: pepper spray or another defensive tool if appropriate, plus a headlamp for moving at night and a reflective vest (so cars see you, or to signal).  
      
    
- First Aid & Hygiene: a compact first aid kit for blisters, small injuries, and any needed personal meds (like an inhaler or insulin and snacks for diabetics). Also wet wipes or sanitizer (one might be moving through dust or debris).  
      
    
- Cash & Copies: some cash in case of power outage affecting card payments, and copies of IDs/emergency contacts if you need to prove identity or get through checkpoints.  
      
    
- Tools: a multi-tool or small knife, a pry bar (some carry a small crowbar in car kits to get out of or into structures if needed), and dust mask and goggles (particularly for urban folks concerned about building damage or subway tunnel evacuations).  
      
    
- Fire & shelter: usually not a full tent, but maybe an emergency blanket or bivvy and a way to start fire if absolutely stuck overnight outdoors.  
    The philosophy is that if something goes down (transit outage, sudden riot, natural disaster), you can hoof it home safely. This bag assumes you’re not planning to camp out for long – just to get to your main supplies or loved ones. FPA’s training includes planning “get-home routes” and rendezvous if family members are scattered. Members often keep get-home kits in their vehicles (along with comfy clothes and walking shoes). If they commute, they know at least two ways home (one might be longer but safer). The get-home bag is a bit of insurance to bridge the gap between the moment of crisis and reaching home base or group rally point. By prepping this, FPA reduces the chance of members being stranded or becoming victims when trying to regroup – it turns commuters into confident travelers under duress who can navigate chaos and reach the safety of home or community with the aid of their trusty little kit.
