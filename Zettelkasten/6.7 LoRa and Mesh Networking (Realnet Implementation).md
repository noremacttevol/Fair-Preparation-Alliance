## 6.7 LoRa and Mesh Networking (Realnet Implementation)

Implementing Realnet on the ground often comes down to leveraging LoRa (Long Range Radio) and other mesh-friendly tech to link everyone. LoRa, known for its long-range, low-bandwidth capabilities, is perfect for text-based messaging networks. FPA sets up LoRa nodes using devices like Meshtastic or LoRa APRS trackers, where each member’s device not only sends/receives their messages but can also forward others’ messages (mesh behavior). The Alliance configures these with agreed frequencies and encryption keys so that their communications remain private within the group. Additionally, they experiment with off-the-shelf mesh products: for example, goTenna devices which pair with smartphones to allow off-grid SMS among a group, or specialized firmware (like BATMAN or Babel) on Wi-Fi routers to auto-connect multiple houses in a neighborhood. Setting up a robust Realnet might involve putting a node on a high point, say an antenna on a tall tree or building that links distant subnets of the mesh together by line-of-sight radio links. FPA’s technically inclined members might also deploy small single-board computers at key locations to act as mesh “servers” – these could host a local bulletin board system (BBS) or chat room accessible to everyone on the mesh. The Alliance tests Realnet by sending dummy messages across town solely via these hops, refining the node placement when messages don’t get through. Power backup for each node is arranged (like battery or solar hats on the LoRa modules) so the network stays up through outages. A fully realized Realnet might allow someone in Chapter East to send a digital note to Chapter West without cell service – it hops through intermediate chapter nodes along the way. This is essentially creating a community intranet: you could post a “need help at X location” on a local server and others will see it and respond, or share files like PDFs of a repair manual to all connected nodes. LoRa in particular might carry short updates hundreds of kilometers if meshed well and with high antennas – connecting even spread-out rural members. Through hands-on building of these networks, FPA turns the abstract idea of a “backup internet” into a tangible reality, giving the group an independent digital nervous system that persists even when the outside signals die.
