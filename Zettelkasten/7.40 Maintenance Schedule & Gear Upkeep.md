## 7.40 Maintenance Schedule & Gear Upkeep

Gear is only as good as its condition, so FPA emphasizes regular maintenance:

- Inspection Checklists: The Alliance provides checklists for members to routinely inspect their gear (e.g., every 6 months or with seasons). This includes checking batteries (and replacing or recharging them), looking for corrosion or wear on tools, ensuring filters haven’t expired, and confirming fuel stores are stabilized.  
      
    
- Rotation of Supplies: Food, medicine, and batteries are rotated out before expiration. Many use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method in their storage pantry, consuming older stocks in everyday life and restocking with fresh supplies. Fuel in generators or vehicles is used and refilled periodically to keep it fresh.  
      
    
- Cleaning and Repairs: After any field use or annually if in storage, items like tents, sleeping bags, water containers, and clothing are cleaned and properly dried to prevent mildew or deterioration. Tools are oiled, knives sharpened, firearms cleaned and lubed. Water filters are sanitized and dried per manufacturer guidance (or replaced if at end-of-life). Electronics are powered up to ensure capacitors, etc., still work and firmwares are updated if applicable.  
      
    
- Upgrade and Evaluate: Part of upkeep is deciding if gear should be upgraded. FPA encourages members to report gear failures or shortcomings, so the “approved list” can be revised. For example, if a particular flashlight model has consistently shown a weak switch after a year, they’ll advise switching brands.  
      
    
- Caches Maintenance: As mentioned, caches are also on a maintenance schedule – a team will discreetly check a cache location, verify seals are intact, no animals have burrowed in, and contents are up to date.  
      
    
- Documentation: Members keep a log (physical or digital) of their gear checks. This ensures nothing is overlooked for too long and also provides a record in case something goes missing or is loaned out.  
    By instilling a maintenance culture, FPA avoids nasty surprises like dead batteries in a flashlight during a blackout or a rusty stove that won’t light at a campsite. Gear failures in crises can be life-threatening, so prevention is key. The alliance sometimes holds “maintenance parties” where they collectively service gear – making it social and educational. The end result is a cadre of equipment that’s reliable and ready to perform as intended, and members who are intimately familiar with their gear’s condition and operation.
