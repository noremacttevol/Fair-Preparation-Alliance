## 7.17 Standardization of Gear

To improve coordination and maintenance, FPA promotes some degree of gear standardization among its members. This doesn’t mean everyone must buy the exact same brand of every item, but rather identifying key gear where uniformity brings benefits. For example, communications: if most of the group uses a particular model of handheld radio, they can share batteries, chargers, and knowledge on programming it easily. So FPA might bulk-buy a popular Baofeng or Midland radio model and offer them at cost to members, recommending that as a standard. Another area is connectors and parts – they encourage using the same fuel syphons, same battery types, same water filter thread sizes (many filters use standard bottle threads), etc., to maximize interchangeability. In group caches, standardized gear is a must: all first aid kits might be stocked identically so anyone grabbing one knows exactly what’s inside, or all tents are similar model so setting them up is straightforward for any member. Even with vehicles, if possible, having similar models in a chapter can simplify carrying spares or doing repairs (though this is harder to control). The Alliance creates gear lists and specs as guidelines – like a recommended list for a 72-hr bag where certain brands/models are suggested – aligning what people carry. Standardization also aids training; if everyone has a similar water purifier, a single demo covers all. Importantly, they don’t enforce this top-down; rather, through the collective testing and “approved gear list” process, members naturally coalesce around the gear that’s proven to work and is widely accessible. They maintain a pool of spare parts for standardized items (like replacement o-rings for the group’s water filters, or spare tubes for the common radio antennas). There’s also a marking system: standardized gear can be color-coded or labeled so it’s immediately recognizable (for instance, all FPA radios might have an orange sticker). In crisis, this reduces confusion – any member can pick up any kit or tool and use it competently. By standardizing where it counts, FPA increases their logistical efficiency and resilience, ensuring that critical systems are compatible and simplifying the complex puzzle of managing many different items under stress.
