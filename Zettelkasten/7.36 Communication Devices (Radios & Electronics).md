## 7.36 Communication Devices (Radios & Electronics)

To keep lines of communication open, FPA prioritizes equipping members with the right comms devices (tying into category 4 details but focusing on gear):

- Handheld Radios: Most members have a handheld FRS/GMRS radio for local comms (easy to use, no license for FRS). Many also invest in dual-band ham handhelds which can hit repeaters or do simplex over longer range (with the understanding they’ll get licensed or at least use in emergency). Standardizing models (as per [[7.17 Standardization of Gear]]) allows battery and accessory sharing.  
      
    
- Mobile/Base Radios: At home or in vehicles, more powerful mobile radios (25-50W) are installed by some, with antennas on the roof, to serve as chapter net control stations or reach distant members. These usually cover HAM bands (VHF/UHF) and possibly CB.  
      
    
- CB Radios: Truck and car units for CB are in the vehicle kit for many, plus a portable CB for base camp – useful in caravans and to communicate with outsiders like truckers during highway evacuations.  
      
    
- Satellite Phones/Messengers: Though expensive, a few devices are shared as group gear. A sat phone can be rotated among leaders to check in with out-of-area contacts when cell networks fail. Satellite text messengers (Garmin InReach, etc.) are more common since they are cheaper – at least one per chapter to send/receive 160-char messages via satellite.  
      
    
- Signal Boosters: In weak signal areas, some have cellular boosters in cars or for home, and radio repeaters (even portable ones like duplexers with two radios) for extending ham/GMRS range during an event.  
      
    
- Antennas: Various collapsible antennas (taller whip antennas for handhelds, magnet-mount mobile antennas, roll-up J-pole antennas made of twin-lead for field expedient use) are part of comms kits to improve range substantially when deployed.  
      
    
- Accessories: Spare batteries, solar chargers (as noted in power gear), and headsets (earpiece/mic) for radios so communications can be done quietly and hands-free when needed.  
    With these devices, FPA ensures that each member can stay connected with the team through layers of comm options. Drills include practicing relaying messages through different devices (maybe starting on cell phone, switching to radio, etc.). The communications gear is one of the most vital categories of equipment because it binds the group together in action, so the Alliance spares no effort in procuring and training with these tools.
