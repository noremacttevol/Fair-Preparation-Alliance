## 4.3.3 Emergency Communication Plan (Phase 3 – Blackout)

Phase 3 (Black-Sky Total Failure): When conventional communications are down across the board (no phone service, no internet), FPA’s plan relies on fully off-grid methods. Ham radio nets take center stage: licensed amateur operators among the members initiate scheduled nets (e.g., three times a day) on pre-assigned frequencies, acting as information hubs for those with receivers. Locally, members use two-way radios (FRS/GMRS or MURS) for short-range coordination – possibly employing a relay system where messages hop from one neighborhood to another via intermediate operators. If available, satellite messengers or phones ([[4.10 Satellite Communication Devices]]) might be used sparingly (due to limited bandwidth or cost) to get critical messages in or out of the region, like sending a brief status to an out-of-state contact or requesting external aid. In Phase 3, FPA may also revert to physical messaging: establishing rally points where written bulletins are posted, or using couriers (trusted individuals moving between groups on foot, bicycle, or vehicle) to carry USB drives or notes ([[4.14 Sneakernet & Physical Message Relay]]). Communication in this phase is kept short and essential, often using pre-agreed code words for common messages to save time (for example, a code for “I’m safe and with group” or “need help at location X”). Despite the challenges, the Phase 3 plan ensures that even in a blackout, the alliance maintains a flow of information – however primitive – so that coordination and mutual aid can continue.
