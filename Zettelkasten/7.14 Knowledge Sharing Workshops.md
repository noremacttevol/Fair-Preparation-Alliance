## 7.14 Knowledge Sharing Workshops

While documents and data are crucial, FPA also believes in the power of in-person (or live) knowledge sharing. They regularly host workshops where members teach each other – effectively turning the community into a living library of skills. These workshops range from formal classes (like a weekend course on emergency first aid or canning and food preservation) to casual skill-share circles (like a show-and-tell of everyone’s favorite knot or a discussion of lessons from a recent book someone read). Not only do these events transfer practical knowledge, but they also allow Q&A, hands-on practice, and relationship building (which makes people more comfortable asking for advice later). FPA might invite outside experts too – perhaps a local firefighter gives a class on fire suppression, or a horticulturist teaches about wild edibles. All workshops are typically summarized in the Knowledge Vault (tying back to [[7.8 Training Resources Archive]]), but the interpersonal aspect is key: members often remember things better having done them or seen them in action than just reading about them. There’s also an emphasis on scenario-based learning: an experienced member could run a mini scenario (“it’s winter, power is out, how do we keep warm?”) and the group brainstorms, sharing tips and solutions – everyone learns new tricks. These gatherings can be at chapter meetings or larger regional meetups. Sometimes they’re themed (Communications Day, Medical Day, etc.). The alliance encourages every member to occasionally step up and share something – even if it’s a small hack or a personal experience story, as these add to collective wisdom. By fostering an environment where knowledge sharing is frequent and fun, FPA ensures that important skills are not siloed; multiple people get to learn them. It also keeps members engaged and constantly learning even in peacetime. In essence, the workshops make sure the knowledge in the vault is translated into action and muscle memory, and that the community stays vibrant and cohesive through the continuous exchange of know-how.
