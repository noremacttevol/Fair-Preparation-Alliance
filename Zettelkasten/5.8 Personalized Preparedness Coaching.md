## 5.8 Personalized Preparedness Coaching

AI isn’t just for big-picture analysis; it also can operate at the individual level, helping members tailor their preparedness. FPA might provide members access to an AI-based preparedness coach – essentially a chatbot or app that converses with them to improve their personal plan. This AI could ask the member questions about their household, location, skills, and resources, and then suggest what areas to focus on. For example, if someone lives in an apartment without a car, the AI coach might emphasize planning for shelter-in-place and public evacuation transport options, whereas for someone with medical training, it might encourage them to be the go-to medic of their chapter and ensure they have extra trauma supplies. It might also keep track of to-do lists: “Your water supply is only 10 gallons, which is below the recommended 30 gallons for your family size; consider increasing it,” or reminders like “It’s been 6 months, time to rotate your stored gasoline.” By analyzing best practices and maybe cross-referencing what similar households have done, it can provide pretty detailed suggestions. The AI could even simulate how prepared you are: e.g., run a quick scenario (“If a blackout happened right now, based on what you told me, you’d run out of food in 5 days. Perhaps consider storing more canned goods.”). This personalized feedback helps each member continually improve in a targeted way, as opposed to generic advice. It’s like having a prep consultant available anytime. For FPA, this means overall readiness of members can increase more uniformly – those who might not know where to start get guided step by step. It also frees human mentors a bit; they can focus on advanced skill training while the AI handles the basic checklist coaching. In essence, each member gets a customized plan and gentle push to stay on track, courtesy of an AI that knows all the best practices and adapts them to that person’s life.
