## 4.27 Logging Communication

During extended incidents, FPA makes sure to keep a log of communications. This practice serves multiple purposes: it provides a record for later review (what decisions were made when), it helps if someone needs to catch up on the situation, and it can be vital if information needs to be handed to authorities or other groups. Typically, the person in a Communications Officer role ([[4.21 Team Communication Roles]]) will jot down key points: time a message was received, who it was from, and a brief summary (e.g., “18:42 – HQ: Chapter B safe, moving to Location Z.”). In a radio net, this is often called a radio log or comm log. For text-based communications (like group SMS or chat), the log might simply be the saved thread, but if the situation is evolving fast, one member may consolidate critical events into a timeline document. Everyone is encouraged to keep personal notes too, especially if they are receiving a lot of info. The Alliance uses standardized forms where possible – perhaps adapting ICS (Incident Command System) forms like the Unit Log (ICS-214) for their own use. Logs are considered sensitive, so they’re handled with care (a log might reveal names and locations; thus once things settle, those logs are stored securely in the knowledge archive or destroyed if appropriate). Logging also reduces confusion: if someone thinks a message might not have gotten through, the comms person can confirm from the log whether it was transmitted and acknowledged. At the end of an event, these logs help in debriefings to reconstruct what happened. Ultimately, maintaining a written or typed record means the group isn’t relying purely on memory in a chaotic scenario – there’s a paper trail (digital or physical) of what was communicated, which is invaluable for accountability and learning.
