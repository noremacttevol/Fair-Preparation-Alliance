## 3.15 Roles in Emergency (Phase Transitions)

When an emergency strikes or escalates (moving from a normal day into a crisis phase), FPA members know how to pivot in their roles. In the early warning stage (Phase 1 turning to Phase 2), leadership will often activate an incident command structure informally: the communications lead might initiate a group alert, regional coordinators start accounting for members, and the logistics person checks readiness of supplies. As the situation intensifies (entering Phase 3), the structure may simplify for agility – local chapter leads take charge of on-the-ground decisions since central coordination might be cut off due to communication outages. Pre-defined contingencies cover this: for example, if no outside contact, a local group proceeds to a rally point or safe location autonomously. Each member is aware of what to do if leaders are unreachable – typically, follow the last known plan and prioritize safety of people over things. In essence, roles remain but adapt: a member who was just training others in normal times might now be actively treating injuries or securing resources. Everyone understands the mantra, “lead when you must, follow when you can”, ensuring continuity of operations without confusion through all phases of an emergency.
