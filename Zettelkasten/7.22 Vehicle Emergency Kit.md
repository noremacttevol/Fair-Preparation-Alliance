## 7.22 Vehicle Emergency Kit

Since many emergencies involve or affect travel, FPA advises members to keep a Vehicle Emergency Kit in their cars (or other personal vehicles). This kit ensures that if you’re on the road during a crisis (or even just a mundane breakdown), you have the tools and supplies to stay safe, get moving again, or survive until help comes. A well-stocked vehicle kit includes:

- Car essentials: Jumper cables, a spare tire (in good condition) with jack and tire iron, tire repair kit or fix-a-flat, and a portable air compressor. Fluids like engine oil, coolant, brake fluid – small amounts for topping off if needed.  
      
    
- Tools: a wrench, screwdrivers, pliers, duct tape, zip ties, and a multitool – enough for basic repairs or makeshift fixes (like reattaching a loose hose).  
      
    
- Recovery and signaling: tow strap, a folding shovel (in winter areas, also kitty litter or sand for traction; in off-road areas, traction mats), and road flares/reflective triangles to signal if you’re broken down. Also a hi-visibility vest.  
      
    
- Navigation backup: physical map/atlas of the region in case GPS fails, and a compass. In remote areas, a PLB (personal locator beacon) or satellite messenger might be in the glovebox for true emergencies.  
      
    
- Comfort and survival: Blankets (or sleeping bag), extra clothes (consider season; a coat, hat and gloves for winter; sun shade hat for summer), and a few hand warmers. Also an umbrella or poncho for rain.  
      
    
- Food and water: a gallon of water (which can double for radiator or washing use, but primarily drinking) and some durable snacks (protein bars, nuts). Also maybe a small stove or metal cup to heat water if stranded overnight (plus those emergency ration bars that withstand car heat).  
      
    
- Lighting and power: a flashlight (preferably hand-crank or with spare batteries), and if possible, a car escape tool that includes a seatbelt cutter and window breaker (kept within reach of driver). Also a phone charger (car adapter).  
      
    
- First Aid and hygiene: a car-sized first aid kit (often more supplies than a BOB version, including splint, burn gel, etc.), sanitation bags or a portable toilet solution for long waits, paper towels or rags, and heavy-duty gloves.  
      
    
- Fuel and fluids: if safe/legal, maybe a jerry can of fuel (or at least an empty one to fetch fuel) and a siphon pump. In cold climates, a small can of de-icer or starting fluid.  
    FPA’s guidance also covers maintenance: checking the kit regularly, rotating food/water, making sure nothing got used and not replaced (like that one time you gave someone a jump, are your cables back in place?). They encourage fueling up often (not letting tank drop below half) to extend range if evacuation hits. For multi-vehicle families, each car gets a kit plus tailored items (if one is the designated evacuation vehicle, maybe extra roof rack with storage, etc.). By prepping cars, the Alliance ensures members can handle roadside issues and evacuations more smoothly. Vehicles often serve as both transport and temporary shelter, so a well-prepared car can be the difference between an inconvenience and a life-threatening ordeal on the road.
