## 7.12 Access in Emergencies

Having a trove of information is futile if people can’t access it when needed, so FPA plans carefully for knowledge access during emergencies. This involves multiple strategies:

- Distributed Copies: Key info (like emergency action checklists, comms frequencies, medical protocols) is distributed to members beforehand in printed form or pocket reference cards. Each team leader might carry a USB with the vault on their keychain.  
      
    
- Offline Servers: As noted in offline repositories, some chapters maintain a battery-powered mini server or even just a tablet that anyone can use on the spot to look up data. For instance, at a basecamp or shelter, they might set up a laptop as a kiosk with the vault and offline library open for reference.  
      
    
- Radio Broadcasts of Info: An innovative practice is that FPA can use radio to share knowledge on the fly – say there’s an outbreak and people need to know how to sanitize water, a ham operator might literally read the procedure on-air at regular intervals, turning radio into an audio library. Or they use slow-scan TV or digital text modes to transmit specific documents to others who can’t directly access the vault.  
      
    
- Emergency “Cheat Sheets”: The Alliance prepares concise field guides for the most likely scenarios. For example, a hurricane kit might include a laminated sheet of “What to do when the hurricane hits” steps. These cheat sheets boil down info from the vault into immediately actionable checklists or diagrams that are easy to follow under stress.  
      
    
- Buddy System for Info: They also encourage that less experienced members pair up with veterans in emergencies. If someone doesn’t have direct access to the knowledge base, their buddy does and can guide them.  
      
    
- Caching Knowledge with Gear: In gear caches, not only are supplies stored but also instructions for using them. A medical kit might have a first-aid booklet, a generator in storage has a laminated start-up guide attached, etc.  
    During drills, FPA tests how quickly someone can retrieve needed info without internet or power. They simulate, for example, “Find how to treat cholera from our materials” and see if the person finds the answer in printed binders or offline files efficiently. These practices refine how info is packaged and labeled. Ultimately, the goal is that no member is left guessing in a crisis; even if personal electronics fail, the community ensures knowledge is reachable – through shared printouts, communal devices, or good old communication. In essence, FPA designs redundancy not just in comms and gear, but in knowledge delivery, so the right instructions and information reach the right people at the right time, even in dire conditions.
