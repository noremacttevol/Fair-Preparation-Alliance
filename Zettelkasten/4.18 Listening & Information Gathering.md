## 4.18 Listening & Information Gathering

Effective communication isn’t just about speaking or sending — it’s also about listening and gathering intelligence. FPA trains members to be good listeners on multiple levels. First, technically: members learn to use devices like scanners or multi-band radios to monitor emergency frequencies (police, fire, EMS dispatch, weather NOAA channels). This way, they can gather real-time info on what first responders or authorities are doing. Secondly, members monitor news sources and social media (during Phase 1/2 when available) to spot early warnings or community reports (for example, someone in a neighborhood forum posting about a power outage could tip off the group that trouble is brewing locally). The Alliance also emphasizes verifying information: if a rumor comes through (like “the highway bridge is down”), someone is assigned to double-check via a second source or even physically if possible before the whole group acts on it ([[4.25 Information Verification]]). In radio terms, being a good listener means maintaining radio discipline: not interrupting unless urgent and copying down messages accurately. FPA often has a member or two act as dedicated “ears” during an incident – their job might be to do nothing but listen to official channels or news updates and then feed relevant information to the group comms (like “Net Control, this is Sam with an info update: weather service issued new tornado warning…”). This prevents information overload, as not everyone has to monitor everything — they trust the delegated listener. By honing listening skills and systems, the Alliance ensures it’s not operating in an information vacuum; instead, it stays as informed as possible about the broader situation, enabling better decision making.
