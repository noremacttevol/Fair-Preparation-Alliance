## 6.6 Satellite Data Reception (Outernet Implementation)

To make the Outernet concept practical, FPA invests in satellite data receivers and related tools. Typically, this involves a small satellite dish or flat-panel antenna, an LNB (low-noise block converter) to capture the signal, and a receiver like the Othernet’s Dreamcatcher board or even a repurposed TV satellite receiver with custom firmware. The Alliance often builds kits: a portable box with the antenna and receiver, plus a low-power computer (like a Raspberry Pi) that decodes the satellite stream and stores incoming files. Solar panels or battery packs are included to ensure it works off-grid. Setting up satellite reception requires pointing the antenna to the correct part of the sky (where the broadcast satellite is geostationary for KU-band systems, or tracking if it’s LEO). FPA provides members with training on aiming antennas and maintaining the link – using compass, inclinometer, and signal strength feedback. Once locked on, the data just flows automatically: a rotating carousel of content beamed by the Outernet service or similar. The kind of content received might be daily news summaries, weather maps, chunks of Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap data, encryption keys, or even messages if the service supports a bulletin feature. The Alliance coordinates with these service providers when possible (or follows online updates) to know what content to expect and how to request certain topics. Because the received data can be a lot, there’s a process to curate and share it: one member may specialize in filtering through the day’s Outernet download and then posting highlights onto the Realnet or printing important bits for those without digital devices. During trials, FPA has successfully pulled down things like first aid manuals, NOAA weather forecasts, and even entertainment content (for morale). This capability means that even if completely cut off physically, the group has a drip-feed of fresh information and knowledge. Satellite reception thus is a cornerstone innovation in the Alliance – bridging the gap between the isolated ground reality and the wealth of human knowledge orbiting above.
