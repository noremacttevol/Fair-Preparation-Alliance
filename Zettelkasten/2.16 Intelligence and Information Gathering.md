## 2.16 Intelligence and Information Gathering

  

Staying informed is critical during crises, so FPA has a proactive approach to gathering intelligence (intel) and situational awareness. In stable times, members keep an eye on emerging threats (news of pandemics, economic indicators, weather forecasts), but in an active emergency, this kicks into high gear. Monitoring Official Channels: Early in a crisis, members will tune in to emergency broadcasts (NOAA weather radio, local news radio, TV if available, official alerts on cell phones) to get the latest instructions and developments. Each chapter often assigns someone to continuously monitor these and relay important info to the group via [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] or radio. For example, if a mandatory evacuation of certain zones is ordered, or if a boil-water advisory is issued, they ensure all members know. Scanning and Ham Radio Intel: Many FPA members are ham radio operators and have scanners. They’ll listen to public service frequencies (police, fire, EMS) if not encrypted, to glean real-time info on what’s happening (e.g., locations of unrest, progression of a wildfire, etc.). They also monitor amateur radio bands where other operators might be reporting local conditions. FPA might have relationships with radio nets (like neighborhood radio watch or regional prepper nets) and exchange reports. For instance, an FPA ham might check in to a statewide emergency net and get information from other counties or transmit a request (like asking if a certain highway is open). Crowdsourced Intelligence: Through the Realnet or other online means (when available), FPA gathers intel from its own members and allies across regions. Each member reports what they personally observe: “Bridge on Route 5 collapsed,” “The grocery store in town was emptied by 10 AM,” “Military convoy seen heading north,” etc. These are compiled to build a picture. A designated intelligence coordinator (even informally, someone good at synthesizing info) might maintain a whiteboard or digital pad with key info points and updates for the leadership to use in decision-making. Social Media and Internet (Phase 1 and early Phase 2): If internet is still up, some members will scan Twitter, Facebook groups, Nextdoor, etc., which can provide hyper-local updates (sometimes faster than official news). Knowing which sources are credible is important; FPA might have a list of reliable local Twitter accounts or community pages to check. However, they also guard against misinformation, cross-verifying anything critical via other means if possible. Recon and Observation: FPA doesn’t rely solely on passive intel. They will sometimes send out members for reconnaissance if safe. For example, if they haven’t heard news about a nearby town where another chapter is, they might dispatch a two-person team in a vehicle to go check it out and come back with reports. Or in a localized scenario, if they want to know if looters are in the area, members might take turns doing watch patrols around the neighborhood or vantage points (using binoculars, etc.). These scouts keep the group informed of any incoming threats (like “there’s a large fire two miles south” or “a group of armed individuals were spotted heading this way”). Use of Technology: Some tech-savvy members may employ tools like drone surveillance (if they have a drone, flying it to see road conditions or check on a nearby property), or digital tools like emergency scanner apps, satellite messengers (for getting texts out if cell is down), or even connecting to amateur radio email (Winlink) to receive situation reports from afar. If the crisis is widespread, they might tap into networks like ARRL bulletins or SATCOM (satellite phones, if any member has one) for outside world news. Analysis and Dissemination: Raw info is not enough; FPA discusses what the intel means. If, for instance, the scanner indicates law enforcement is pulling out of certain areas, FPA infers those areas will be lawless and maybe to avoid them. If weather reports show incoming heavy rain after a quake, they prepare for landslides or mud. The intelligence coordinator might brief the group at set times (like at evening gatherings: “Here’s what we know today”). They also use this intel to update their plan – maybe delaying a move by a day because intel shows traffic jams, or accelerating it because a situation is deteriorating. Maintaining Secrecy: While gathering info, FPA is careful when sharing outside the group. Members might talk on ham radio nets, but they won’t reveal critical internal info during those exchanges. They’ll mostly collect data and keep any sensitive commentary to closed channels. On the Realnet or internal comms, they emphasize encryption if possible so their analysis of intel (which might mention their plans) isn’t intercepted. Intel Sharing with Allies: If FPA has allied groups or friendly neighbors, they might share some intelligence with them to help the wider community (for example, informing a neighboring community network that a river’s dam upstream broke, so they can evacuate). This is done when it doesn’t compromise FPA’s position. Conversely, they welcome intel from others – e.g., a friendly police officer member might feed them extra info off-duty, or a utility worker friend could whisper where power will be restored first. FPA values these human intel sources highly. Avoiding Rumors: With everyone scared and gossip rampant, FPA makes a conscious effort to verify info. They adopt a bit of a chain-of-trust: if intel is uncertain, they label it as such and might seek a second source. They discourage spreading unvetted rumors among members, as that can cause panic. The intelligence lead might literally say, “Treat this next part as unconfirmed: there’s a rumor of looting in the west side, but we have no direct evidence yet.” By structuring communications this way, members maintain trust in the intel process and don’t overreact to hearsay. In conclusion, FPA treats information as a vital resource – almost as important as food or water. Their coordinated intelligence efforts mean they often know more about what’s happening than the average person, giving them a strategic advantage in making decisions. This is especially crucial when official channels are silent or overwhelmed. The motto could be: “Information is survival.” (Cross-ref: [[Communication Strategy and Layers]] – intelligence gathering relies on those communication methods, and [[Continuous Improvement and AARs]] – after events, the intel process itself is reviewed for what info they missed or misinterpreted, improving future intel operations.)
