## 1.4 National Leadership Structure

  

At the national level, FPA is overseen by a National Leadership Council composed of experienced members who have demonstrated dedication and expertise in various domains (such as logistics, communications, medical, etc.). This council often includes the founders or early organizers of FPA and any appointed officers for key functions. The national leadership’s role is to articulate strategy, maintain the Alliance’s vision, and coordinate large-scale initiatives that span across local groups. They develop core frameworks like the [[Mark I Mod III Framework (Current Plan)]] and phase-based strategy, and ensure each region has the guidance needed for implementation. Decision-making at the national level typically involves consensus-building within this council (see [[Decision-Making Process]]), taking into account input from regional coordinators. National leaders also manage external relationships on behalf of FPA – for instance, discreetly communicating with other networks or monitoring national-level threats (tying into [[Alliances and External Coordination]] and intel gathering). They uphold accountability by reporting to the broader membership on the state of the Alliance (transparency is key – see [[Accountability and Transparency]]). Importantly, the national structure is not authoritarian; it serves the members by providing support, not by issuing top-down orders. In practice, the national team often facilitates knowledge-sharing (like distributing the combined [[“Whole Book” Master Documentation]] or updates to the [[SHTF Bible]]), organizes nationwide training events or communications drills, and spearheads innovations (like rolling out the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] infrastructure). This structure is designed so that if one leader is incapacitated or unreachable, others can fill the role ([[Continuity of Leadership]]), keeping the Alliance functional under stress. (See also: [[Member Participation in Governance]] for how members influence national decisions, and [[Plan Updates and Versioning]] for how leadership handles evolving strategy.)
