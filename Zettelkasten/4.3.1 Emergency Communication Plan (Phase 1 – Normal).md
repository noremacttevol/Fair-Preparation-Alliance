## 4.3.1 Emergency Communication Plan (Phase 1 – Normal)

Phase 1 (Blue-Sky Normal): In normal times or when an incident is just developing, FPA’s communication plan leverages all mainstream channels with an emphasis on rapid awareness. Members are reachable via mobile phone calls, SMS, messaging apps, and email. A typical plan might designate a primary group chat (secure messaging app or email list) for routine updates or alerts. Everyone keeps important numbers saved and perhaps carries a wallet card of key contacts (borrowing from ready.gov guidance that each person carry plan info). If a potential threat is detected (like severe weather warnings), an agreed alert message (e.g., a specific phrase or code) is sent to notify all members to stand by. During Phase 1, the goal is to confirm who’s available and monitor the situation. Internet-based collaboration tools (like a shared document or map) may be used to log status reports. The plan assumes infrastructure is up, but also prepares members for possible transition: reminders might be issued like “Keep your radio on Channel X in case cell service fails.” In essence, Phase 1 uses everyday tech while quietly prepping everyone to shift to backup modes if needed.
