# 08. User Application & Journey Strategy (Mk1 Mod 3)

**Version:** Mk1 Mod 3-2025-05-07  
**Status:** Operational Draft  
**Maintainer:** Membership & Onboarding WG  
**Index:** [[Wiki Index]] ▸ Onboarding

---

## Purpose  
Define a phased, offline-resilient pathway that moves an interested citizen from first contact to fully active FPA member while reinforcing trust, culture, and progression at every step.

## Guiding Principles  
- **Offline-First** — every critical step survives grid failure.  
- **Human-Verified Trust** — AI assists; humans decide.  
- **Progression = Proof** — rank and reputation stem from logged action.  
- **Decentralize Early** — squads self-govern as soon as practical.  
- **Radical Transparency** — [[Live Audit Feed]] exposes decisions, data flows, and finances.

## Phase Matrix  

| Phase | Scale Target | Primary Gate | Key Outputs | Governance |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Phase 1 – Manual Pilot** | 0–10 k | Human approval | Printable quick-start, first radio check | National Admin |
| **Phase 2 – AI-Assisted Growth** | 10 k–50 k | AI + Human review | Adaptive onboarding, squad match, live rank tracker | Admin + Regional |
| **Phase 3 – Autonomous Network** | 50 k + | Community vote + referral | Peer-led onboarding, squad self-management | Squads & Regions |

---

## Phase 1 — Manual Pilot

### Application  
1. **2-Minute Form** — callsign/name, email, ZIP.  
2. **Admin Review Queue** — approve/reject with note.  
3. **Welcome Packet** — links to [[Compass Guide]], PDF quick-start, squad invite.

### Onboarding  
- Complete basic profile.  
- Join or seed a [[Squad]].  
- Conduct first HAM radio check on regional net.  
- Run one starter task via [[Test My Plan]].  
- Print personal binder (“SHTF packet”).

**Success Gate:** binder printed + radio check ⇒ **Rank E-1**.

## Phase 2 — AI-Assisted Growth

### Smart Application Flow  

| Field | Purpose | AI Rule |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Gear tip (≤25 w) | screens hands-on mindset | ≥2 prep keywords |
| Motivation (≤50 w) | values alignment | ≥3 ethos keywords |
| Skills checklist | squad matching | populates [[Skill Wheel]] |

AI triage → **Green** (auto-approve) · **Yellow** (regional review < 48 h) · **Red** (spam/reject).

### Adaptive Onboarding  
1. Persona-aware greeting.  
2. Baseline [[Skill Wheel]] self-assessment.  
3. Gear audit + instant risk report.  
4. Squad match or creation.  
5. Comms tutorial + radio check.  
6. First engagement (drill, post, quiz).

Completion unlocks **Rank E-2** eligibility.

### Scaling Features  
- Stripe recurring fee ($5 → dynamic drop).  
- **Live Audit Feed** transparency.  
- “Start-a-Squad” blueprint + regional mentor link.  
- Peer sign-offs + photo proof.  
- Trust Firewall button on all AI outputs.

## Phase 3 — Autonomous Network

### Community-Led Onboarding  
- Referral codes accelerate approval.  
- Yellow queue handled by regional councils.  
- Squads vote-in locals after probation.

### Squad Self-Management  
- Governance panel: roles, drill log, vote engine.  
- Decentralized promotions/demotions (criteria-locked).  
- Succession drills (“Leader Down”) every 6 mo.

### Regional & National Layer  
- Elected regional leads coordinate multi-squad ops.  
- Fees drop to $1 at 100 k; sponsor model by vote.  
- National team: AI corpus updates, Outernet feeds, by-law polls.

## Trust & Culture Hooks  

| Journey Point | Culture Mechanism |
|---------------|------------------|
| Application | Gear tip + motivation = value signal |
| Onboarding | Mandatory [[Compass Guide]] checkpoint |
| Progression | Logged drills + peer verification |
| Governance | [[Trust Doctrine]] override councils |
| Tech Oversight | Trust Firewall patch notes to all |

---

## Offline-Resilience Checklist  
- All onboarding PDFs auto-export printable.  
- Weekly national HAM broadcast schedule in welcome packet.  
- Binder print reminder every 90 days.  
- Squad rally point + analog contact logged.  
- Quarterly Outernet/SAT protocol push.

---

## Implementation Roadmap (dev-facing)

1. **Sprint 0** – form, admin queue, email template.  
2. **Sprint 1** – PWA caching, binder export.  
3. **Sprint 2** – Stripe, rank tracker, squad DB.  
4. **Sprint 3** – AI vetting micro-service, Yellow queue UI.  
5. **Sprint 4** – squad governance panel, peer sign-off logic.
