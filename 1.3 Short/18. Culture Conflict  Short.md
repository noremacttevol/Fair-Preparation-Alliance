## 1 · Purpose

Provide a pocket guide to spotting, defusing, and learning from internal conflict while hardening FPA against fragmentation. Each concept links to deeper notes; every definition gets a one-liner here.

---

## 2 · Quick Glossary (one-liners)

- **[[Culture Conflict]]** — Any clash of values, roles, or expectations inside FPA.
    
- **[[Trust Doctrine]]** — Ethical code anchoring honesty, goodwill, and due process.
    
- **[[TERM:Trust_Firewall]]** — Minimum trust score before escalation auto-triggers.
    
- **[[Trust Escalation Chain]]** — Step-ladder for repeated breaches (Warn → Mediation → Firewall).
    
- **[[Trust Firewall Protocol]]** — Containment measures for major trust violations.
    
- **[[Pause Protocol]]** — Any member may halt work to address urgent ethical or interpersonal risk.
    
- **[[Squad]] / **[[Circle]] / **[[Movement Council]]** — Nested units for conflict handling (local → regional → alliance).
    
- **[[Trust Liaison]]** — Neutral peer mediator at circle level.
    
- **[[OpCheck]]** — Readiness sweep; includes “team pulse” indicator.
    
- **[[Alliance Points]]** — Merit currency; earned for constructive conflict handling.

## 3 · Guiding Principles (snapshot)

|#|Principle|1-line Reminder|
|---|---|---|
|1|Trust First|Assume good intent until evidence says otherwise.|
|2|Honesty + Respect|Speak truth to the issue, not attacks to the person.|
|3|Peer Accountability|No one is above the process—call issues early.|
|4|Fairness|Neutral mediators; evidence over politics.|
|5|Constructive Growth|Conflict is data that strengthens culture.|

---

## 4 · 3-Level Conflict Flow

|Level|Scope|Key Steps|Gate to Next|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Squad**|Peer clash|Direct talk → in-squad mediation|Stalemate > 48 h or misconduct claim|
|**Circle**|Multi-squad / unresolved|Trust Liaison facilitation → Circle panel|Panel deadlock OR high-impact issue|
|**Movement**|Cross-circle / systemic|Cross-circle panel → Movement Council ruling|Council decision is final (unless policy vote)|

_🛑 Pause Protocol_ can be invoked at any level to freeze work until mediation starts.

## 5 · Lightning Checklist for Mediators

1. Confirm parties know & accept the **process path**.
    
2. Frame discussion with **Compass**: _Why are we here?_
    
3. Enforce **ground rules**: respect, no cross-talk.
    
4. Surface **interests**, not positions.
    
5. Draft **written agreement** + follow-up date.
    
6. Log summary in [[Live Audit Feed]] (omit sensitive details).
    
7. Award **Alliance Points** (+5 each) if both uphold pact for 30 days.

## 6 · Anti-Abuse Safeguards

|Risk|Guard-Rail|
|---|---|
|Retaliation|Zero-tolerance; report to Circle panel anonymously if needed.|
|Biased mediator|Mandatory recusal → alternate mediator pool.|
|Process gaming|Pattern triggers review by Culture WG + potential rank freeze.|

---

## 7 · Learning Loop

1. Conflict closed → **After-Action Review** within 14 days.
    
2. Lessons tagged `#ConflictLearn` in [[FPAKM]].
    
3. Patterns flagged quarterly to Governance WG for SOP tweaks.

## 8 · Self-Critique (2025-05-07)

1. **Glossary trimmed** to 10 core terms; run vault audit for niche terms like _Ombudsperson_.
    
2. **Level gates** simplified—may omit some nuance (e.g., whistleblower path) pending WG sign-off.
    
3. **Alliance Points values** left provisional (see Outreach note).
    
4. **Pause abuse check**: consider 3-strike rule in future update.
