## 1 · Why It Matters

Readiness is a **system**, not a vibe. This note shows how FPA ramps from daily calm to full System Override, so every squad knows _what to do, when, and who’s in charge_—even if the grid dies.

---

## 2 · Quick Glossary (10 terms)

- **ORP Phases** — Passive · Prepared · Active · System Override.
    
- **Three‑Tier Readiness** — Personal ▸ Squad ▸ Community checkpoints.
    
- **OpCheck** — Go/No‑Go checklist before any deployment.
    
- **Comm Pulse Check** — Daily 7.200 MHz HAM heartbeat.
    
- **System Override** — Phase‑4 SOP when digital fails; analog takes over.
    
- **Offline Activation Kit** — Binder + radio + power that runs the alliance in the dark.
    
- **Tier I‑III Kits** — Standardised gear sets tied to rank.
    
- **Dark Drill** — 12–24 h radio‑only ops test.
    
- **Squad Scorecard** — Quarterly readiness metrics sent to circles.
    
- **Emergency Trigger** — Grid 48 h, AI fail, or silent leadership ⇒ Phase 4.

## 3 · ORP Phase Ladder (macro)

|Phase|Ops Posture|Trigger|Command Shift|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1 Passive**|Skill‑building, low‑stakes drills|Normal day‑to‑day|National → squads|
|**2 Prepared**|Gear confirm, local sync|Early threat signals|Regional amplifies|
|**3 Active**|Kits staged, nets live|Crisis near 100 mi|Squad autonomy ↑|
|**4 Override**|Offline SOPs, analog tasking|Grid 48 h, AI fail, silence|Local leads rule|

|---|---|---|
|**OpCheck**|Final green‑light before missions|[[15. SOP Checklist]]|
|**Tier Kits**|Gear tiers tied to rank|[[19. Gear List & Endorsements]]|

## 5 · Emergency Trigger Actions (Phase 4)

1. **Switch to Offline Kit** (binder, radios, task cards).
    
2. **Start Comm Pulse** at 07:00 & 19:00 local.
    
3. **Activate Backup Leader** via paper trust chain.
    
4. **Deploy Task Cards** & keep radio logs.
    
5. **Daily Paper Backup** for later digital sync.

## 6 · Required Drills for Rank ≥ E‑3

|Drill|Goal|Cadence|
|---|---|---|
|Dark Drill|Prove radio‑only ops|Annual|
|Print Drill|Refresh offline docs|Semi‑annual|
|Task Drill|Test analog tasking & backup lead|Quarterly|

Miss one ⇒ rank freeze until makeup.

## 7 · Offline Hooks

- ORP ladder & Phase‑4 SOP laminated in every binder.
    
- USB with vault export rides in Tier III kits.
    
- HAM net recaps ORP status every Sunday “Ops Minute.”

## Self‑Critique (2025‑05‑07)

1. **Phase table** condensed; full doc has detailed escalation logic.
    
2. **Glossary limited to top 10**; niche terms like _Scout Role_ remain in full view.
    
3. **Drill cadence** mirrors full doc; WG can adjust per region.
    
4. **Scorecard linkage** points to Rank Matrix; may need its own short view later.

## Change Log

|Date|Version|Change|
|---|---|---|
|2025‑05‑07|v1 Short View|Condensed operational readiness guide created.|

<!-- Clarification Insert (Top of File) -->
> 🔁 **Offline-First (Clarified)** – Design principle requiring all tools, protocols, and workflows to function with zero internet connectivity. Emphasizes durability during grid-down scenarios. Includes print/PDF fallbacks, radio protocols, and local caching systems.

> 🔁 **AI Firewall (Clarified)** – A rule-based buffer system that intercepts, logs, and holds any AI-generated suggestion flagged as high-risk until cleared by human moderators. Designed to ensure trust, prevent misuse, and maintain ethical AI boundaries across all FPA systems.

> 🔁 **Trust Doctrine (Clarified)** – A multi-layer ethics and enforcement framework ensuring internal accountability, member integrity, and non-violence. Coordinates with AI Firewall and Tribunal protocols. [[See also: Compass Guide, Alignment & Trust Protocols]]
