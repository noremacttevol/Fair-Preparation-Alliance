**Looking at file content**

It looks like the user's provided file is huge, with 900+ lines of content, including suggestions and patch sections. It seems like this might be the original draft rather than a rewritten version. The assistant repeated the earlier sections but didn't provide the rewrite for file 10, which is needed. I should fetch the content for "10. Core Innovations" to reference before working on the new version. I'll aim to condense and standardize the content, while summarizing key innovations.

**Structuring Core Innovations**

The content outlines 12 core innovations with categories like purpose, implementation, and a 30-day roadmap. I need to clarify and interlink these innovations, standardize the structure, and avoid creating new models. The rewrite should provide a summary of each innovation with links to more detailed notes. I should use a table of innovations with brief descriptions, an implementation matrix, and offline-first considerations. I'll include citations and focus on maintaining the original meaning without extensive rewriting or unnecessary details. Time to format the content accordingly!

# 10. Core Innovations Doctrine (Mk1 Mod 3)

**Version:** Mk1 Mod 3-2025-05-07  
**Status:** Operational Draft  
**Maintainer:** Innovation & R&D Working Group  
**Index:** [[Wiki Index]] ▸ Strategy ▸ Core Innovations  

---

## Purpose  
Capture—at a single glance—the twelve breakthrough initiatives that distinguish the Fair Preparation Alliance’s Mk1 Mod 3 ecosystem, show how each closes a critical readiness gap, and point every member to the living notes that drive day-to-day execution. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

---

## Guiding Principles  
- **Offline-First by Default**  ▸ each innovation degrades gracefully when the grid fails.  
- **Human-Verified Trust**  ▸ AI supports, but people approve.  
- **Iterate in 30-Day Sprints**  ▸ every initiative owns a rolling roadmap.  
- **Radical Transparency** ▸ progress and metrics surface in the [[Live Audit Feed]].  
- **Interlinked Knowledge** ▸ every directive references its detailed SOP, dictionary term, or playbook.
