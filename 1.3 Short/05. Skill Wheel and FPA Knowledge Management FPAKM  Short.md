## Self-Critique (2025-05-07)

1. Core slices limited to six for clarity; full doc defines optional extras.
    
2. Table 3 uses illustrative thresholds; Training WG must ratify.
    
3. Glossary trimmed to 10 items; may expand for niche terms in full view.
    
4. Need SVG wheel template for print; ASCII placeholder for now.

<!-- Clarification Insert (Top of File) -->
> 🔁 **Offline-First (Clarified)** – Design principle requiring all tools, protocols, and workflows to function with zero internet connectivity. Emphasizes durability during grid-down scenarios. Includes print/PDF fallbacks, radio protocols, and local caching systems.

> 🔁 **AI Firewall (Clarified)** – A rule-based buffer system that intercepts, logs, and holds any AI-generated suggestion flagged as high-risk until cleared by human moderators. Designed to ensure trust, prevent misuse, and maintain ethical AI boundaries across all FPA systems.

> 🔁 **Trust Doctrine (Clarified)** – A multi-layer ethics and enforcement framework ensuring internal accountability, member integrity, and non-violence. Coordinates with AI Firewall and Tribunal protocols. [[See also: Compass Guide, Alignment & Trust Protocols]]
