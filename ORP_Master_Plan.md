Summary of Phased Rank Evolution:

The FPA rank structure will evolve across three core phases and become increasingly adaptive after the third. Ranks are redesigned at milestone membership levels (500, 5,000, and 50,000), with early phases locked for legacy and later phases opening the door to community-fed evolution powered by AI insights.


### Phase 1: Foundation (0–500 Members)

Active Ranks: E1 to E5

Focus: Easy entry, squad building, and baseline readiness.

Legacy Rule: Members keep ranks permanently and earn a visible Legacy Badge.


### Phase 2: Growth (500–5,000 Members)

Active Ranks: E1 to E9 (full enlisted structure)

Focus: Advanced checklists, drills, squad leadership, and community training.

Rising Structure:

E6: RallyCaptain

E7: SignalNode

E8: Trainer

E9: Coordinator

Note: This is the full enlisted structure. Members reaching E-9 now have two options in Phase 3:

Prestige Path: Advance to Officer Track (O1–O10)

Enlisted Master Path: Advance to E-10, a custom-named rank voted on or earned via a major survival contribution (e.g., "GridHammer" or "SignalWarden").


### Phase 3: Expansion (5,000–50,000 Members)

Focus: Grid command, Outernet, regional operations.

Officer Track (O1–O10): For those who prestige from E-9.

Custom Enlisted Rank (E-10): Reserved for those who choose not to go officer.

Legacy + Merit Integration: Early titles stay visible. Officer ranks open new influence, while E-10 becomes a badge of mastery and field respect.


### Phase 4+: Open Governance Era (50,000+ Members)

Governance: AI-assisted + user-fed evolution.

Structure: Future rank system becomes flexible—community feedback, usage patterns, and local needs will inform how ranks function and evolve.

Transparency: Users are informed that AI helps measure engagement and optimize rank/role definitions, but AI influence remains semi-invisible to avoid central control fears.

Autonomy: Communities retain local independence with AI tools helping regions self-tune their ranks.


Plan Safeguards and Features:

Offline options for verification always included (HAM, paper, in-person logs).

“Open Source Governance” ethos after Phase 3, supported by AI but monitored for ethical alignment.

Motivation layers: legacy status, recognition systems, squad tools, and prestige paths.


This is the living spine of FPA’s readiness structure. It scales with the world’s needs—and stays loyal to the mission: build trust, survive together, and evolve with strength.
