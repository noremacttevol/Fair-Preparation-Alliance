# MK1MOD3 – THE COMPASS GUIDE: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs)

Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA)  
**Field Edition: For All Squads, All Conditions**

---

## 🧭 PURPOSE

SOPs exist to anchor us in clarity when chaos hits. They define our expectations, operational integrity, and fallback plans. You join FPA not to spectate—but to act. These pages are how you do it.

---

## 🔵 PERSONAL VIEW (THE WHY BEHIND SOPs)

**What SOPs Solve:**
- Replace vagueness with direct expectations.
- Prove readiness through action: drills, gear, comms.
- Build trust through visible engagement.

**What’s Been Strengthened for MK1MOD3:**
- **Squad Autonomy:** Squad-level decisions > top-down overrides.
- **Inactivity Enforcement:** Decentralized triggers, not admin delays.
- **Dynamic Pricing Logic:** Clarified formulas, ceiling and floor locks.
- **Crisis Flex Layer:** New blackout protocol.
- **Fail-Safe Tags:** Embedded after every major SOP.

**Flagged MK1MOD2 Issues (Now Patched):**
- 🟡 Inactivity timelines lacked enforcement clarity.
- 🟡 Rank resets after merges weren’t defined.
- 🟡 Pricing logic failed to account for fluctuating reactivations.
- 🟡 AI escalation lacked local veto checks.

## 🟠 ENTRY FLOW + MEMBERSHIP SOP

### 🚪 Onboarding

**Flow:**
1. Guest → “Test My Plan”
2. CTA: Join → Application Form
3. Terms like “gear tip” link to [[FPA Dictionary]]

**Form Requirements:**
- Name, ZIP, Gear Tip (25w), Motivation (50w)
- Optional: Skills, Trusted Gear, Readiness Slider

**AI Gatekeeping:**
- 🟢 Green: Auto-approve
- 🟡 Yellow: 48hr manual review
- 🔴 Red: Auto-reject + feedback

**Rapid Review Override:**  
Any **E-4 or higher** in a local squad can override Yellow via peer validation.

🟥 **What if this fails?**  
If AI logic breaks: fallback to “Three Peer Check”—3 squadmates endorse the join manually via secure link.

---

## 💵 DYNAMIC PRICING SOP

### Formula:  
**Phase 1:** $5 flat fee until 20,000 members  
**Phase 2:** `Fee = 100,000 / M`, capped at $100,000/month  
**Phase 3:** If fee < $1, member vote activates Phase-Out → sponsor funding

| Members   | Fee  |
|-----------|------|
| 25,000    | $4   |
| 50,000    | $2   |
| 100,000   | $1   |
| 125,000   | $0.80|
| 200,000   | $0.50|

🔐 Floor Lock: Fee never drops below $0.25 without full-member vote.

🟥 **What if this fails?**  
In case of platform glitch or fee inversion: auto-revert to last known stable config. Backup is synced hourly.

---

## 🪖 RANK PROGRESSION SOP

**Initial Rank:** E-1  
**Rank-Up Actions:**
- Gear Tip Submissions (Reviewed by Squad)
- Drill Participation or Hosting
- Pulse Test Logs
- Squad Endorsements

📌 Ranks are **portable across merges**, unless >50% squad is inactive—then ranks freeze pending audit.

🟥 **What if this fails?**  
If rank logs are lost or corrupted: squad vote + 2 past endorsements can restore rank manually.

---

## ⚠️ INACTIVITY SOP

| Time Offline | Action        |
|--------------|---------------|
| 30 Days      | Ping (auto)   |
| 60 Days      | Flag (visible)|
| 90 Days      | Squad Decision|

🛑 **Squad Autonomy Clause:**  
Squads vote to:
- Keep
- Mentor-Reassign
- Drop

**Merged Squad Rule:**  
On merge: all members retain rank **unless** they were flagged inactive. Inactives drop to E-1 unless overridden by new squad leader.

🟥 **What if this fails?**  
If AI flagging breaks: any squadmate can file a “Manual Inactivity Report” that reboots the process with peer checks.

---

## 📡 COMMS SOP: HAM RADIO

**Standard:**
- Store off and shielded (Faraday cage)
- Tune to 7.200 MHz (Pulse Frequency)
- License not required to listen

**Use Case:**
- Quarterly Pulse Test
- Drills
- Emergencies only

🟥 **What if this fails?**  
If net comms are down: switch to local HAM + designated relay leads by ZIP.

---

## 🚨 RAPID RESPONSE SOP LAYER

📍 **Trigger Conditions:**
- Comms blackout (digital tools offline > 72 hrs)
- Natural disaster or regional chaos
- Leadership unresponsive

### 🛠️ Protocol:
1. Activate “Offline Stack” (preloaded PDF + radio + printed drills)
2. Elevate E-3+ to interim Squad Leads
3. Set fallback meet point (pre-agreed drill site)
4. Resume drills, log paper logs, re-sync post-blackout

### 🧭 Fallback Kit Should Contain:
- Printed [[Compass Guide]]
- USB with SOPs + dictionary
- Battery bank
- Flash HAM radio guide

🟥 **What if this fails?**  
If no fallback kit is available: prioritize secure regroup using public beacons (school, church, or designated node) and rebuild comms offline-first.

---

## 🚫 PROHIBITED ACTIONS

- No planning of attacks or violence
- No unapproved gear promotion
- No political/personal propaganda
- No impersonation of rank or authority

🟥 **What if this fails?**  
If violations occur: squad vote → peer tribunal. Decision logged and reviewed by regional cohort. Bans enforced by consensus, not admin fiat.
