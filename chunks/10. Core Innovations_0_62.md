**(12) AI Oversight + Audit Protocols**
**What it is:** A governance framework and set of tools ensuring that all AI systems used by FPA (like the FPAi Critique Engine from Innovation 5, or any other automated decision support) operate **ethically, transparently, and under human supervision**. This includes an **AI Oversight Committee** (with tech-savvy members and ethicists) that regularly reviews AI outputs, an **audit log** for the AI (every recommendation or critique it makes is logged and available for review), and **protocols for periodic testing** of the AI against scenarios to catch biases or errors. Essentially, it’s the “watchdog” mechanism for our AI – making sure it remains a helpful servant of FPA values and not a black box. The Audit Protocols also dictate how often we retrain or update the AI, how we handle member data privacy in AI, and how we allow members to flag any AI advice they suspect is flawed for human review.
