These mechanisms – clear roles, term limits with decay, dual approvals, and member oversight – work together to keep our governance healthy. They ensure that “trust over control” doesn’t mean naïve anarchy; it means we deliberately **renew trust and prune power** to stay effective. Real-world example: In one FPA chapter, a longtime coordinator became less active due to personal issues; thanks to our role decay rules, his responsibilities automatically scaled back and another member organically stepped up to fill the gap – no drama or awkward confrontation needed. In another case, two finance officers (dual-auth) caught a potential accounting error before it became a problem, each one verifying the other’s work. Our approach is frank: **power is a temporary loan from the group, with interest due in the form of performance.** If you’re not paying attention to the needs of members, you won’t hold the keys for long.
