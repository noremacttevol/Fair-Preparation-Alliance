_The FPA’s Operational Readiness Doctrine is a dynamic system that ties together individual preparedness, squad coordination, and alliance-wide protocols. It defines clear activation phases, role expectations, and fallback procedures so that when a crisis hits, every member (and even our AI tools) knows exactly what to do. Through regular routines and drills, readiness becomes a measurable habit – feeding into trust scores, squad reliability metrics, and leadership decisions – ensuring our alliance stays ready for anything._
