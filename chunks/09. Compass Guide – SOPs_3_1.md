**Who we are _not_:** We are _not_ a militia, a cult, or a doomsday fan club. The FPA does **not** endorse vigilante behavior or any form of unlawful activity. We prepare to defend ourselves _only_ as a last resort and always within the law – our focus is on safety and survival, not seeking conflict. We’re apolitical and inclusive: people of all backgrounds are welcome as long as they uphold our values. You might hear skeptics label any organized prepper group as “extremist,” but we prove them wrong by our actions. FPA works _with_ local communities and authorities, not against them. In short, we’re citizens training to be an asset in disasters, not a threat. The Compass Guide makes it clear that **discipline, ethics, and respect** are just as important as stockpiling supplies.
