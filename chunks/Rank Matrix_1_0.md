**Alliance Points (AP)** are the core metric for measuring member activity and contributions. Members earn AP by participating in or leading approved activities that further preparedness and the Alliance’s goals. To advance in rank, a member must meet or exceed the required AP threshold (AP floor) **and** complete specific milestone tasks for that rank. AP provides flexibility – members can accumulate points through a variety of activities – but **completing the required milestone tasks (“rank gates”) is mandatory** for each rank. In other words, you can’t bypass a critical skill milestone just by grinding points; both elements are needed for promotion.  
**AP-Earning Categories:** The FPA defines **10 categories of activities** through which members can earn Alliance Points. This ensures a well-rounded contribution system and allows members to play to their strengths while still covering all bases over time. The categories include a mix of training, leadership, technical skills, and community involvement:  
1. **Training & Knowledge Assessments:** Points for completing educational modules, passing preparedness quizzes/tests, and obtaining certifications (e.g. first aid, CERT, NIMS, etc.).  
2. **Personal Preparedness Tasks:** Points for developing personal/family emergency plans, assembling survival kits, and maintaining personal readiness (e.g. updating your plan annually).
