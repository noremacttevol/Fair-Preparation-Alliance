Continuous training is a cornerstone of FPA membership. Members regularly participate in skills workshops, emergency drills, and scenario-based exercises to keep preparedness skills sharp. Training spans a range of topics: from first aid and fire safety to radio communication protocols ([[4.16 Brevity Codes & Protocols]]) and navigation. FPA often hosts cross-training sessions where experts in one area train others (e.g., the radio specialist teaching basic radio use to all, or a medic teaching first aid basics). Periodic drills simulate different emergency phases (urban evacuation, long-term grid-down scenarios, etc.) to practice response. These drills not only improve skills but also build teamwork and confidence, ensuring members can act calmly and effectively under stress.
