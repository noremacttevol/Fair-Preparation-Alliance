External Audits or Ombudsperson: To bolster internal checks, we may appoint an independent Ombudsperson or ethics advisor who periodically reviews a sample of conflict cases, including those involving leadership, and reports to the Board or membership on whether they were handled properly. This person could be external to FPA to ensure neutrality. They might also be a channel for employees to confidentially express concerns specifically about leadership that they fear addressing internally. Having this external check can catch issues that internal politics might otherwise shield. It serves as a fail-safe to leadership accountability.
