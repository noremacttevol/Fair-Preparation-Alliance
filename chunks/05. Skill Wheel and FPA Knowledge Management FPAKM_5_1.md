2. **Training Drills and Simulations:** Practical drills (hands-on trainings, workshops, or simulated scenarios) offer evidence of real **skill application**. For example, an FPA chapter might run a weekend field exercise where members practice land navigation or set up emergency communications. Instructors or team leaders overseeing the drill will verify each member’s participation and demonstrated skills. Completion of a drill yields a significant boost to the relevant skill segment – because actually _doing_ something in a realistic setting is more indicative of readiness than just passing a quiz. For instance, attending a “Wilderness Survival Weekend” and successfully performing key tasks might add +10% to the Survivalcraft segment. The system will provide an interface for instructors to log drill results (possibly with notes or scores for participants). Over time, as AI integration grows (Phase3), we may incorporate **digital tracking** for certain drills – for example, using the mobile app to time how quickly a member can assemble a go-bag during a “grab-and-go” exercise, or letting members upload a photo of a successfully built emergency shelter as evidence of skill. Even as we add automation, human verification remains important (per the AI Reliability guidelines), so any automated assessments would be cross-checked by an instructor to avoid giving false credit.
