- **Supply Chain Ethics:** “Fairness in the supply chain” also means we pay attention to how an item is produced and delivered. If we discover, during our vetting, that a product is made with exploitative labor or the company engages in shady practices (like hoarding inventory to spike prices later), that factors into our endorsement. We favor gear from companies that exhibit corporate responsibility – for instance, those that maintain stable pricing, invest in quality control, and ramp up production in crises _without_ extreme surcharges. We’re not oblivious to market forces (we know supply and demand can affect cost), but we expect our endorsed vendors to uphold a higher standard when providing life-saving gear. This is often negotiated in advance: when possible, we’ll ask vendors to **sign an ethics agreement** if they want to work closely with FPA (especially if they seek things like using our badge in promotions or participating in our events). The agreement might include pledges like “no surge pricing beyond X% in disasters” or “prioritize supply to FPA members if shortages” – things that directly benefit our community and keep them safe. While we can’t always enforce such pledges legally, making them public and tying them to endorsement gives us leverage: breaking a promise would mean losing FPA’s trust and endorsement, which is public reputation capital.
