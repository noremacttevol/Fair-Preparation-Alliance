- **Cache of Tools and Parts:** The infrastructure blueprint extends to physical tools. It recommends each squad maintains a toolkit for infrastructure repair: basic carpentry tools, shovels, axes, wires, connectors, duct tape, etc. Essentially a “public works in a box.” If a tree falls and blocks the road, the squad shouldn’t be waiting helplessly – they should have a chainsaw or at least hand saws to clear it. If a radio antenna breaks, they should have spare coax cable and connectors to jury-rig a fix.
