laminated card with life-saving info is not only practical, it’s symbolic – it’s like handing them a _membership card in the prepared community_. People tend to keep such items. And when all else is chaotic, having that little card can be a psychological anchor (“I at least have this guide, I know what to do next.”). No other org has quite this approach of literally **weaponizing knowledge in a physical, bite-sized form** the way we do. It’s proven effective in drills and minor incidents – and it’s a signature of FPA communication.
