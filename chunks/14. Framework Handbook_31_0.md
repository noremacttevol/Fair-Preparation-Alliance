FPA is mindful that not everyone can dedicate large amounts of time or money to training. The ORP is designed to be flexible and supportive:  
- Many trainings are offered for free or at low cost to members (funded through FPA’s membership dues or partnerships with local agencies). Dynamic pricing logic (Chapter 10) is applied here too – those who can pay for an advanced course might do so, subsidizing someone who cannot.  
- Mentorship is a big component. New members (Level 0, so to speak) are usually paired with a “battle buddy” or mentor in their squad who is at least Level 2. This one-on-one help can accelerate learning and provide encouragement.  
- Achieving a level is celebrated, but there’s no shaming for staying at a level if that’s all someone can do. A busy parent or an elderly member might comfortably stay at Level 1 or 2, and that’s fine – they still have a place in the alliance and can contribute according to their ability. The key is that they maintain that baseline rather than regressing.  
The ORP basically provides a **roadmap to resilience**. It gives structure to the idea of “always be improving.” Mk1Mod3 is far more organized in this regard than Mk1Mod2 was. The benefit is already showing: we have more members trained in advanced first aid, more licensed radio operators, more people capable of stepping into leadership, than we did a year or two ago. That translates to greater confidence that when disaster strikes, we won’t run short on know-how.
