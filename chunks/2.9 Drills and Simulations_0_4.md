Over time, the frequency and intensity of drills keeps members sharp. It also builds trust – having “been through” a tough simulation together, members gain confidence in each other’s abilities. By Phase 2, many actions will feel almost like second nature because they were rehearsed. FPA’s philosophy is practice now so we perform well later. Even seemingly small exercises, like a surprise evening “text tree” test to see how fast information cascades, contribute to this readiness. The Alliance treats drills not as occasional chores but as a core part of membership life – often they manage to make them engaging, even fun, while still educational. (Cross-ref: [[Training and Skills Development Program]] ensures members have skills to apply in drills, and [[Psychological Preparedness and Morale]] benefits from the confidence built in simulations.)
