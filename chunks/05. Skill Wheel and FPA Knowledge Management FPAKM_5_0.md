The accuracy and value of the Skill Wheel depend on **multi-source data collection** about each member’s skills. There are three primary input sources that feed into the system, with a fourth supplementary source from plan evaluations:  
1. **Knowledge Quizzes and Exams:** FPA will develop standardized quizzes for each skill domain (for example, a First Aid theory quiz, a Communications protocol quiz, etc.), eventually evolving into an [[Adaptive Quiz System]] that personalizes testing as members advance. These quizzes can be taken through the FPA app or during training sessions. When a member passes a quiz, the system awards a percentage increase in the corresponding skill segment. For instance, passing a “Basic Navigation Theory” test might contribute +5% to the Navigation segment. Quizzes provide an easy, objective measure of knowledge and allow the system to quickly baseline a member’s understanding in a topic. All quiz content will be derived from vetted FPA sources (aligned with the _SHTF Bible_ and official SOPs) to ensure consistency between what is taught and what is tested. In Phase1, quizzes might be on paper or simple web forms with results manually recorded; by Phase2, in-app quizzes will automatically update the Skill Wheel upon completion.
