This concept is analogous to competency “spider charts” or wheels used in other fields (such as career skill assessments or educational competency frameworks) where multiple domains of skill are visualized together. Those frameworks demonstrate that breaking competencies into broad categories and assessing each gives a more balanced view than any single aggregate number ([Domains and Leveled Core Competencies – Joint Task Force for Clinical Trial Competency](https://mrctcenter.org/clinical-trial-competency/framework/domains/)). The FPA Skill Wheel applies the same principle specifically to survival and disaster preparedness. By seeing a multi-dimensional profile rather than a one-dimensional score, members get clearer feedback on where to direct their efforts next.
