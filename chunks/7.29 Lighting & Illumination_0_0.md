Preparedness for darkness involves a range of lighting tools:  
- Headlamps: Almost universally recommended, as they keep hands free. FPA suggests models with both white and red LEDs (red preserves night vision and is less conspicuous). Spare batteries for each or rechargeable ones with a solar charger.  
- Flashlights: High-quality LED flashlights, one primary and one backup per person. Rugged and water-resistant, with extra batteries. Some keep a large Maglite or spotlight in community gear for search operations.  
- Lanterns: LED lanterns for area lighting in camps or indoors during power outages. Lanterns may be collapsible and battery-powered, or even candle lanterns as backup. Crank or solar lanterns remove dependency on batteries.  
- Chem Lights (Glow sticks): Useful for signaling or marking areas (a trail, a cleared room, etc.), and as safe nightlights in shelter (no fire risk). They have multi-year shelf life and each kit has a few 12-hour light sticks.  
- Candles & Lamps: Long-burning candles, tea lights, and oil lamps with fuel are stored, mainly for home use when monitoring is possible. FPA emphasizes fire safety with these â€“ sturdy holders, placed away from flammables.  
- Fire Starting for Light: In primitive scenarios, even a campfire serves as light; so the ability to reliably start one (ferro rods, lighters, etc.) indirectly is part of lighting preps.
