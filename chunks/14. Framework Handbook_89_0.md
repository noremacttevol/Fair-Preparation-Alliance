A centerpiece of the blueprint is resilient communication. **Ham radio** and **mesh networking** form the dual backbone of FPA’s comms strategy:  
- **Ham Radio Network:** Every FPA chapter is encouraged to cultivate a team of licensed amateur radio operators. Ham radio has repeatedly proven its worth in disasters as a communication method when phones and internet are down. FPA’s blueprint lays out a radio communications plan: designated frequencies for local squad coordination (often using VHF/UHF handheld radios) and for longer-range chapter-wide or inter-chapter communication (using HF bands that can reach statewide or further). We have call sign protocols and scheduled check-in times. For instance, each night at 9pm, squads might do a brief radio check-in on the chapter net. This habit builds proficiency and ensures that when an emergency strikes, everyone knows where and when to listen. The blueprint also recommends equipment: e.g., a 50-watt mobile radio with a rooftop antenna for each squad leader’s home to reach distant relays, and portable battery-powered handhelds for each member for short-range intra-squad comms.
