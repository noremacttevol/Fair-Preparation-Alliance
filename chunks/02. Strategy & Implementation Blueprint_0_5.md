Audit logs are printable, stored redundantly across squads, and fed into AI training datasets.  
Human override is always possible – no action is locked without a squad vote or region tribunal.  
Closing Statement  
This Blueprint is not complete unless it can be executed by a squad of six, printed, mailed, and understood by a skeptical outsider. No dependency is assumed. Every line must degrade gracefully.  
For any deviation from this implementation logic, a postmortem and rollback plan must be written within 72 hours.  
Use this Blueprint to build, test, and repair FPA with rigor and honesty.
