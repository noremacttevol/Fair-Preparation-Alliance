Here’s a taste of what comes next (so you can start preparing for it now in small ways):  
- **Phase 2 (Growth) – Training Others:** In Phase 2, with thousands of new members pouring in, one of the biggest needs will be _experienced members to train recruits_. If you’ve mastered your skills and know the FPA way, you might be tapped to run workshops or lead drills for newcomers. Start thinking about what you excel at or enjoy – could you become your squad’s go-to radio instructor? Or maybe you’re passionate about medical skills and could mentor a first aid squad. Phase 2 will likely introduce formal “Trainer” roles (for example, rank E-8 in our plan is a Trainer position for those who specialize in teachingfile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag). Pay attention to how your leaders train you now; it’ll inform how you train others later. Also, Phase 2 means more squads forming – you might be split off to help form a new squad if your current one grows too large, essentially becoming a squad leader. So absorb leadership lessons from your current leaders. The better you handle your Phase-1 checklist, the sooner you’ll be ready to guide others in Phase 2.
