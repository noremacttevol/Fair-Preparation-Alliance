15. **Milestone 15: Establish Regular Squad Meetings**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A community squad initially met sporadically, and interest waned. They switched to a consistent schedule – the first Monday of every month – and attendance solidified. People treated it like any other standing appointment. They kept meetings concise and purposeful: updates, a mini-training (like how to purify water), and social time. This rhythm built camaraderie. Another squad did biweekly check-ins via group text with a monthly in-person meetup. Consistency turned a loose group into a tight team over time.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ Habits form through regularity. **Decentralization** doesn’t mean disorganized; it means self-driven structure. Regular meetings or touchpoints empower members by keeping them informed and involved. It’s also a chance to maintain transparency – discuss any developments, plans, or concerns openly. **Lesson:** Treat the squad like you would a sports team or club – practice and meet routinely, not just when something bad happens. This maintains readiness and cohesion.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Poll members for a feasible meeting frequency and schedule. Monthly is a common cadence that balances engagement with practicality. Lock in a predictable day (e.g., “3rd Thursday 7 PM each month at the library”).
