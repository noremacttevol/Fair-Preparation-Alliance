- **No Exploitation of Emergencies for Profit:** Unfortunately, it’s common to see companies jack up prices or push untested products during crisis spikes (like after a hurricane forecast or during a pandemic). FPA members and any affiliated partners are categorically forbidden from engaging in such exploitative behavior. As an alliance, if we coordinate group buys or distributions during a crisis, it will always be at fair prices (usually pre-negotiated before the crisis if possible) and often at cost. We also won’t play into “limited stock, act now!” fear tactics unless it’s a genuine warning that supplies are low (in which case we’ll say it plainly without extra drama). Our vendor agreements, as mentioned, include clauses against surge pricing. If an endorsed vendor violates that and gouges prices when demand peaks, we will publicly denounce the action and suspend endorsements as needed.
