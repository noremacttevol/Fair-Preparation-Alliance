- **Squad-Verified Messaging:** One challenge in crisis is ensuring that the information we spread is _accurate and not a hoax_. In chaotic situations, rumors spread like wildfire and can be deadly. FPA addresses this with a **squad-verified messaging protocol**. Practically, this means no critical public message goes out without at least two independent verifications from trusted squad members or leaders. For example, if a report comes in that a certain bridge is down, the local squad doesn’t immediately broadcast “Bridge X is down!” until someone from another source (perhaps another volunteer or monitoring official channels) confirms. Squads operate kind of like truth filter cells. They might use a quick code among themselves – e.g., tagging a message with “#Verified by Squad 5 and 7” when two teams confirm it. Only then it’s amplified to the public. Additionally, any message coming from higher up (national FPA or regional command) is signed with a known authentication phrase or code that the squads recognize (almost like a cryptographic checksum, but it could be as simple as a unique phrase of the day or a PGP digital signature if tools allow). This prevents malicious actors from posing as FPA and spreading false instructions. It’s essentially a web-of-trust model: people trust their local squad leads, the squad leads trust the regional leads, and so on, forming a chain. If any link is unsure, they clarify before forwarding. This takes a bit more time than blind
