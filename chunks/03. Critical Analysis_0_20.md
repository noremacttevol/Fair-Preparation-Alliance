Mormon (LDS) Preparedness Ethic: A notable cultural model of preparedness is found in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormon church). For generations, LDS leadership has counseled members to maintain a year’s supply of food and essentials for their families. This is rooted in theology (self-reliance and care for others) and implemented through church infrastructure – e.g. church-run canneries, bulk purchasing programs, and bishop’s storehouses that store food for distribution to those in need. The result is a community where preparedness is normalized and supported; many Mormon households quietly keep extensive food storage, and the church as a whole can rapidly mobilize relief (they often are among the first with aid after disasters, using their stored resources). For FPA, the Mormon model underscores the power of ideological motivation coupled with practical support. Members prepare not out of fear but duty and faith, and they have institutional help to do so. While FPA is secular, it could cultivate a quasi-ideological motivation – e.g. a creed of “providing for your family and community in times of need” that appeals to duty or morality. Additionally, FPA might establish cooperative purchasing or resource-sharing programs, analogous to the LDS storehouses, to help members accumulate supplies affordably and fairly.
