A’s lead and Chapter B’s lead will check in with each other via radio or Realnet and share status. If one chapter needs help and the other can provide, they coordinate resource sharing or mutual aid (e.g., one has extra fuel, the other has extra medicine – they arrange a meet or send couriers). A Regional Coordinator might be a member of the national council or just a senior member chosen to collate info and make broad suggestions, but usually they don’t micro-manage chapters – they facilitate communication and support. National Coordination: For truly widespread events (multi-state disasters or societal collapse), FPA’s national leadership (if reachable) will try to maintain an overview and circulate guidance. They might issue general advisories over the Realnet, like “All chapters: prioritize water purification, widespread reports of contamination” or “Phase 3 is officially declared in X region – Outernet broadcast schedule to begin.” However, given potential comms outages, chapters are empowered to act autonomously if they cannot get timely input from higher levels. FPA’s philosophy is decentralized execution – local leaders shouldn’t wait on orders if doing so would cause harm. Still, when connectivity allows, having a broader coordinating voice helps unify efforts (for example, preventing conflict if two chapters head for the same resource, or organizing a multi-chapter evacuation convoy). Functional Roles: Within each group, certain functional roles are recognized
