Financial Oversight & Auditing: One of Governance & Oversight’s key tasks is making sure our finances are completely transparent and above-board. They manage the live audit feed mentioned earlier, in partnership with Tech’s tools. Every financial transaction the Alliance makes is logged (likely through an accounting system with a public dashboard). Governance monitors this feed for accuracy and any irregularities. They conduct audits – both routine and surprise – to ensure no funds are misused. They produce quarterly financial summaries that any member can read, translating the raw data into plain language (“Last quarter, we spent $20k on gear subsidies, $5k on training events, added $10k to the emergency fund,” etc.). They also handle any necessary tax filings or legal financial reports if we’re registered as a nonprofit or similar. If a member suspects embezzlement or waste, this team investigates immediately. Because the feed is live, often members will spot issues even before an official audit – Governance welcomes that, effectively crowd-sourcing integrity. They know that trust is our currency, and money mismanagement would destroy trust quickly, so they act with total transparency and invite scrutiny.
