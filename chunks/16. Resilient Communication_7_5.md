- **Technical Maintenance:** Operators learn to do basic troubleshooting: changing a blown radio fuse, crimping a broken antenna connector, building a simple antenna from wire (like a dipole or ground plane) if needed ([katrina_hamradio](https://mst.rice.edu/PHYS501/SPR2007Papers/Nkung_kat.pdf#:~:text=its%20own%20radio%20equipment%20and,also%20that%20virtually%20all%20ham)). They should be able to jury-rig a solution if, say, their antenna snaps – maybe using a coat hanger or any conductive wire, as per the famous HAM adage ([Ham radio volunteers help re-establish communications after Katrina – Computerworld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/1690832/ham-radio-volunteers-help-re-establish-communications-after-katrina.html#:~:text=Ham%20radio%20equipment%20can%20be,%E2%80%9D)). This McGyver-like skill is honed by scenario training (e.g., “your antenna is gone, you have 10 minutes to restore comms with what you have in your pack”).  
- **Power Management:** Phase 2 covers efficient use of power in communications. Members learn how to stretch battery life (lower transmit power when possible, use listen-only more than talk, solar charging techniques, etc.). This dovetails with their likely acquisition of portable solar chargers by this stage. They might run a 24-hour field exercise where they must keep their radio and a light running through darkness with only solar/battery – teaching them to ration energy and rotate usage.
