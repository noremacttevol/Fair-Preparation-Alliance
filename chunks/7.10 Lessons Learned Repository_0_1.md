goes – created after learning from mistakes). Over time, patterns in the repository might highlight, say, repeat issues with communication, prompting a focused fix. It’s not only internal events; FPA also documents lessons from outside disasters by studying after-action reports from agencies or stories from other communities, then deciding if similar adjustments are needed in their own plans. By systematically capturing lessons learned, FPA guards against institutional memory loss. Even as leadership or membership changes, the hard-won insights persist in the archive, making the Alliance progressively smarter and better prepared. This repository turns every stumble or challenge faced into an asset for the future, embodying the philosophy that in preparedness, there is no failure if you learn and adapt.
