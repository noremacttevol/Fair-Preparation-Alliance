B. Key Roles and Responsibilities  
To make these structures effective, FPA assigns certain roles and responsibilities related to conflict handling and cultural maintenance:  
Individual Members: Every member of FPA, regardless of role, has the responsibility to uphold the values of honesty, respect, and accountability in daily interactions. Members are expected to address issues directly with those involved when safe and feasible. They should also remain open to feedback – if a peer brings a concern to them, they listen and engage constructively. Members are “first responders” to conflict in the sense that they often see or feel issues emerging before anyone else; thus each individual is encouraged to voice concerns early (either to the colleague in question, to a squad lead, or to a Trust Liaison) rather than bottling them up. In short, every member helps identify conflict and has a part in the resolution process, whether as a participant or a supportive peer.
