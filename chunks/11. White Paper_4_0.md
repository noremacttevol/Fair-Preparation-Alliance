No plan survives first contact with reality – that applies to Phase1 too. We anticipate potential setbacks for individuals and have outlined contingencies:  
- **Financial Hardship:** If a member cannot afford certain supplies or training fees, FPA will facilitate workarounds. For example, we encourage skill swaps and gear sharing. Can’t afford a $100 radio? Maybe another member has a spare to lend or a group buy can reduce cost. We’re also setting up a _Gear Library_ in some regions where members can borrow items (like a satellite phone or NV goggles) rather than buy. Additionally, focus on the _free_ steps first: knowledge costs nothing. If money for food stockpiling is tight, emphasize foraging knowledge, community food pantries, or government distributions which can be stored. **Bottom line:** lack of funds will not be an excuse to throw up hands – we find another way, even if it’s scrappier. A prepared mind can jury-rig solutions (e.g., make a rocket stove from cinder blocks instead of buying a Coleman stove). FPA will also seek sponsorships or grants to cover training for low-income members (for instance, we might partner with Red Cross to waive class fees). Members should communicate needs – we can’t help if we don’t know.
