or packet radio for Realnet nodes), some in gardening/agriculture (for long-term food security, which they share knowledge about), others in mechanical repair or electrical systems (to maintain generators, solar panels, vehicles). These members become go-to resources in crises. FPA has a mentorship system ([[Mentorship and Peer Support]]) where those with advanced skills coach others. Cross-Training: To prevent reliance on one person, critical skills are cross-trained. If only one medic is in the chapter, at least two others will train to intermediate medical level. If one person handles all comms, others are taught to fill in. Cross-training is often done via paired learning (buddy teams learn each other’s specialties). Regular Drills and Exercises: The program isn’t just classroom-style learning; it emphasizes practical drills (see [[Drills and Simulations]]). E.g., a weekend field exercise might require members to navigate to a point, set up camp, treat a simulated injury, and communicate back to base – integrating multiple skills under realistic conditions. After drills, instructors or experienced members provide feedback and additional training on any weak points observed. Use of AI and Modern Tools: The training program may incorporate tools from the [[AI in Member Training and Education]] note – for example, using an AI-based quiz system for members to test their knowledge on medical procedures or using scenario simulations to test decision-making. However, FPA
