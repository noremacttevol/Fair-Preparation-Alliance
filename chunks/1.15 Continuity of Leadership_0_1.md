the person on the spot might need to make immediate calls (following FPA principles and plans) without waiting for orders. The Alliance encourages decentralized execution of its plans: since everyone has access to the knowledge base and SOP, even if cut off from leaders, members know what needs to be done. There is also a protocol that if communications fail, local groups act autonomously to implement the Phase 2 emergency plans and later reconnect when possible ([[Emergency Activation Protocols]] cover triggers for autonomous action). To support continuity, leadership information (like emergency contact methods for leaders and backups) is stored in the secure [[Data Security and Backups]] system – for instance, every chapter might have a sealed envelope or encrypted file with instructions “If you cannot reach any higher command, do X,” which includes the next link in leadership. Drills sometimes simulate loss of leadership: e.g., in an exercise, the chapter lead might deliberately step back to let the deputy run the show, ensuring readiness. Moreover, cross-training is encouraged – multiple people know how to handle communications gear, logistics, etc., so that losing one specialist doesn’t cripple the group ([[Specialized Teams and Task Forces]] always have overlap in skills). This redundancy of leadership and skills ensures resilience. Ultimately, FPA’s goal is that no single point of failure – including a person – can derail the Alliance’s functioning. If one leader
