- _Fair price:_ Costs half the price of comparable filters, making it accessible.  
- **Usage Tips:** 2-3 bullet points on how to get the best performance. _Example:_  
- _Prime filter before first use:_ Fill and let sit 10 minutes to saturate.  
- _Keep from freezing:_ If used in freezing temps, dry out after use to avoid cracking.  
- _Backflush monthly:_ Use included syringe to backflush and extend filter life.  
- **Off-Grid Compatibility:** Note if it requires any external inputs. _Example:_ “No power/batteries required,” or “Uses 2 AA batteries – stock up on rechargeables.”
