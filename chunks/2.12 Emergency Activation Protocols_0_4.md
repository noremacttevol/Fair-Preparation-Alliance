or the situation resolves (e.g., hurricane veered away), leadership will send a stand-down message (e.g., “ALL CLEAR – Resume Phase 1 mode, stay prepared”). If the emergency persists or ushers in a longer collapse, then Phase 2 mode continues and becomes routine operations. Activation is essentially the bridge between normal and emergency operation, after which Phase 2 procedures (like sustained resource sharing, etc.) take full effect (see [[Phase 2: Network Expansion & Communications]]). Overall, these emergency activation protocols are practiced via drills (as in text tree tests or mock alerts from [[Drills and Simulations]]). This ensures that when a real activation happens, members don’t panic – they have a playbook to follow, and muscle memory from simulations. The clear chain-of-command and steps laid out by the protocols save precious time and can mean the difference between an organized evacuation versus a chaotic scramble. (Cross-ref: [[Decision-Making Process]] – in activation, decisions often shift to pre-planned protocols rather than deliberation. Also [[Emergency Frequencies and Channels]] specify which comms to use on activation.)
