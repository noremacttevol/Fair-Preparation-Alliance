– everyone learns new tricks. These gatherings can be at chapter meetings or larger regional meetups. Sometimes they’re themed (Communications Day, Medical Day, etc.). The alliance encourages every member to occasionally step up and share something – even if it’s a small hack or a personal experience story, as these add to collective wisdom. By fostering an environment where knowledge sharing is frequent and fun, FPA ensures that important skills are not siloed; multiple people get to learn them. It also keeps members engaged and constantly learning even in peacetime. In essence, the workshops make sure the knowledge in the vault is translated into action and muscle memory, and that the community stays vibrant and cohesive through the continuous exchange of know-how.
