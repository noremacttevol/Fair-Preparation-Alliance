**Radio Network Protocols:** During an override scenario, squads adhere to strict radio habits:  
- Use **7.200MHz HF** as the primary “pulse” frequency for wide-area updates (national/regional net).  
- Use designated **VHF regional channels** as local fallback (each region has a pre-assigned frequency posted on the squad’s map).  
- Conduct radio check-ins **hourly on the hour** during total communications blackout (more frequently if needed) to relay any urgent information.  
Fallback kits include tools to **verify trust and identity** offline. For example, members carry rank booklets or challenge-phrase lists so they can authenticate each other over radio or in person (to prevent impersonation or confusion in the absence of digital verification). By following the System Override steps, squads ensure continuity of command and communication until normal operations can resume.
