**(11) Trust Graph & Public Reputation Logic**
**What it is:** A sophisticated **Trust Graph** system that maps interpersonal trust and reputation within FPA, coupled with a public-facing reputation score/level for each member based on their contributions and endorsements. The Trust Graph is essentially a network diagram where nodes are members and edges represent trust endorsements (for example, Member A “trusts” Member B in first aid skill, or as a reliable trading partner, etc.). It’s built from peer feedback, mentorship links, successful mission collaborations, and Merit points. On top of this graph, we’ve implemented **Public Reputation Logic**: a set of rules for translating the trust data into a simple representation (like a reputation level or badge visible to others) and for governing how trust info is shared or used (protecting privacy while rewarding good actors). In practice, members can view their own reputation dashboard and others’ public trust badges (for instance, someone might be a “Highly Trusted Medic” or have a 5-star rating in gear trading). It’s somewhat analogous to reputation systems on platforms like StackExchange or the Web-of-Trust in PGP, but tailored to FPA’s activities and values.
