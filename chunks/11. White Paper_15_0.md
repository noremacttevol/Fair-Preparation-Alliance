**Description:** Obtain the necessary funding and resources to expand the Outernet system beyond the pilot region. This involves rallying financial support, whether through grants, donations, partnerships, or internal budgeting, to cover satellite bandwidth costs, receiver hardware for all regions, and ongoing maintenance. By securing funding, FPA ensures the Outernet can scale into a reliable national information backbone rather than a one-off experiment.
**Real-World Example:** In mid-2025, FPA’s leadership pitched the Outernet project to a consortium of tech philanthropists and disaster relief funds. Pointing to the Gulf pilot’s success, they illustrated how satellite data kept volunteers informed when everything else was offline. Impressed, a combination of a Kickstarter campaign and a private foundation grant raised $100,000. This war chest was immediately earmarked for buying Outernet kits for each region and prepaid satellite service for two years.
