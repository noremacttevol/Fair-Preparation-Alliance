**Description:** Create a comprehensive **National Squad Registry** – a secure directory listing all FPA squads across the country, including key contacts, geographic coverage, and special capabilities. This registry will be used by FPA leadership and regional coordinators to quickly identify which squads exist in an area, who to call for what expertise, and to avoid duplication of efforts. It’s essentially an internal map of our human resources and is crucial for scaling coordination beyond the local level.
**Real-World Example:** When a severe ice storm hit multiple counties in Georgia in 2025, the national squad registry was put into action. FPA’s national coordination team looked up the registry and saw three squads in the affected area, including one with a heavy-duty generator and chain saw crew. Within minutes, they contacted the leads of those squads (using radio info from the registry) and linked them up with a nearby squad from an unaffected county for extra manpower. Without the registry, it would’ve been guesswork to find those assets quickly. Local officials were stunned to see volunteers self-organizing across county lines faster than the formal requests flowed through.
