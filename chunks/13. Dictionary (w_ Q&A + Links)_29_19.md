- 3 days without water: The human body will start to shut down after a few days with no water. Dehydration becomes life-threatening around the third day.  
- 3 weeks without food: Most people can survive up to several weeks without food (though weakening), so food is usually the last priority compared to air, shelter, and water.  
This rule helps preppers remember what to address first in an emergency (e.g. ensure airways and bleeding control, then shelter/clothing, then water, then food). [#Beginner] [#Skills]  
Q20: What is situational awareness and why is it important?
A: Situational awareness means actively paying attention to your surroundings and the evolving situation so you aren’t caught off guard. In practice, it’s the art of noticing cues and clues of danger early. For example, a situationally aware person in a public place will identify exits, note any unusual behavior or hazards (like the smell of smoke or a tense altercation), and keep an eye on changes in the environment. It’s about staying alert instead of complacent. In a disaster or emergency, situational awareness helps you make smart decisions (like recognizing when it’s time to evacuate, or spotting a potential threat before it harms you). FPA stresses this mindset because seeing trouble coming even seconds sooner can be the difference between staying safe or becoming a victim. [#Beginner] [#Security]
