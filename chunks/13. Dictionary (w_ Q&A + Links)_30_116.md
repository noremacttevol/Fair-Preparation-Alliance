A: Beyond standard radio, FPA explores advanced comms to ensure robust connectivity. Some members invest in satellite phones or messengers (like Garmin inReach devices), which allow text or calls via satellites when cell towers are down; FPA might budget for at least one sat device per region for leadership to use in a major crisis. They also utilize digital modes on ham radio (like Winlink, which can send emails over radio frequencies, or mesh networks that can create local internet-like networks without infrastructure). Mesh networking with devices like goTenna or dedicated nodes could be tested by FPA tech enthusiasts, enabling a neighborhood to have its own intranet if the internet proper goes out. Another advanced method is HF radio for long range – using ionospheric skip to talk across the country, which they coordinate via agreed frequencies and times, possibly with encryption if licensed or at least in code phrases to maintain privacy. Some FPA communications gurus might even set up portable repeaters (maybe drone or balloon-mounted for temporary range extension) in an emergency. They’ve likely pre-arranged coded messages in case they can only send very short bursts (like Morse code or one-way broadcasts) – e.g., broadcasting “Message 5” might correspond to a longer prewritten instruction known to members. For intelligence gathering, they use shortwave radios to listen to international news if the local comms are blacked out, and scanners to monitor emergency
