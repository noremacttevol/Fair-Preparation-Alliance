A significant concern in deploying a system like this is the temptation for members to chase numbers and badges for their own sake, losing sight of the actual mission (being prepared to help themselves and others in emergencies). We have implemented several design and cultural measures to avoid the trap of **vanity metrics**:  
- **Meaningful Metrics Only:** Every data point in the Skill Wheel is tied to a real skill or accomplishment. We deliberately chose not to award frivolous points. For example, you don’t get 1% just for logging into the app, or a badge for posting on a forum. If it’s on your wheel, it has a real preparedness value. This reduces the risk of members finding loopholes to boost their score without actually improving capability. We will also conduct periodic audits of high scores to ensure they were earned through a diverse set of _relevant_ activities. If someone somehow has a very high score purely from taking easy quizzes, for instance, that will be flagged for review.
