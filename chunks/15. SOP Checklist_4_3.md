The good news: many routine tasks might get easier (the AI might handle scheduling, resource tracking, maybe even generate training scenarios for you). The flip side: human oversight is critical to ensure the AI outputs make sense and align with our ethics. As a Phase-1 vetted member, you may find yourself on an **oversight committee** or advisory board, shaping how those AI tools are used. Phase 3 could also see members being mobilized on a national scale – e.g., if there’s a huge disaster in one region, members from across the country might coordinate to send aid or even physically travel to assist (like volunteer deployments). By then you should be adept at your roles so you can plug into a larger operation seamlessly. We envision a time when an FPA member in California can radio an FPA member in New York for help on something and it’s just like talking to a squadmate. That unity comes from the common framework you’re learning now. Additionally, Phase 3 may involve working closely with government or NGOs in disaster response. Members will have to uphold the highest standards of conduct to represent the Alliance well.
