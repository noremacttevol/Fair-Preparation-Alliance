- **Dual-Authorization (“Two-Key”) Checks:** No critical decision in FPA rests on one person’s shoulders alone. We’ve borrowed the “two-key turn” concept from high-security environments: for actions that could significantly affect the alliance or its resources, **two independent authorized people must sign off**. For instance, accessing alliance emergency funds might require approval from both the Finance Lead and a Council member. Activating a major crisis response might need two coordinators to agree. This dual-auth check is a safeguard against mistakes and misconduct – it’s much harder for one rogue actor (or an honest person having a bad day) to hijack our direction. It forces collaboration at the top: people have to justify and discuss big moves with a peer. It’s also a trust-builder for members: you know no single leader can unilaterally make a risky call in the heat of the moment without a second set of eyes. **Bluntly**: it’s our insurance policy against both tyranny and dumb mistakes.
