- **Celebrating Progress:** When we do make improvements, we acknowledge and celebrate that. Maybe at each annual gathering, we highlight “Top 5 improvements made this year and how they strengthened us.” This recognition reinforces the positive feedback loop for contributors who suggested or implemented changes and shows everyone that the effort of adapting yields tangible benefits.  
The Living System Clause ensures that **FPA remains a dynamic, learning organization**. It prevents stagnation, addresses emerging challenges, and uses the collective wisdom of the membership to continuously refine how we fulfill our mission. By explicitly making this part of our founding doctrine, we commit to never resting on our laurels – the work of resilience and trust-building is ongoing and ever-improving.
