Q11: How much water should I store for emergencies?
A: A common rule of thumb is at least 1 gallon (around 3.8 liters) of water per person, per day. This covers drinking and basic sanitation. At minimum, you should store enough for 3 days (so roughly 3 gallons per person). That’s a bare minimum for short emergencies. Many experts and FPA members actually aim for more – like 2 weeks or even a month of water storage if possible (which would be 14+ gallons per person). Remember to account for pets and extra needs if it’s hot or if people have medical needs. Water is absolutely critical; you can survive a few weeks without food but only a few days without water. So store as much as you reasonably can, rotating it periodically to keep it fresh. [#Beginner] [#Logistics]
