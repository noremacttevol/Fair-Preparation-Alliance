While Outernet and Realnet are different in function – one is one-way broadcast, the other two-way local mesh – FPA views them as complementary pillars of future-proof communication. Outernet is like a lifeline from outside: it brings in information from global sources, such as news, weather updates, or educational content, without needing to transmit out. Realnet is the local glue: it enables members and nearby groups to communicate and coordinate when normal channels fail. Together, they form a loop: Outernet can feed crucial intel into the community (e.g., a storm warning or medicine formula), and Realnet can disseminate that intel among everyone and allow discussion and action on it. In an extended crisis, FPA could get daily data dumps via Outernet – say a batch of files containing updates on the crisis, maps, perhaps even messages from other survivor networks – and then use Realnet to share those files to each household or to discuss strategy in light of the new info. Conversely, if FPA discovers something locally (like identifying a safe evacuation corridor or a new hazard), they could input that into the Realnet where someone with a hybrid node might uplink it (when possible) to a global Outernet broadcast or ham radio bulletin, effectively sharing local knowledge outward. The two systems also provide redundancy: Realnet might carry an internal news bulletin, but Outernet could serve as a backup source if local news is wrong or vice versa. When FPA educates members,
