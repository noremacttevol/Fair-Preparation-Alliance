Even an ambitious grassroots project like FPA will face a variety of challenges. A rigorous examination of internal and external vulnerabilities reveals several potential weak points:  
Strategic Blind Spots: Scope and Coordination. FPA’s strategy might be pulled in conflicting directions. Is it a loose network of local prepper groups, or a centralized organization driving national policy? An unclear scope could dilute its effectiveness. If FPA doesn’t define whether its primary role is advocacy, training, or emergency response, it may stretch itself too thin strategically. Additionally, coordination with official agencies could be lacking – without integration into government disaster plans (like FEMA’s), FPA might operate in a silo, limiting its impact during actual crises.
