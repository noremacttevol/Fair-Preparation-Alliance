- **O-1 to O-3 (Local/Section Leadership):** At O-1 (Team Leader), you might command a small squad or chapter. By O-2 (Unit Leader), you could oversee multiple teams in your area. O-3 (Section Officer) might have you coordinating several units or an entire district operation. Promotions at this level might involve being re-elected or selected to lead at a slightly bigger scale (often still by peer votes of the members in those groups). Your AP will continue to grow through leadership activities (drills led, missions accomplished) and you’ll need to demonstrate success for each step – e.g. a track record of effective team performance to move from O-1 to O-2.  
- **O-4 to O-6 (Regional Leadership):** These ranks represent leadership of broader areas. An O-4 (District Officer) might be responsible for all Alliance teams in a city or county. An O-5 (Regional Officer) could lead an entire state or multi-county region’s membership. By O-6 (Regional Director), you may be supervising multiple region leaders or serving on the Alliance’s executive council. Advancements here typically require a **Board or council approval** in addition to any regional member votes – i.e. the Alliance’s leadership board must sign off that you have the experience and support to take on such a major role. Each promotion likely coincides with either election by a larger body of members (e.g., all members in the region) or appointment by the national leadership after consultation.
