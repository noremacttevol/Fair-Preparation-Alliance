**Linked Systems:** The ORP phases tie into many other FPA frameworks. For instance, the [[Compass Guide]] provides ethical and tactical SOPs that teams follow at each phase, the [[Trust Doctrine]] governs how leadership handoffs occur under strain, the _[[SHTF Bible]]_ offers scenario-specific guidance for Phase3/4 situations, and tools like [[Test My Plan]] help members evaluate their readiness during Passive/Prepared phases. All these components reinforce the ORP, creating a holistic readiness ecosystem.
