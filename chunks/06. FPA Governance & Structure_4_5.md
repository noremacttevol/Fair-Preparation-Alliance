- **Membership Rights & Responsibilities:** Regardless of rank, every member has fundamental rights: to be treated with respect, to have a voice in safety concerns, to access alliance training and support. Alongside that, every member has duties: to uphold our ethics, to contribute honestly, to respect the role structure, and to step up when called upon in crises if they’re able. Higher rank doesn’t mean more rights, just more responsibility. Lower rank doesn’t mean no say – it’s a progression of trust, not a caste system. We expect senior folks to mentor juniors, and juniors to pull their weight. Everyone is accountable to the alliance’s mission and values.
