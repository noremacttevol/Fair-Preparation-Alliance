For context, see: [[Why FPA Mk1Mod2 Public]], [[FPA’s Offline-First Resilience System]], [[Trust Doctrine MK1MOD1]].  
Strategic Objectives  
1. Decentralized Resilience: Ensure every member and squad can operate fully offline and independently for up to 30 days.  
2. Skill over Stuff: Prioritize the training of repeatable, verifiable skills over dependency on gear or passive consumption.  
3. Rank-Based Transparency: Tie all permissions, roles, and access to visible, earned merit (via [[FPA Rank Structure]]).  
4. Live Audit Culture: Real-time financial and operational audit streams must be visible to all active members.  
5. Member-to-Mission Loop: The system must evolve by incorporating structured member feedback, drills, and audit input. (See [[Test My Plan – Questionnaire Technique Plan]] and [[AI Reliability & Human Oversight]].)  
6. No Central Weak Link: Design for graceful degradation, not perfect uptime. Outernet + SHTF Manuals must replace the internet when required.  
Implementation Architecture  
I. Membership Flows  
Defined in [[Operational Readiness Progression (ORP) Master Plan]] and [[FPA App – White Paper]]:  
New users encounter "Test My Plan" simulation.  
Application includes Gear Tip + Motivation filter.  
AI triage gates the application via effort signal.  
If approved, user enters squad onboarding track.  
All onboarding is offline-mirrrored (PDF bundles, radio drills).
