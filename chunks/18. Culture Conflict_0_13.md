Circle Councils and Circle Leads: At the circle level, a Circle Council (which may include the circle’s lead coordinator and representatives from squads) provides governance and oversight. Part of this Council’s role is to handle escalated conflicts from within the circle. The council may form an ad-hoc Circle Mediation Panel for a particular issue – for instance, if a conflict involves multiple squads or a squad lead themselves. The Circle Lead or coordinator ensures that conflicts brought to the council are addressed in a timely manner and that any resolutions are enacted. Circle Councils also identify patterns: if multiple squads report similar issues, the council treats it as a circle-wide concern (perhaps an unclear policy or resource imbalance) and addresses the root cause. In doing so, the circle level prevents local issues from straining the wider Alliance. The Circle Council works closely with the Trust Liaison, and in fact may often defer to the Liaison’s recommendations for resolving a dispute, given their on-the-ground insight.
