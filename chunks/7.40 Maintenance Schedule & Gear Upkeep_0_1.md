- Upgrade and Evaluate: Part of upkeep is deciding if gear should be upgraded. FPA encourages members to report gear failures or shortcomings, so the “approved list” can be revised. For example, if a particular flashlight model has consistently shown a weak switch after a year, they’ll advise switching brands.  
- Caches Maintenance: As mentioned, caches are also on a maintenance schedule – a team will discreetly check a cache location, verify seals are intact, no animals have burrowed in, and contents are up to date.  
- Documentation: Members keep a log (physical or digital) of their gear checks. This ensures nothing is overlooked for too long and also provides a record in case something goes missing or is loaned out.
By instilling a maintenance culture, FPA avoids nasty surprises like dead batteries in a flashlight during a blackout or a rusty stove that won’t light at a campsite. Gear failures in crises can be life-threatening, so prevention is key. The alliance sometimes holds “maintenance parties” where they collectively service gear – making it social and educational. The end result is a cadre of equipment that’s reliable and ready to perform as intended, and members who are intimately familiar with their gear’s condition and operation.
