fancy cloud-based systems might be offline. Therefore, all AI-enhanced processes have a manual fallback. The ethical stance is also about fairness: ensure that AI doesnâ€™t inadvertently marginalize any member (for example, if an AI tool only caters to tech-savvy users, FPA will compensate with training or alternate methods for those less comfortable). By grappling with these issues openly, documenting policies in the knowledge base, and periodically reviewing their tech through an ethics lens, FPA strives to use AI responsibly and equitably, preserving the trust and cohesion of the group above all.
