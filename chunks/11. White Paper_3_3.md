- **Coordinate with FPA comms team:** Register your call sign with FPA’s internal directory (via the app or offline form) so we know who can operate radios. If you don’t want to share your name, just share call sign and general location. This helps in Phase3 when establishing a national communications tree.  
- **Practice emergency scenarios:** Don’t just chat about hobby topics – practice using your radio for specific tasks. For example, on your next solo drill weekend, simulate that phones are down and use your HAM radio to call into a preparedness net or another FPA member to report your status. This builds real confidence under pressure.  
**Phase1.2: Ensure 100% of members complete a Personal Emergency Plan review (“Test My Plan”) by Q4 2024.**
