Step 2: In-Squad Mediation with a Trusted Peer – If direct dialogue does not resolve the conflict (for instance, they cannot agree on a solution or emotions remain high), the next step is to involve a neutral third party within the squad or circle whom both sides trust. This could be the squad lead or another squad member respected for their fairness, or the circle’s Trust Liaison if appropriate. The parties mutually agree on who could mediate. The chosen mediator then facilitates a structured discussion. The mediator’s role is not to judge who is right or impose a solution, but to guide the conversation so each side feels heard and to help brainstorm solutions. They ensure the discussion stays respectful and on-topic. Often, a mediator can rephrase concerns in neutral terms or identify underlying common interests. For example, in the timeline dispute, a mediator might draw out that both colleagues actually want the project to succeed, but one prioritizes thoroughness and the other speed; recognizing this common goal can lead them to adjust the schedule together. The presence of a third person often tempers extreme language and adds accountability – people tend to behave more reasonably when a peer is watching. We stress that the mediator should be someone acceptable to both parties to maintain trust in the process (e.g., each can suggest a name and they pick one they both feel okay with). This is essentially in-circle remediation in practice: using resources within the
