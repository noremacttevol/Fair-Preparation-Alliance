While digital knowledge is powerful, FPA also values old-fashioned physical libraries for their reliability. Each chapter tends to accumulate a collection of survival books, manuals, and printouts that are kept in a safe, dry place (like a chapter leader’s basement or a community center). High-priority items often in these caches include: first aid and medical textbooks, edible plant guides for the region, mechanical repair manuals (for generators, vehicles), reference books on farming and building, and field guides (knots, navigation, etc.). These books are sometimes sourced from used bookstores or donations – it’s an ongoing effort to compile a well-rounded library. FPA also encourages members to print out their personal emergency plans and any extremely crucial references to keep in a binder or notebook in their go-bags; for instance, one might have laminated cards for CPR steps, or a cheat-sheet on radio frequency usage. Chapters may create compiled booklets of their own: e.g., a spiral-bound “FPA Handbook” that contains distilled knowledge from the vault, tailored to their locale (checklists, contact lists, maps, etc., updated yearly). Another practice is maintaining map atlases: large print maps marked with important locations (shelters, choke points, water sources) which are irreplaceable if digital maps become inaccessible. Printing is also used for sharing intel in a low-tech way: a battery-operated printer can produce flyers or small newsletters during extended
