direct style – clear and factual. If your plan has a serious flaw, FPAi will point it out plainly, _but always in a helpful way with a solution attached_. Many members find this honesty refreshing and motivating: _“If my water stock is way too low, I’d rather know now than learn the hard way later,”_ as one member put it. Importantly, **your results are private** – FPAi does _not_ share your plan or score with other members or any database ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=the%20test%20my%20plan%20ai,%20youre%20actively%20testing%20and-cd78d3r0ije/)). It’s your personal improvement tool.
