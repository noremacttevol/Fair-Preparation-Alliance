- **Member Responsibilities:** With the privileges of membership (access to information, ability to influence endorsements, etc.) come responsibilities. Key among these is adhering to this doctrine. Members are expected to: follow the gear testing protocols, respect the ethical rules, contribute to logs and documentation accurately, and report any issues. There’s also a positive responsibility: to help each other and the Alliance succeed. If you have expertise, share it; if you have time, volunteer for a test; if you spot a gear trend or new threat scenario, drop a tip about what gear might be needed. The more active the membership, the stronger our knowledge base. This doctrine thrives on participation. Apathy is an enemy; if only a few do the work, we lose the diversity of input that makes our system robust. So enforcement is not just about catching wrongs, but encouraging rights – through credit rewards, shout-outs in newsletters for great contributions, and so forth.
