7. **Attend your first squad meeting or drill:** Don’t be a stranger. FPA is not an armchair forum – it’s people doing things together. If there’s an in-person meeting, _show up_. If it’s online for now, log in and participate. Introduce yourself, and more importantly **listen** and learn from others. Volunteer for at least one task or role, even if it’s small. For example, offer to help organize the next meet-up, or to bring a needed item for a drill (like “I’ll bring printouts of the evacuation route map”). Early involvement earns trust. Also, completing this step is typically required to move from Probationary status to full Active member. We’ve had folks join on paper but never engage – those people don’t last. By making sure you attend something within your first month, you cement your place in the team and get that much more comfortable working with the group. _FPA expects members to prioritize squad activities._ We all have busy lives, but if you consistently can’t make time for even a monthly meeting, that’s a red flag – address it.
