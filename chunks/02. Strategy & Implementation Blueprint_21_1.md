- **Community Interface:** In dire situations, FPA squads likely won’t just help themselves but also the surrounding community. The SHTF protocols include guidance for interacting with non-FPA persons: e.g., how to share resources or information responsibly without compromising the squad’s safety or violating trust (there’s a balance between helping others and not spreading ourselves too thin or divulging sensitive info). This is part of our real-world grounding – we aren’t a silo, and in a real disaster, trust and leadership with our neighbors matter. So, squads train for that outreach as well.
