- **Trust Firewall for Conflict of Interest:** The trust system also implements a **firewall** to guard against conflicts of interest. If a member has a potential bias (for instance, they work for a gear manufacturer or have sponsorship ties), our system requires them to declare it. Their input on related products might be flagged or set aside, and they may be recused from voting on those items. This is built into our process to ensure that even within our ranks, **truth comes before loyalty**. Transparency logs (see Vendor section) record such declarations. The Trust Doctrine outlines penalties for any member who tries to hide a conflict or manipulate results (loss of cred, suspension, or expulsion in severe cases).  
- **Squad Votes and Collective Decision-Making:** Local squads – small groups of members who often train and operate together – are fundamental units of trust. Each squad builds an internal reputation as well. In endorsement voting (Phase 4 above), we often use **squad-based voting**: each squad discusses the gear internally (we encourage them to replicate tests or at least review the data together), then casts a single vote reflecting their group consensus. This ensures a diverse and deliberative input. Squads with a track record of thorough testing and fair judgment become highly respected voices in the Alliance. This collective approach reduces the chance of individual bias and spreads the decision across different regions and perspectives.
