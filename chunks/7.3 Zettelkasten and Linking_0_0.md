FPA employs the Zettelkasten method (a system of note-taking that emphasizes atomic notes and dense interlinking) to manage its knowledge effectively. Each piece of information – whether it’s a protocol, a tip, or a lesson learned – is kept as a separate note (often numbered for context, as in this Combined Notes file). These notes are then linked to each other via hyperlinked references (like the many [[...]] links in this document) to create a web of knowledge. This structure allows members to quickly traverse related concepts; for example, from a note on “Water Purification Methods” one might jump to notes on “Solar Still Construction”, “Boiling Techniques”, or “Chemical Treatment (Bleach)” via internal links. The Zettelkasten approach means information is context-rich – nothing lives in isolation. When reviewing one topic, members naturally see references to others, which helps them understand the bigger picture and remember where to find details. It’s especially useful for brainstorming or problem-solving: by following links, a member might stumble on a solution they weren’t originally seeking (serendipitous discovery, e.g., reading about ham radio might lead them to a linked note on improvised antennas using stuff in their garage, sparking an idea). FPA also maintains a tag system within this (like tagging notes with #first_aid or #phase2) which provides another layer of organization across categories. Implementing Zettelkasten in a tool like Obsidian ensures that even
