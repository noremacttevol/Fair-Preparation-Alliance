- **Messaging & Narrative Control:** In any large group, having a consistent message is key. Comms & Outreach develops the **key messages and narratives** for the Alliance. For example, they coined “aggressive realism” as a phrase to describe our tone – that likely came from this team after internal discussion. They provide talking points to leaders and members so we all sing from the same sheet. This isn’t about censorship; it’s about unity. If a journalist asks an FPA member, “What are you guys preparing for?” we don’t want a scatter of answers from zombies to aliens to government collapse. Comms establishes a clear narrative: “We prepare for _all hazards_ – natural disasters, infrastructure failures, societal unrest – any crisis where communities need to be self-reliant. We’re here to help, not to fight.” That sort of cohesive answer ensures FPA is seen in the correct light. They’ll also swiftly counter misinformation. If rumors spread (e.g., “FPA is a militia” or “FPA hoards supplies”), Outreach jumps on it by releasing factual statements, correcting the record in local media, or having our well-spoken reps address it directly.
