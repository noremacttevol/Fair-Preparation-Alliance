Participation in drills is mandatory to a degree – members must take part in a minimum number per year to stay active (allowing make-ups for those with genuine conflicts). The reason is simple: unpracticed skills atrophy. FPA is not a paper organization; if you’re in, you’re drilling. The Readiness team documents each drill and logs participation (which feeds into AP and helps identify who might be promotion-ready or who needs remedial training).  
Assessment & Certification: This team certifies members in various competencies. They run a certification program somewhat akin to merit badges or military qualifications. For example, members can earn titles like Certified Medic (FPA-CM Level1, 2...), Certified Comms Operator, Fireteam Leader Cert, etc. Achieving these certifications gets recorded in the member’s profile, contributing to their AP and credibility for certain roles. Certification involves training plus testing – often a written or oral test and a practical demonstration. Readiness & Drills develops these tests and also identifies and trains instructors/examiners within the ranks to expand training capacity. This ensures that as we grow, we have qualified people teaching and evaluating others, not just a bottleneck of a few experts.
