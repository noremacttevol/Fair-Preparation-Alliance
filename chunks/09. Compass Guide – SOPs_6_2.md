- **$5 Membership & Dynamic Fees:** You might wonder why we charge a **$5/month membership fee** (and why it isn’t free). That $5 – the cost of a sandwich – serves a purpose: it keeps our operations funded _without_ relying on big donors or turning us into a commercial enterprise, and it gives each member a bit of skin in the game. Most importantly, the fee is **capped and will drop** as we grow. The FPA has a **fair-share pricing model**: we only ever need $100,000/month to run core operations, so as more people join, the cost per person goes down. At Phase 1 (up to 20k members), it’s $5. In Phase 2 (after 20k members), we switch to dynamic pricing – for example, at 50k members it might be $2 each; at 100k members, $1 each. In Phase 3 (once we’d be below $1), the membership will vote to eliminate fees entirely. We do this to live up to our name – _fair_ preparation – so money is never a barrier to joiningfile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpagfile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. The small fee we ask early on goes straight into tools, training materials, and mutual aid supplies for members. And by having even a token fee, we filter in people who are serious (you’d be surprised how many freeloaders disappear when even a minor payment is involved). It’s a commitment device for you and a sustainability plan for the Alliance. You know exactly where your money goes: keeping the FPA independent and effective, _never bloated_.
