- _Low-Tech Backup for High-Tech:_ While we incorporate tech, every plan has a manual fallback so those without devices or electricity aren’t excluded. If an alert app is used, the same message is also delivered via knocking on doors or posted on the info board. If a sign-up is online, there’s also a paper sign-up at community centers. This redundancy ensures no one is left out due to the digital divide or power outages.  
- _Cost-Sharing and Micro-grants:_ The squad can establish a micro-grant or hardship fund for members: e.g., if a member cannot afford steel-toe boots or a bus fare to attend training, the squad covers it from pooled funds. Similarly, all personal protective equipment that’s essential is provided. We treat basic gear like we treat training – as something the organization should furnish whenever possible. In resource-scarce situations, improvise – for example, making a sturdy emergency stretcher from two poles and a blanket (teaching that skill) rather than needing a fancy one. It’s about using knowledge to substitute for money wherever we can.
