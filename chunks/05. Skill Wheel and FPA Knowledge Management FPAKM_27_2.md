When fully realized, the Skill Wheel will act as a **unifying interface** across FPA’s toolkit – linking the training content of the _SHTF Bible_, the procedural knowledge of SOPs, the experiential learning from drills (and _Test My Plan_ simulations), and the forward-looking analysis of our AI. It essentially closes the loop between _learning_ and _doing_. What a member learns in training gets recorded on the wheel; that record then guides them on what to learn next; and around it goes in a continuous cycle of improvement. This cycle is essential for a “living” preparedness organization like FPA. We can’t afford stagnation; the world is always changing, and we need to be continually learning. The Skill Wheel system institutionalizes that mindset.  
Crucially, we have engineered this system to avoid the common pitfalls of metric-driven programs by keeping the focus on **real-world readiness and humility**. In FPA, a high score on your Skill Wheel is not a badge to show off – it’s a responsibility. It means you are in a position to lead, to teach, to help others with those skills. A low score is not a failure; it’s the _beginning_ of a journey that every one of our seasoned members has gone through. The culture around the Skill Wheel will be one of **support and teamwork**: members will help each other fill their gaps, celebrate genuine skill acquisition, and always remember that no single person can do it all – that’s why we operate as an Alliance.
