for rough terrain, and all with backup manual control in case AI fails. The alliance also ensures these gadgets can be charged off-grid (portable solar panels, bike generators, etc.). By adding drones and robots to their toolkit, FPA multiplies their capabilities: a single member with a drone can search an area in 20 minutes that would take a ground team hours. And a robot mule can deliver goods or map an area too dangerous for people. It’s an innovation born from military and industrial use, repurposed for civilian mutual aid – demonstrating how FPA continuously adopts and adapts emerging tech to serve their mission in practical ways.
