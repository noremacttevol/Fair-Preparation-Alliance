**Lessons Learned:** Setting up a voting system in a decentralized network was tricky. We learned to verify squads via unique codes (distributed in Phase 2) to prevent any impersonation in voting. Also, simplicity is key – we vote sparingly, only on big issues, to avoid voter fatigue. We found that when members had a direct say, they were more committed to outcomes (even if they initially disagreed, the fact that it was a fair vote helped acceptance). The feedback loops taught us unexpected things – e.g., a small squad pointed out that our Outernet content was too techy; that feedback, collected through the new system, led to more plain-language bulletins. We also learned transparency in results is important: publishing how decisions were made and what the vote counts were (without PII) further increased trust in the system.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Develop a reliable database of “voting units.” Likely each squad gets one collective vote on major matters (to keep things manageable and encourage internal discussion), or alternatively each registered member gets a vote – but that could be thousands, which is harder to manage offline. Decide this via the council and by polling membership on preference.
