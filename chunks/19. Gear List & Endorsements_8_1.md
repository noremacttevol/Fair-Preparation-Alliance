- **Printable Field Cards for Endorsed Gear:** For each item that earns the FPA Endorsement Badge, we generate a one-page **Field Card** (Appendix B outlines the template). These cards are designed to be printed on standard paper or index cards and kept in a binder or carried in the field. They contain the essential information: gear name and model, its purpose, key instructions for use, a summary of why it’s endorsed (including any crucial limitations to remember), basic specifications (weight, power source, shelf life, etc.), and any maintenance tips or failure signs to watch for. The Field Card deliberately keeps things brief and practical – something you could read by lamplight in an emergency to refresh yourself on how to use the tool. It also includes references like the date of endorsement and a unique ID that corresponds to the full entry (so if later you regain access to the database, you can look up full details). Members are encouraged to print and maintain an updated collection of Field Cards for all gear they own or might rely on. Some squads laminate these cards or print multiple sets to include in different kits. This way, even if the power is out and internet down, our vetted knowledge is literally in your hands.
