Q34: What is a blackout kit?
A: A blackout kit is a small set of supplies you keep handy for when the power goes out. Think of it as your go-to stash to literally “keep the lights on” during an outage. Typically, a blackout kit will include things like flashlights (with fresh batteries), battery-powered lanterns or LED lamps, spare batteries, and possibly candles and matches as a backup light source. Many people also include a hand-crank or battery radio (to get news when the TV and internet are down) and maybe a power bank to recharge phones. The idea is to store all these items together in an easy-to-find place, so if the lights suddenly cut out, you’re not scrambling in the dark. With a ready blackout kit, you can immediately light up your environment and stay informed until the electricity comes back. [#Beginner] [#Preparedness]
