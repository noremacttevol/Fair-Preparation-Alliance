_Lessons learned:_ Information starvation can be deadly. One lesson from multiple disasters is that rumors and lack of info cause panic. During the 2003 Northeast blackout, people without radios were flying blind with no idea how long it would last or how widespread it was. FPA’s lesson: **every member should never be completely cut off.** We must have redundant communication. We’ve learned to categorize comms into tiers: (1) **Local alerts:** like smoke detectors, local weather radio – immediate life threats; (2) **Outside news:** regional/national info via radio or satellite; (3) **Personal outbound:** ability to call for help or at least send a message to someone. Depending on budget, solutions vary. We learned from members that cheap options exist: a $20 NOAA weather radio can literally save your life with a timely tornado warning. On the high end, some members use satellite communicators (e.g., Garmin InReach) to text when absolutely everything else is down. Not everyone can afford that, so we focus on the basics first. Another key lesson: **EMP protection.** An electromagnetic pulse (from a solar flare or nuke) could fry electronics. It’s rare but possible. We take it seriously because it aligns with worst-case prepping. The lesson: keep at least some gear in a Faraday cage or buy devices with minimal electronics. For example, a simple analog crank radio or old-school CB might survive an EMP better than a modern smartphone. We also ran tests: one member built a DIY
