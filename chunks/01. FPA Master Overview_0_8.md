Membership Growth and Coordination: With AI smoothing out admin and coordination tasks, FPA membership can scale rapidly in Phase2. We formalize a structure to manage tens of thousands of members: squads roll up into platoons, companies, and regional brigades as needed (using those military terms loosely to convey scale). Officer tracks in our rank structure expand to handle larger units â€“ more members step up to command roles. (The AI helps identify members who consistently perform well or have needed expertise, assisting human leadership in promotions and assignments. For example, if one member coordinates supply runs exceptionally and has high peer ratings in the app, the system flags them as a candidate for a logistics officer position.) We maintain the same chain-of-command logic from Phase1, just augmented by tech for awareness and coordination, so no one gets lost in the shuffle even as numbers grow.
