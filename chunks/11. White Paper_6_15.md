7. **Milestone 7: Communication Tree and Alert System**  
- _Real-World Example:_ In a seismic-prone city, one squad set up a “phone tree” call-down system: each person calls two others. They did a late-night test one day and reached 90% of members in under 10 minutes. Separately, a rural squad created a WhatsApp group that pinged everyone simultaneously, but when cell networks went down during a wildfire, that failed. The lesson was reinforced by a drill in another community where relying on cell phones overloaded the system – during an evacuation exercise, so many people tried to use phones that the network crashed ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=Great%20information%20Magdalena%21%20One%20of,all%20those%20great%20community%20leaders)). That community’s solution was training “road ambassadors” with radios as backup ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=Great%20information%20Magdalena%21%20One%20of,all%20those%20great%20community%20leaders)).
