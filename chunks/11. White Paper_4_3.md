- **Decentralization Risks:** In Phase1, decentralization risk is about individuals going off-script or getting bad info from outside sources. Without a centralized command, some members might pick up fringe ideas (say, someone on YouTube convincing them to spend money on a gold-plated water filter instead of actually storing water). To counter this, FPA fosters a culture of **critical thinking and verification**. The _Trust Doctrine_ (see FPA Dictionary) encourages members to verify claims through the group before acting. If an individual is following a harmful path (e.g., neglecting safety by storing fuel improperly due to some internet tip), mentors or other members should intervene with frank advice. Transparency helps here: members often post their plans or preps in our forums – if something’s way off, seasoned folks will call it out (kindly but firmly). Also, to avoid any single point of failure in knowledge, we disseminate information widely: for example, not just one PDF on first aid, but also in-person workshops, videos, etc. If a key leader or expert in Phase1 (say a go-to radio guru) disappears, the info they had is already in our shared materials.
