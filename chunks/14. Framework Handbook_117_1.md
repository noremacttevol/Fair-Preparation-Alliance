- **Psychological Aftercare:** Trust Doctrine doesn’t end with the event. FPA members watch out for signs of trauma or burnout in each other and their neighbors. They organize a small gathering one evening to just unwind together – share stories, console those who lost homes, celebrate the new baby born during the storm (yes, that happened in Squad 3!). The sense of family in the Alliance is stronger than ever.  
- **Replenishing & Preparing for Next Time:** As stores reopen, FPA uses funds (including some new donations from appreciative locals) to replenish caches and maybe invest in a couple more high-priority items (like that satellite phone they wished they had when internet was fully down). They update their gear list and address any shortfalls revealed.  
This scenario showcases **Mk1Mod3 in action**: We see strategic foresight (acting before the storm), cultural resilience (people helping each other selflessly), operational excellence (everyone knew their roles and used the tools effectively), and fairness (resources shared according to need, not grabbed by wealth or force). The cascading crises – hurricane, heat, chemical spill – were met with a coordinated, adaptive response that mitigated harm significantly.
