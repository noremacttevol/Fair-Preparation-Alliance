One key concept we use is the **PACE plan** as discussed: Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency methods for comms ([PACEing a Communications Resilience Plan - Domestic Preparedness](https://www.domesticpreparedness.com/communication-interoperability/paceing-a-communications-resilience-plan#:~:text=,a%20runner)). For a given group of squads or a region, we define these layers clearly _ahead of time_. For example:  
- **Primary:** Use the regional repeater on VHF for all squad check-ins (efficient, wide coverage). Or if the grid is up initially, maybe primary is an online chat group or phone conference.  
- **Alternate:** If the repeater is down (or grid internet/phones fail), switch to a designated simplex frequency (e.g., a common HAM simplex channel or an HF frequency at a scheduled time). This might cover less range, so perhaps multiple nets form (east side, west side of region) and then link via a liaison station.
