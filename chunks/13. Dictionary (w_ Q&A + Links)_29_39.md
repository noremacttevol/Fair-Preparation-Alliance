Q40: Why do I need an emergency fund as part of prepping?
A: Because disasters aren’t always just about physical survival – money matters too. An emergency fund is simply a stash of savings set aside for crises, and it’s a key part of preparedness. If you lose your job, face an unexpected medical bill, or need to evacuate suddenly, having readily available cash can keep you afloat when others are scrambling. In a widespread disaster, ATMs and credit card systems might be down or banks closed, so having some cash on hand (in small bills) can be critical for buying supplies, fuel, or lodging. Also, many problems that people encounter (like a car breakdown or home repair) can be solved if you have funds, preventing a small crisis from snowballing. In short, an emergency fund gives you flexibility and peace of mind – it’s financial first aid that complements all your gear and supplies. [#Beginner] [#Financial]
