**Community Nets and Hubs:** Over time in a prolonged crisis, our squads and small nets might evolve into community-wide networks including non-FPA neighbors or other groups. The doctrine encourages inclusive communication for the greater good, as long as security allows. For example, an FPA squad might run a local “community radio bulletin” at noon each day on an open channel where anyone can listen (to share news, request aid, etc.). This can help maintain civil order and provide comfort (people know someone is out there coordinating). Our members might become de facto emergency operators for the towns they live in. This is acceptable and even desirable – it builds trust and recruits goodwill – as long as FPA critical comms (like our internal plans or movements) are kept to secure channels. Essentially we might have **two layers**: an inner Alliance net (encrypted or coded or just private frequency) for sensitive coordination, and a public net for general info that benefits everyone. Managing these dual nets is a skill senior members will handle, and it should be planned who speaks on public behalf.
