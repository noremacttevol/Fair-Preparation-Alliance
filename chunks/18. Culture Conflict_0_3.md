Honesty and Transparency: We foster a climate of psychological safety so members are comfortable expressing themselves and speaking up about problems without fear of humiliation or blame. Open communication is encouraged – “sunlight” on issues allows us to address them promptly rather than letting resentment grow in shadows. At the same time, honesty must be paired with respect. Critiques are made of issues and behaviors, not personal attacks. By being transparent about conflicts and resolutions (while respecting privacy as appropriate), we strengthen mutual understanding and prevent misinformation.  
Peer Accountability and Equality: Echoing our Compass Guide’s emphasis on equality, every member – regardless of rank or role – is accountable to our shared norms. No one is above the process. Peers are empowered and expected to hold each other to their commitments and to our values. We reject the notion that accountability must be top-down or “authoritarian”; instead, we practice supportive accountability – balancing high standards with high support. This means members address issues directly with one another and provide help to improve, rather than defaulting to punishment or avoidance. It may feel uncomfortable at times to confront a colleague, but it is viewed as an act of respect and integrity to address concerns openly.
