By identifying these risks early, we have incorporated features and policies to mitigate them from the start. We will remain vigilant as the system rolls out. The Skill Wheel system will undergo **continuous improvement not just in features but in safety and ethics**. We plan to establish a review board or committee (including folks from the AI team, training instructors, and member representatives) that meets periodically to review how the system is affecting the membership and to address any new issues that arise. This governance component will ensure we stay true to FPA’s values and mission. Our ultimate aim is for the Skill Wheel and Knowledge Management system to be a strong asset to FPA – something that enhances our preparedness and unity – and never a liability or source of division.
