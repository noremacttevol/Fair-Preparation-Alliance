**Lessons Learned:** Initially, approaching a huge agency like FEMA was intimidating. We learned to start at the state level: after Texas included FPA in a few drills, it paved the way for federal recognition. Another lesson was to articulate clearly that FPA does **not** seek to replace or bypass official response, but rather to fill gaps (an important trust point). By framing FPA as a force multiplier and quoting the FEMA ethos of “whole community response,” we eased political concerns. We also learned the value of paperwork: an MOU doesn’t guarantee smooth sailing, but it gave locals the confidence to call on us without legal fears. Our trustworthiness, once demonstrated, led to things like an FPA seat at FEMA’s National Response Coordination Center during big incidents, which massively improved information flow both ways[fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230907/fema-team-rubicon-sign-agreement-about-preparedness-response-and-recovery#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20increased%20partnership%20and%20collaboration,%E2%80%9D).
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Draft an FPA-FEMA partnership proposal. Include FPA’s mission, structures, capabilities, and how we align with FEMA’s goals (e.g., emphasizing community resilience, plugging into CERT and VOAD as references). Keep tone cooperative, not renegade.
