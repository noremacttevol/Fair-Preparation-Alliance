FPA encourages customizing BOBs for individual needs (kids, pets, medical conditions) but these core categories must be covered. Regular drills include grabbing the Go Bag and simulating a quick departure to see if anything is missing or too heavy. Weight management is crucial – they aim for a balance between packing comprehensive supplies and keeping the bag manageable for potentially long treks on foot. Many chapters have “BOB inspection” days where members open and review each other’s kits to suggest improvements and catch expired items. With a well-prepared bug-out bag, an FPA member can evacuate on short notice and still be self-sufficient and effective (perhaps even help others) for at least 72 hours, which is often the critical window before outside help or further group support is mustered. The BOB is therefore a cornerstone of individual preparedness within the alliance’s overall strategy.
