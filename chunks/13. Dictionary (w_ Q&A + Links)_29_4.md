Q3: Who can join FPA? Are there requirements or restrictions?
A: FPA is open to just about anyone who is serious about responsible prepping. There are no special credentials or experience needed to join – beginners and experts alike are welcome. The alliance accepts any responsible person willing to learn and contribute. Members are expected to uphold FPA’s values (like honesty, cooperation, and fair play) and not engage in illegal or harmful behavior. In practice, if you have a mindset of helping yourself and others prepare (rather than taking advantage of others), you can be part of FPA. It’s an inclusive community: regardless of your background or skill level, you can join as long as you’re committed to ethical, effective emergency preparedness. [#Beginner] [#Governance]  
Q4: How is FPA structured? Is it like a military or hierarchical group?
