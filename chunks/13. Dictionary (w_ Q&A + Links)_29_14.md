Q13: What is self-reliance and why is it important for preparedness?
A: Self-reliance means being able to take care of yourself (and your family) without always depending on outside help. In the context of prepping, it’s the core idea that you can survive emergencies through your own preparations, skills, and ingenuity. A self-reliant person can meet basic needs – like food, water, shelter, and security – when normal services or assistance aren’t available. It involves learning practical skills (from first aid to fixing things), building up supplies, and developing the confidence to handle problems yourself. Importantly, self-reliance isn’t about shunning community or refusing any help; it’s about not being helpless. The more self-reliant you are, the less you panic in a crisis, because you know you have the means to get through it. [#Beginner] [#Philosophy]
