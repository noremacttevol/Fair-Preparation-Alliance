- _Lessons Learned:_ **Empowerment means everyone, not just the usual suspects.** Strive to reflect the makeup of your community: tenants and landlords, various ethnic groups, young and old, disabled and able-bodied. A diverse squad is stronger – different perspectives catch different problems, and language skills or cultural knowledge can be life-saving (like communicating with non-English speakers during a crisis). Also, larger membership creates resilience through numbers – people can rotate duties, and the squad can split tasks. **Lesson:** Always be recruiting in an inclusive way. Avoid becoming a clique. Growth should be steady and intentional; on-boarding new members is an ongoing process in Phase 2.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Set a membership growth target (e.g., “aim to increase by 5 members in the next 6 months”). Use each community event or drill as an opportunity to invite observers or new folks.  
- Make recruitment materials accessible: translate flyers or have translators present at outreach events if multiple languages are common locally. Use simple language (avoid heavy jargon that might intimidate those unfamiliar with FPA or CERT lingo).  
- Create a “buddy system” for onboarding: pair a seasoned member with each newcomer for the first few meetings/drills. This mentor can explain things, encourage the newbie to participate, and integrate them socially. It prevents new folks from feeling lost or unwelcome.
