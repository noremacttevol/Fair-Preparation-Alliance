**Action Steps:**  
- **Study and get licensed:** Use free resources to prepare for the FCC Amateur Radio Technician exam. (For example, HamStudy.org offers free practice tests, and many local radio clubs host free classes.) Book your exam – often $15 or less – and aim to pass within the next 3-6 months. _Low-cost tip:_ ARRL offers free study guides online, and libraries often have license manuals.  
- **Acquire a basic HAM radio:** Start with an inexpensive but functional handheld transceiver (e.g. the Baofeng UV-5R, often <$30). These can hit local repeaters and NOAA weather frequencies. _Note:_ Owning one without a license is legal, but transmitting isn’t – so get that license. Meanwhile, you can listen in.  
- **Join a local net:** After licensing, join a weekly local HAM net (often run by HAM clubs or emergency comm groups). This gets you comfortable with on-air protocol. Many areas have emergency nets you can join at no cost beyond your time. Check into at least one net per week to build skill.  
- **Set aside time for Field Day:** Attend the annual ARRL Field Day or similar exercises in your area. It’s free and open to the public. You’ll get hands-on experience operating in simulated emergency conditions and meet experienced operators. (_Bonus:_ You might make contacts who can help in real emergencies.)
