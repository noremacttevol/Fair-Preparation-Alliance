All of this aligns with the ethos of the [[Trust Doctrine]]. Every member should feel valued and supported regardless of their current level, and trust that the system’s purpose is to help them grow, not to call them out. The AI’s role is as a helper – a virtual advisor that members can turn to for guidance – not as some authority passing judgment. By phasing in these AI features gradually and keeping them transparent, we will encourage even initially skeptical members to see FPAi as a trusted assistant. Over time, as members experience the AI’s usefulness (for example, a tip that proved life-saving, or a training suggestion that significantly helped them), their trust in the technology will grow. We will always position FPAi as a tool under human control – it **augments, but does not replace, human judgment** in preparedness. In summary, the integration of AI into the Skill Wheel system will be done carefully and ethically, always upholding the Alliance’s values of trust, humility, and mutual support.
