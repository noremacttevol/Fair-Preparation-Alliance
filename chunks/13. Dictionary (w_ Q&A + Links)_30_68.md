A: To prepare for a total grid-down scenario (no electricity, communications, or utilities), FPA conducts intensive drills that mimic those conditions. These could be multi-day “blackouts” where members live as if it truly happened. During such simulations, they’ll cut off use of phones, internet, and mains power. Some might go to the extent of camping out or staying in a prepped homestead to isolate from city utilities. FPA then tests everything: will their generators start and run safely? Can they cook meals over fires or camp stoves for days? How do their stored food and water hold up? They practice manual methods for tasks – like using paper maps for navigation, hand tools for repairs, and signal fires or runners for communication if needed. A big focus is communication: reliance on ham radio battery power, perhaps sending messengers between local clusters if radio fails. They also simulate problems within the scenario to push adaptability: maybe a fake accident injures someone to see if the med gear is truly accessible and functional without 911. Or they “discover” a new hazard mid-simulation (“the river water is contaminated now, what do we do for water?”). This forces creative problem-solving under stress. FPA might coordinate a larger regional grid-down exercise where multiple chapters participate simultaneously, to test longer-range communication and mutual aid (e.g., Chapter A radios that they need fuel, can Chapter B arrange to bring some?). After the exercise,
