Communications and other critical tools only work if thereâ€™s power:  
- **Solar and Battery Kits:** The blueprint advises each squad to establish at least a modest renewable power setup. Commonly this is a portable solar panel array with a deep-cycle battery or portable power station. We outline designs from low-budget (a 50W panel and car battery, enough to charge radios and phones) to advanced (roof-mounted panels with an inverter to run larger appliances). The emphasis is on powering communications gear and medical devices first. For example, a squad might prioritize keeping a CPAP machine running for a member who needs it, or refrigeration for insulin. Lighting and comfort come next. The offline-first mentality is to allocate power where it saves lives or enables communication.  
- **Generators and Fuel:** Many members have generators, but fuel can be a single point of failure (gas stations need electricity to pump gas, and fuel supply might be cut). The blueprint covers fuel storage safety (how to store gasoline or propane safely for emergency use) and suggests diversifying generator types if possible (gas, propane, solar, even hand-crank generators for small devices).
