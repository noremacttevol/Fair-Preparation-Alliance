At the core of the Trust Doctrine are several **principles** that every member and system abides by:  
- **Transparency:** FPA operates in the open (internally). Information about decisions, policies, and incidents is accessible to members. We favor sunlight over secrecy. The transparency logs, described earlier, are a direct tool enforcing this principle by recording activities. Transparency builds trust because members are never asked to blindly trust – they can verify.  
- **Accountability:** All members, especially leaders and the AI systems, are accountable for their actions. Mistakes or misdeeds are not swept under the rug. If a squad fails a drill, that’s logged and addressed, not hidden. If a leader makes a bad call, they own it and the Tribunal reviews it. This principle discourages complacency and abuse – knowing that one’s actions will be seen by peers creates a strong incentive to act honorably and competently.  
- **Checks and Balances:** No single individual or subsystem holds unchecked power. We deliberately **split responsibilities** and create oversight functions to monitor each other. For example, squad leaders have authority in the field, but the Tribunal oversees leaders as a whole; the AI can make recommendations, but cannot enforce decisions and is monitored by humans. This lattice of oversight prevents tyranny, corruption, or catastrophic errors from any one source.
