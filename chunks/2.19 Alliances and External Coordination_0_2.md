allow use of its hall as a safe meeting point (perhaps without publicly knowing the full extent of FPA, just that “neighbors need a space”). Pre-negotiating such arrangements (informally) is part of alliance building. Information Exchange: Allies will share intel. If another prepper group has weather instruments and notices something, they’ll tell FPA and vice versa. If CERT has done a neighborhood damage assessment, FPA tries to obtain that info instead of scouting the same area redundantly. This cross-feed of information via allied channels enriches situational awareness for all parties. Maintaining Autonomy: While coordinating, FPA remains independent. They typically avoid formal hierarchy under external command. The alliance is cooperation-based, not subordination. For example, FPA might agree to coordinate traffic control with another group, but FPA’s leader still directs FPA members. This ensures FPA can pull back if something goes against their principles or if their members are needed elsewhere. Conflict Avoidance: In chaotic events, different groups might mistrust each other or conflict over resources. By having pre-existing alliances or at least communication, FPA can negotiate rather than conflict. For example, if two groups arrive at a warehouse for salvage, if their leaders know each other, they might calmly split the contents rather than have a standoff. The alliance network thus acts as a deconfliction mechanism. Scaling Up Response: If an emergency is larger
