Not all communication needs a device; sometimes the most reliable signals are the old-fashioned ones. FPA keeps non-electronic signaling methods in its toolkit for scenarios where stealth or simplicity is needed. This includes visual signals: things like pre-arranged flag colors or marks (e.g., a cloth hung in a window to indicate “I’m okay” or “Need help”), signal mirrors to flash sunlight (effective for long distances on a clear day), and glow sticks or flashlights for coded flashes at night (such as the Morse code for SOS: three short, three long, three short). Audible signals are used too: a good whistle carried by each member can be heard farther than a shout – three blasts of a whistle is a universal distress call in the wilderness. The group might agree on specific patterns of car horn honks or bells for certain messages if living close (like one long, one short horn blast might mean “come outside, I need help”). In rural or wooded areas, they could use a fox whistle or air horn at set times to signal for check-in when radios aren’t working. Markings: If someone must evacuate a location, they might leave a chalk mark or symbol on a visible spot (door, road) to show their direction of travel or status (similar to hobo signs or urban search and rescue markings). FPA trains members in these low-tech signals and even establishes a signal plan: for example, “if we lose all comms and you need to leave the area, mark our meetup board with the time you left and where you’re
