Each squad maintains a **quarterly readiness scorecard** that is visible to regional leadership. This scorecard provides a snapshot of that squad’s overall preparedness:  
|**Metric**|**Goal**|
|---|---|
|TierII Kits Functional|100% (all members have necessary gear)|
|Last 3 Drills Completed|Yes (no mandatory drill missed)|
|SOP Wall Updated|Yes (physical SOP/info board is current)|
|90-Day Radio Check (comms)|Yes (at least one radio contact made in last 90 days)|  
These scores are more than just stats – they directly feed into decision-making:  
- They help **prioritize regional resources** and support. For example, a squad that is lagging in any area might receive extra training sessions or equipment from regional coordinators. High-performing squads might be given priority in new pilot programs, etc.  
- They **influence leadership opportunities.** A consistently high squad readiness score reflects well on that squad’s lead and members, marking them as reliable and potentially eligible for greater responsibilities. (Conversely, chronic low scores might bar a squad leader from promotion until issues are fixed.)  
- They **trigger audits if lagging.** If a squad’s scorecard shows problems (e.g. missing drills, low equipment readiness), the ops council will initiate a squad audit or intervention. This could mean sending a training team to assist, or in serious cases, temporarily rotating in experienced members to help the squad get back on track.
