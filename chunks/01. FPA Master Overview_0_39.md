Gear List Tiers & Preparedness Standards: Remember the Approved Gear List tiers from Phase1? Readiness & Drills maintains and enforces this. They decide what gear is essential and in what priority order. For each tier of the gear list, they provide guidelines and training. For example, Tier1 (Basic Personal Kit) has a checklist that every new member must fulfill within a certain time (say 3 months), including a 72-hour emergency kit, etc. They might host “gear days” where experienced members help newbies assemble or find missing items. Tier2 (Enhanced Survival Gear) includes things like a quality HAM radio, at least one month of food stored, personal defense items (appropriate to local laws and the member’s training). If the Alliance recommends something like a firearm for Tier2 in some regions, this team ensures we provide training on its safe use and maintenance alongside that recommendation. Tier3 (Long-term Sustainability) might involve gardening seeds, solar generators, advanced medical devices, etc. The Alliance doesn’t necessarily buy these for members (though group-buys or discounts might be organized), but Readiness sets the expectation and helps members achieve it. They even inspect or verify gear as part of rank advancement – e.g., to be eligible for E-4, you might need to show you’ve acquired all Tier2 gear and know how to use it. This team also tracks overall preparedness metrics: if only 50% of members have a certain critical item, they flag a vulnerability and
