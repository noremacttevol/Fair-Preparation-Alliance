- Volunteer FPA for roles within VOAD working groups – for example, communications task forces or community preparedness committees. This builds our influence and integrates our ideas (like Outernet usage or grassroots intel sharing) into mainstream plans.  
- Organize at least one major joint exercise per year in each region, involving FPA squads and at least one external partner (be it a state agency drill or a Red Cross simulation). Treat it as a no-fault learning event – the point is to identify friction when multiple groups operate together.  
- During joint drills, have FPA members practice using ICS roles (someone may act as Liaison Officer, another as Operations Section Chief for volunteer teams, etc.) to gain comfort with that system in a low-stakes environment.  
- Incorporate feedback from partners after drills: if, say, an official found it hard to track our squad activities in a simulation, we might create a simple reporting form or delegate one of our folks to be “reporter” at the command post next time.  
- Publicize our VOAD involvement within FPA: it’s a morale boost for volunteers to know their work is recognized alongside big names. Also, it educates them on the broader disaster response ecosystem, so they understand why certain protocols exist.
