Faith and Hope: Many people draw strength from faith or philosophical outlooks. FPA makes space for this: they might organize a short prayer or reflection each day for those interested, or encourage writing in journals about hopes for rebuilding. They keep conversations about future plans alive (“When this is over, we’ll have one heck of a barbecue, right?”). This future orientation fosters hope that current struggles are temporary.  
Caring for Children and Vulnerable: Keeping morale up in children is especially vital (and also lifts adults, seeing kids coping). FPA will create activities for kids – perhaps a game or having them draw pictures – to distract and comfort them. Adults rotate to give parents a break. Similarly, tending to the elderly or injured with compassion boosts group morale, as it reinforces humane values and prevents guilt feelings.  
Avoiding Burnout: The group ensures people get rest. They enforce that everyone, including leaders, sleeps in shifts; exhaustion and sleep deprivation can wreck morale and mental stability. They also watch for signs of burnout or PTSD (like someone withdrawing or getting overly irritable) and will adjust duties or give that person a lighter load for a while if possible. Because the Alliance has depth in personnel, they can afford to be a bit flexible if someone needs a break.
