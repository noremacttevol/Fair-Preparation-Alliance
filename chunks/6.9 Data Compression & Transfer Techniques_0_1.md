an image if digital text is too complex. The Alliance also experiments with sneakernet optimization – for instance, using QR codes or short URLs printed on paper that can encode surprising amounts of data (like a big QR code can hold a few kilobytes), effectively sending data on physical paper which can then be scanned to retrieve the digital info. All these clever methods mean that even if they have to transfer a crucial PDF manual or a coordinate list with very limited connection, they’ve thought of ways to squeeze it through. It showcases FPA’s ethos of resourcefulness: acknowledging that in constrained environments, data is precious and innovation means making every bit count.
