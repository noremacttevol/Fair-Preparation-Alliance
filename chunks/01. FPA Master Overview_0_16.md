Adaptive Reductions (“Vote-to-Zero”): The ultimate goal is that if membership grows enough or we find alternate funding, dues could approach $0. The $100k cap means that as we grow past a certain point, the system keeps lowering individual fees. If we ever consistently collect more than we need (due to other revenue streams or very large membership), leadership can propose a vote to members: “Shall we reduce membership fees further, or even abolish them?” If a majority agrees, dues could be lowered below the cap or eliminated entirely. We call this the “vote-to-zero” option – the membership can literally vote to zero-out the fee when we’re ready. Even if fees went to $0, membership would still carry an expectation of contributing in other ways (time, effort, expertise), so being “free” wouldn’t invite freeloaders. And if new expenses arose in the future, members could vote to reinstate a modest fee. It’s democracy and fairness in action: those who pay are those who benefit, and they collectively decide the terms.
