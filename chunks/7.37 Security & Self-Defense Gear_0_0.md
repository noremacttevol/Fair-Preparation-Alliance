FPAâ€™s stance on security is to be prepared for the possibility of threats (looters, wildlife, etc.) while prioritizing de-escalation and safety. Gear in this category may vary widely due to personal choice and legalities, but commonly includes:  
- Locks & Barriers: Additional padlocks, chains, and door reinforcement bars to secure property. Some members carry portable door locks or wedges when sheltering in an unknown location (to prevent entry).  
- Non-lethal tools: Pepper spray is widely carried for personal defense (against humans or aggressive dogs). Some have tasers or stun batons if legal. High-powered tactical flashlights can disorient threats at night.  
- Defensive Firearms: Many chapters include members who are trained and licensed to carry firearms. The Alliance neither mandates nor forbids guns; it stresses training, safe handling, and secure storage if one chooses this route. Those who do often coordinate on common calibers and types (e.g., a 9mm pistol for personal defense, a shotgun or rifle at home). Along with firearms come necessary accessories: cleaning kits, plenty of ammunition in waterproof storage, holsters, and safes. Importantly, FPA holds range days to maintain proficiency and has clear rules of engagement focusing on defense of life.
