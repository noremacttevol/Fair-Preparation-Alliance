**Description:** Execute a full-scale national communication drill simulating a total grid-down scenario (no cell service, no internet) to test the newly established HAM relay network and Outernet pilot. This drill will engage every region simultaneously, requiring relay squads to pass messages across the country and local squads to operate independently yet stay in the information loop. The goal is to identify weak links, latency issues, or training gaps under realistic conditions and then refine procedures.
**Real-World Example:** In mid-2025, FPA ran a 48-hour “Blackout Blitz” exercise: a fictional cyber-attack knocked out power nationwide. Squads from Maine to California had to coordinate rescue and supply efforts using only HAM radios and the Outernet feed. During the drill, a message originating in New York (“water filters needed in Bronx”) successfully hopped through four regional relays to reach California within hours, and a reply with resource offers came back the same way. This proved the coast-to-coast relay concept, albeit with some hiccups.
