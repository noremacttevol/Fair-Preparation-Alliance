Messaging & Narrative Control: In any large group, a consistent message is key. Comms & Outreach develops the key messages and narratives for the Alliance. For example, the phrase “aggressive realism” to describe our tone was likely coined by this team after internal discussion. They provide talking points to leaders and members so that we’re all singing from the same sheet music when explaining FPA. This isn’t about censorship; it’s about unity of message. If a journalist asks a member “What are you guys preparing for?” we don’t want wildly different answers (zombies vs. aliens vs. government collapse). Comms ensures we have a clear, honest narrative: e.g., “We prepare for all hazards – natural disasters, infrastructure failures, societal unrest – any crisis where communities need to be self-reliant. We’re here to help, not to fight.” That kind of cohesive answer helps FPA be seen in the correct light. They also swiftly counter misinformation. If rumors spread (“FPA is a militia” or “FPA hoards supplies”), Outreach jumps on it by releasing facts, correcting the record in local media, or having our well-spoken reps address it directly.
