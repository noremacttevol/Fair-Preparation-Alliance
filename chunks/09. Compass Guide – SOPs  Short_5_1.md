> 🔁 **Offline-First (Clarified)** – Design principle requiring all tools, protocols, and workflows to function with zero internet connectivity. Emphasizes durability during grid-down scenarios. Includes print/PDF fallbacks, radio protocols, and local caching systems.

> 🔁 **AI Firewall (Clarified)** – A rule-based buffer system that intercepts, logs, and holds any AI-generated suggestion flagged as high-risk until cleared by human moderators. Designed to ensure trust, prevent misuse, and maintain ethical AI boundaries across all FPA systems.

> 🔁 **Trust Doctrine (Clarified)** – A multi-layer ethics and enforcement framework ensuring internal accountability, member integrity, and non-violence. Coordinates with AI Firewall and Tribunal protocols. [[See also: Compass Guide, Alignment & Trust Protocols]]
