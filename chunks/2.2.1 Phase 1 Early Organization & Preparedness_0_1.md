Resource Gathering: Members individually and sometimes cooperatively stockpile needed supplies according to the [[Approved Gear List Overview]]. During Phase 1, the emphasis is on each member achieving a baseline of preparedness (water, food, medical supplies for their household for a certain duration, personal defense tools, etc.). FPA facilitates this by providing the gear list, discount opportunities (if the alliance arranges group buys), and guidance on efficient prepping on various budgets.  
Community Building: Trust and cohesion are built through regular meet-ups and activities ([[Member Meetings and Events]]). Chapters often hold monthly meetings, group hikes, field exercises, or just social gatherings (barbecues, etc.) – these serve to bond members and identify strengths/weaknesses in the group. By Phase 2, members should know each other well and function as a team; Phase 1 is when that familiarity is established.  
Communications Setup: In Phase 1, FPA uses common platforms (encrypted messaging apps, email lists, maybe a private forum). However, they also prepare the infrastructure for Phase 2’s Realnet and practice using alternative comms in case mainstream systems fail. For instance, members obtain ham radio licenses and start holding practice nets on weekends ([[Ham Radio Network]] usage begins as a hobby/training activity in Phase 1).
