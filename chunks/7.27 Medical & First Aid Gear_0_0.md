Medical emergencies must be anticipated with proper gear:  
- First Aid Kits: Each member has a personal kit, and chapters maintain advanced kits. These include bandages, gauze, antiseptic, tweezers, pain relievers, gloves, and a CPR face shield. FPA-approved kits might mirror Red Cross recommendations for quantity but often enhanced with trauma supplies.  
- Trauma Supplies: Tourniquets (CAT or SOFTT-W), pressure dressings, hemostatic agents (like QuikClot gauze) for severe bleeding. SAM splints and triangular bandages for fractures/sprains. Chest seals for puncture wounds if in high-risk areas.  
- Medications: A supply of over-the-counter meds (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, antihistamines, anti-diarrheals, electrolytes) and any necessary prescription meds rotated regularly. Some members also acquire fish antibiotics as a last resort for bacterial infections (not officially endorsed, but known in prepper circles).  
- Instruments: Basic diagnostic and treatment tools: a stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, thermometer (non-digital backup like analog or forehead strips), shears, scalpel blades, suture kit or wound closure strips, irrigation syringe for cleaning wounds, and oral airways. Those with medical training may add more (IV kits, etc.).  
- Protective Gear: Nitrile gloves in quantity, N95 masks, eye protection, and apron or gown for infection control. Also red biohazard bags for waste.
