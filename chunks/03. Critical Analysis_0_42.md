Potential for Rapid Scaling via Networks: Because FPA is an alliance, it can grow through network effects. One strong local chapter can inspire neighboring towns to start their own. Given today’s connectivity, an idea trialed in one city (say, a neighborhood barter system for supplies) can be documented by FPA and shared widely for others to adopt. The alliance structure means successes are shared, not siloed. As more communities join, the value of the network increases (each node adds capacity and knowledge), which follows the principle of network effects seen in technology platforms. If FPA can demonstrate clear benefits for communities, it might enjoy a rapid “viral” growth in membership at some tipping point. This is an advantage over heavily centralized programs that grow only via official channels – FPA can propagate organically through social proof.
