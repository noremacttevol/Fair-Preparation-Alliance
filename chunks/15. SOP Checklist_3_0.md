**Alliance Points (AP)** are the lifeblood of FPA’s member recognition system. Think of AP like experience points in a game – you earn them for every constructive action you take, and as you accumulate them, you level up (advance in rank). Why do we use AP? To instill a culture of _action and merit_. In the FPA, rank isn’t given based on who you know or how long you’ve been around; it’s earned by doing what helps the alliance.  
Here’s how it works in practice: Each checklist item above, and many other activities, have AP values assigned. For example, when you completed the “Day Zero Basics” training, that might automatically award, say, 10 AP. Attending a squad drill could be 5 AP. Getting your First Aid certification might give 20 AP, and so on. Your squad leader or the app (if you log it) updates your AP tally. Accumulate a certain amount, and provided you’ve met any skill prerequisites, you get promoted to the next rank (E-2, E-3, etc.). Early ranks are easy to achieve – an active new member can reach **E-2** within a couple of months. Higher ranks naturally require more points and demonstration of leadership skills (for instance, to make E-4 you might need to have mentored a newer member in addition to points).
