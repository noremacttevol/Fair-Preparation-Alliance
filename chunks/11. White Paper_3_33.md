- **Connect to broader community:** Mentors should introduce mentees to the wider FPA community channels – invite them to local meetups, get them on the forum or radio nets, etc. The earlier a new member feels part of the tribe, the more likely they are to stay engaged. If you’re geographically close, an in-person meet (even if just a coffee chat about prepping) can solidify the bond. If distant, consider group video chats with a few mentor pairs to share experiences.  
- **Escalate if issues arise:** If a pairing isn’t working out (communication issues, personality clash, or mentor/mentee becomes unresponsive), don’t let it just fizzle. Contact the regional coordinator or post on the app’s mentor forum to get help. We can re-pair people; there’s no stigma. The end goal is everyone ends up with a compatible partner. Also, mentors should not become overbearing or authoritarian – if you sense that, speak up. We mentor to empower, not to control. Transparency is key: no hazing, no elitism.  
- **Grow into Phase2 teams:** Start identifying who among your contacts (mentors, mentees, maybe a couple of other solo preppers you know) could form a local squad. Mentors can help introduce mentees to others nearby as FPA membership grows. The buddy system in Phase1 is a stepping stone to the squad system in Phase2. Keep an eye out for people in your area with complementary skills – those will be natural allies later.
