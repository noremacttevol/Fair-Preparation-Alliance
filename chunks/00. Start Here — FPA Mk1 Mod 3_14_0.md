_Reference systems, training materials, and resilient infrastructure for information._  
- [[7.1 - FPA Dictionary System Overview]] – Explanation of FPA’s internal lexicon and terminology system. Ensures everyone uses consistent definitions for key terms, acronyms, and concepts. (This “dictionary” is a quick reference for all unique FPA jargon and operational terms.)  
- [[7.2 - FPA Q&A Knowledge Base]] – Central repository of questions and answers for common scenarios and challenges. Collects hard-earned lessons and FAQs from members, so that proven solutions and guidance are easily searchable. (A living knowledge base capturing the Alliance’s collective wisdom.)  
- [[7.3 - Offline-First Resilience System]] – Design of FPA’s information and communication systems to work with little or no internet connectivity. Details how data, comms, and coordination tools are made resilient (through local servers, mesh networks, radio, etc.), ensuring continuity in **grid-down** or remote situations.  
- [[7.4 - “SHTF Bible” & Skills Training System]] – Concept for a comprehensive survival manual (the **“SHTF Bible”**) coupled with a structured skills training program for members. Describes the content and usage of the SHTF Bible (a vault of survival knowledge and checklists) and how it integrates with hands-on training modules to build member competencies over time.
