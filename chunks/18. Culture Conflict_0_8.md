Circles: A circle is a larger organizational grouping that contains multiple squads or functions (analogous to a department or chapter). Circles in FPA provide coordination, shared resources, and governance for their member squads. They also serve as the next level of conflict resolution if a squad-level issue cannot be resolved internally. Each circle has a Circle Council (composed of squad leads or elected representatives) and typically designates a Trust Liaison (defined below) who focuses on maintaining trust and handling conflicts that rise to the circle level. Circles ensure that if a conflict spans multiple squads or if a squad cannot resolve an issue alone, there is a clear path to escalate the matter constructively. For instance, if two squads have a conflict (say, competing for resources or having overlapping responsibilities causing tension), their circle can convene a discussion or mediation at the circle level to resolve the dispute.
