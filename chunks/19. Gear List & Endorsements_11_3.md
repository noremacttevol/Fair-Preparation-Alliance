- **Periodic Review:** The Alliance will conduct a formal review of this doctrine at set intervals (for example, every two years, or sooner if a major event or lesson prompts it). A review committee will gather any feedback, track how well the policies have held up (did we encounter situations the doctrine didnâ€™t cover? Are there sections that proved impractical?), and propose amendments as needed. This ensures the doctrine remains a living document, improving with time and experience. After a major crisis (where we truly test our systems), an immediate review is often done to capture lessons learned.
