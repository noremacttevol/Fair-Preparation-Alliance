Maintains unity of purpose and fellowship, such that even when we debate passionately, we do so as one community seeking the best for all.  
We recognize that no framework can guarantee perfection. What it guarantees is a path to follow when storms arise. The true strength of FPA will be proven when conflicts occur and we navigate them successfully, when leaders falter and we responsibly renew our leadership, and when external adversity strikes and our culture holds firm. With this living document, we have charted that path clearly.  
Let this framework be reviewed, taught, and upheld with the seriousness of a constitution. Let every member, from newest recruit to veteran founder, take ownership of it. In the daily details of conflicts mediated and feedback given, its spirit comes alive. And let it be a beacon to other organizations as well â€“ demonstrating that with the right commitment, conflict can build instead of break, and a diverse alliance can remain united across time.  
In signing onto this Conflict Handling & Cultural Resilience Framework, the Fair Preparation Alliance declares that it will forever place integrity and learning at the heart of its collective life. Through honesty, accountability, and solidarity, we will meet the future unafraid, knowing that *no matter what challenges arise within or without, we have the tools and the will to emerge stronger together.*
