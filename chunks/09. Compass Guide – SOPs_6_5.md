- **Partial AI, Not AI Dependence:** We embrace technology – including artificial intelligence – but **with caution and purpose**. The FPA has an AI assistant (“FPAi”) and planning tools (like **Test My Plan**) that are incredibly useful for training and scenario simulation. However, we deliberately call Phase 2 “partial AI” because we augment human decision-making with AI, we don’t replace it. Why? Because technology can fail or misguide if unrestrained. Our approach is: use AI in planning and analysis _before_ a crisis (to crunch data, suggest improvements, personalize training), but when the grid is down or lives are on the line, we fall back on human leadership and pre-printed, verified plans. You’ll see this reflected in our protocols – e.g., our AI might evaluate your emergency plan and point out weaknesses (so you can fix them now), but come “Day Zero” (disaster day), you’ll be executing a plan you understand fully, not asking an AI what to do. We also keep AI’s role transparent. In Phase 3 (“full AI integration”), we intend for AI to help even more with coordination as our membership scales into the tens of thousands – _yet even then_, it remains a tool under human oversight. The FPA’s stance is that **human judgment, especially guided by ethics and real experience, remains supreme**. We use AI to get better, never to get lazy. (Plus, all critical AI-derived info is available offline in print, because if the AI or internet is unreachable, we don’t get caught
