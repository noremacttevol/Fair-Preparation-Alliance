- **Compass Guide (Ethical & Decision-Making Framework):** The _Compass Guide_ is essentially the FPA’s playbook and moral compass rolled into one. It’s a living document (and training program) that translates our high-level values into on-the-ground protocols.

The Compass Guide ensures that whether a squad is operating in a wildfire in California or a flood in Florida, they share a common approach and ethics. It’s written in plain language and updated with lessons learned after real events and drills. When in doubt, members can refer to the Compass to see what our principles suggest. It’s also a tool for accountability: if someone’s actions are questioned, we compare them against the Compass Guide. _For instance, if a team lead decided to abandon a certain neighborhood during a response, was that consistent with our guide’s prioritization of helping the most vulnerable first?_ If not, we have a basis to review that choice. In essence, the Compass Guide keeps us all pointed in the same direction, ethically and tactically.
