While FPA primarily focuses on its members, it does not exist in isolation and thus has a policy for external relationships. External partnerships refer to alliances or cooperative arrangements with other groups, organizations, or community entities that align with FPA’s mission. This could include local community emergency response teams (CERT), ham radio clubs, farming co-ops, or even other prepping networks. FPA’s approach is to cautiously engage with such partners for mutual benefit while protecting its own operational security. For example, a local FPA chapter might partner with a neighborhood watch or church group for disaster drills or share non-sensitive resources like public training sessions (e.g., offering a first-aid class to the broader community). The policy dictates that any formal partnership or sharing of FPA resources outside the group must be approved by leadership and openly communicated to members, so everyone understands what is being shared and why (transparency is key to maintain internal trust).
