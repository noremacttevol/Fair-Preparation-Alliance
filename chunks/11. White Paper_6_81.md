27. **Milestone 27: Mentorship Program for New Squads**  
- _Real-World Example:_ After establishing a solid squad in their own neighborhood, members of that team helped the adjacent neighborhood start their own. They didn’t take over; instead, they shared their Phase 2 plan, attended the first few meetings of the new group to offer guidance, and even lent some equipment for initial drills. This mentorship shortened the learning curve for the new squad, which achieved in 4 months what took the first squad a year. Over time, these two squads and others they mentored formed a mini-network, occasionally training together and definitely supporting each other in major events. This “each one teach one” approach greatly scaled FPA’s reach in that city without needing top-down management.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ **Decentralization doesn’t mean isolation; it means replication.** A mature squad is one of the best resources for spawning new squads because they have local credibility and experience. Mentoring also benefits the mentor squad – teaching reinforces their own knowledge and spreads the workload of community preparedness across more people. **Lesson:** Bake into Phase 2 the expectation that squads will pay it forward by mentoring others. This builds the mentorship network organically and prepares for Phase 3’s larger coordination. However, mentors should be careful to empower the new group’s leadership, not dominate it – guidance, not control.
