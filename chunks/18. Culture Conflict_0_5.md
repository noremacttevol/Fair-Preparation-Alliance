Timeliness and Proactivity: Address issues early, before they escalate. A minor disagreement addressed today is far easier to resolve than a crisis ignored until tomorrow. Thus, a culture of early intervention pervades FPA – small tensions should be brought to the surface and resolved through informal chats or team meetings, rather than suppressed. Leaders and members alike have a duty to notice signs of conflict or morale problems and initiate dialogue promptly. We will use tools like regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and surveys to detect brewing issues. This proactive stance prevents avoidable breakdowns and keeps our collective focus on the mission.  
Endurance and Adaptability: This framework is intended to last a century, meaning it must be both stable and adaptable. The core principles will remain firm, but the specific practices can evolve through the proper governance channels if we discover better methods. In this way, the framework itself is resilient – able to be amended (with broad consensus) as the Alliance grows, while always staying true to the fundamental values stated here. The intent is that no matter how times change, FPA will always have robust means to handle internal challenges and emerge stronger.
