To keep lines of communication open, FPA prioritizes equipping members with the right comms devices (tying into category 4 details but focusing on gear):  
- Handheld Radios: Most members have a handheld FRS/GMRS radio for local comms (easy to use, no license for FRS). Many also invest in dual-band ham handhelds which can hit repeaters or do simplex over longer range (with the understanding they’ll get licensed or at least use in emergency). Standardizing models (as per [[7.17 Standardization of Gear]]) allows battery and accessory sharing.  
- Mobile/Base Radios: At home or in vehicles, more powerful mobile radios (25-50W) are installed by some, with antennas on the roof, to serve as chapter net control stations or reach distant members. These usually cover HAM bands (VHF/UHF) and possibly CB.  
- CB Radios: Truck and car units for CB are in the vehicle kit for many, plus a portable CB for base camp – useful in caravans and to communicate with outsiders like truckers during highway evacuations.  
- Satellite Phones/Messengers: Though expensive, a few devices are shared as group gear. A sat phone can be rotated among leaders to check in with out-of-area contacts when cell networks fail. Satellite text messengers (Garmin InReach, etc.) are more common since they are cheaper – at least one per chapter to send/receive 160-char messages via satellite.
