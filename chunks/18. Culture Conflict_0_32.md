Step 1: Direct Dialogue Between Parties – When a conflict arises between two or more squad members, the first step is a private, face-to-face dialogue among those directly involved. One party (preferably the one who feels aggrieved, or alternatively a team lead facilitating) says, “Can we talk about what happened?” They then discuss the issue openly, each person explaining their perspective and feelings while the other listens. The aim is to clarify any misunderstandings and see if a mutually agreeable solution or at least a better understanding can be reached informally. Both parties should approach this conversation in good faith, remembering our shared values and assuming the other is willing to find a resolution. Many conflicts are due to miscommunication and can be cleared up by sincere discussion. According to research on self-managed teams, simply sitting down together as adults to sort out an issue is the essential first phase. We empower our members to have these conversations without needing a “boss” to mediate. Example: Two colleagues have differing approaches to a task timeline and each feels the other is not listening. In Step 1, they meet and each describes their concerns (“I felt frustrated when my suggestions were overlooked,” “I didn’t realize that, I was focused on hitting the deadline I promised.”). Through this, they might find a compromise or at least clear the air.
