- High-Vis and Hard Hats: For working near roads or in collapsed-building scenarios, a high-visibility vest and a hard hat are part of community gear. CERT vests and helmets often double for this purpose among FPA volunteers aiding public response.  
- Thermal Regulation: Items like a shemagh or bandana (multi-use for sun, dust, warmth), warming layers (fleece, wool base layers), and cooling scarves for heat waves.
The Alliance motto for clothing is “Cotton kills” – favor wool or synthetics that insulate when wet. They have each member test their gear in adverse conditions (a rainy hike, a cold night out) to trust its performance. By having the right clothing and PPE, FPA members enhance their resilience against the elements and physical hazards, staying protected, dry, and visible as needed in any operation.
