**(5) FPAi “Test‑My‑Plan” & Critique Engine**
**What it is:** _FPAi_ is our **AI-powered preparedness planning assistant**, and the “Test-My-Plan” feature is its flagship capability. Members can input their personal emergency plan – or even just their scenario ideas – and this AI engine will **simulate and critique the plan**, highlighting strengths, gaps, and suggestions for improvement. It’s like having a seasoned prepper coach and a disaster **red-team** reviewing your plan 24/7. The engine runs your plan through multiple scenario models (natural disasters, grid-down, medical emergencies, etc.) and provides a detailed report: what supplies might be insufficient, which skills you’re missing, how your evacuation route stands up to different hazards, and so on. It also cross-references against our knowledge base to suggest SOPs or solutions for identified weaknesses.
