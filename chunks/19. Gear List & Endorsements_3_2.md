3. **AI Synthesis & Review:** After several members or squads have reported their test results, the Alliance compiles the data. We leverage an internal AI-driven system to aggregate all member feedback, lab data, and relevant external research into a clear report. This **synthesis** summarizes the gear’s actual performance versus its claims, common failure points observed, maintenance needs, and comparisons to similar products. The AI cross-references information (including any related entries in our FPA Dictionary or _SHTF Bible_ scenario requirements) to ensure we didn’t miss context. Human reviewers (from the FPA Gear Council or trusted editors) then double-check the AI report for accuracy and fairness. _In the PowerMaxX example, the AI might produce a report showing: “Charger outputs ~8W under full sun vs. 10W advertised, drops to 2W in partial cloud; casing cracked in one test when dropped – durability concern.”_ This report is shared with all members for open comment. **Rationale:** The AI-assisted review speeds up analysis and helps spot patterns across multiple tests (for instance, if three squads all noted the same weak point, it will flag that). It ensures no single piece of evidence is overlooked. By circulating the findings alliance-wide, we maintain transparency – every member can see the evidence that will inform the endorsement decision and voice any additional insights before we move forward.
