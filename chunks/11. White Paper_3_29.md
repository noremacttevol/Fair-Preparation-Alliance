_Lessons learned:_ We learned early on that enthusiasm often tapers off without reinforcement. Many people join FPA during or after a scare (say, a nearby earthquake) but then get complacent when life feels normal again. A mentor or squad mate can nudge them to keep going. Another lesson: **knowledge transfer accelerates with personal contact.** Reading the FPA Dictionary can teach definitions, but talking to someone who’s “been there, done that” teaches wisdom. One mentor, a veteran of the 1970s New York blackout, shared how critical cash on hand was – a detail his mentee then acted on by building an emergency cash stash, which later helped her when ATMs went down during a power outage. We also found that mentorship combats a common issue: **analysis paralysis** (new folks getting overwhelmed by gear options or scenarios). An experienced prepper can simplify things: “Here’s a short list, just do these first.” On the flip side, mentors reported learning new things too – mentees sometimes bring fresh perspectives or research new tech (like our younger members improving the FPA app features). So it’s two-way learning, reinforcing that everyone has value. We must ensure the mentorship program stays informal and supportive, not bureaucratic. The “honest coach” style is key: frank feedback, no sugarcoating, but also no judgment. If a mentee falls behind, the mentor helps troubleshoot why, rather than scold. A big lesson from failures: if a mentor-mentee pair doesn’t click,
