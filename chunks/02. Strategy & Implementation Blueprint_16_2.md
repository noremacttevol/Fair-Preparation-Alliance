- **Member Voting & Deliberation:** As part of governance support, the app can facilitate member voting on key issues (for instance, if a major change to this Blueprint is proposed, the founding documents might require a membership vote). The voting system is built to be secure (each member gets one vote, votes are anonymous but verifiable in total count). Poll results and any decisions are then logged. In addition to formal votes, there are forums or discussion boards within the app (again with offline capabilities for local caching) where members can deliberate on proposals or share feedback. AI moderation helps keep those discussions civil by flagging toxic language or misinformation, but does not censor viewpoints – it’s just a tool to assist human moderators in maintaining quality discourse.  
- **Alerting & Checks:** The technology can also automatically flag anomalies to governance bodies. For example, if a squad has not run a required drill in a long time, the system might notify that squad’s leader and, if unaddressed, escalate to higher leadership. If an AI moderation event is frequent (like a particular member’s posts are constantly flagged), it might alert moderators to pay attention. These automated alerts ensure nothing slips through the cracks and that the Tribunal or other leaders can focus attention where it’s needed proactively.
