- **Trust Doctrine Integration:** The Trust Doctrine establishes the ethical and operational principles of honesty, verification, and mutual respect within the FPA. In communications, trust is paramount. This doctrine mandates verifying information and source identity, which we implement through protocols (challenge-response codes, multi-source confirmation of intel). We treat every message with a healthy verification process – for instance, if one squad reports an event, another squad or scout should validate it whenever possible ([Hams in Haiti - IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/hams-in-haiti#:~:text=%E2%80%9DHams%20hold%20down%20the%20fort,amateur%20radio%20operators%2C%E2%80%9D%20Pitts%20says)). By doing so, we prevent rumor-fueled mistakes and maintain trust in what’s communicated. The Trust Doctrine also deals with internal trust – our incentive system and training progression mean we **trust but verify** our members’ capabilities. Leaders trust that a Phase 2 operator knows how to handle the radio because they passed the training; subordinates trust that leadership isn’t feeding them lies because truth is a core value.

For example, if we say “Package is delivered” as a code for something, all Alliance members know what that signifies, we are not literally trying to trick
