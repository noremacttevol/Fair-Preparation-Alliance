**Rugged, Tested Gear (Gear Endorsements):** The FPA Gear Endorsements list (see Annex) specifies brands and models of radios, solar generators, batteries, etc., that have been tested for durability and electromagnetic robustness. Members are strongly encouraged to choose endorsed gear. Hardened or simple electronics (e.g. older analog devices, modern mil-spec equipment) are preferred. For example, an analog diesel vehicle or a hand-crank flashlight will laugh off an EMP that would fry modern computerized cars or smart devices ([EMP Attack Survival: Securing Electronics](https://weloveprepping.com/blog/emp-attack-survival-securing-electronics/#:~:text=The%20simplest%20hardened%20electronics%20are,mechanical%20nature%20of%20their%20engines)). Simpler is generally stronger. Where we must use advanced devices (for their capabilities), we compensate by shielding and redundancy. All members should reference _Gear Endorsements Section 4_ for recommended EMP-hardened radios and power units â€“ many have built-in shielding or have passed Alliance tests in high EMP-simulated environments. The Alliance will periodically run EMP simulation tests on sample equipment; results and approved gear will be updated in that list. Remember: a fancy digital tool that fails when needed is worse than a primitive tool that works. We build our comms arsenal accordingly.
