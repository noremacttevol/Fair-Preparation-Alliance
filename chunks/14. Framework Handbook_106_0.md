Some scenarios illustrate how the app and AI enhance operations:  
- **Neighborhood Search:** After a severe storm, a child goes missing. Squad members use the app’s map to mark searched areas, coordinating efficiently. They ask FPAi for search-and-rescue best practices (e.g., how to call out without missing responses, signs of hypothermia to watch for). One member finds footprints in mud; she describes them to the AI, which suggests likely direction (e.g., “footprints in mud often head downhill toward water”). This helps focus the search, and the child is found safe.  
- **Resource Allocation:** A relief truck drops supplies at a community center. Through the app, the chapter coordinator lists what arrived (water, food, tarps). The dynamic pricing logic helps distribute these fairly: households in the flood zone might get first claim on water filters, etc., and points (our internal currency) are used to ensure everyone gets a share. The AI reviews incoming field reports to advise, say, “Area A still lacks clean water, prioritize filters there; Area B’s grocery reopened, so less food aid needed.” It crunches data to assist leaders’ decisions.
