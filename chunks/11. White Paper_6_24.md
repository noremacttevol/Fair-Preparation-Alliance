- _Action Steps:_  
- Survey options for a physical base: Is there a local business, church, school, or even a member’s garage or shed that could host some of your squad’s stuff and possibly serve as a meeting spot or command post during incidents? Approach the owner/authority with your squad’s mission (show your mission statement!) and how it benefits the community. Emphasize transparency and that you’ll take good care of any space or equipment.  
- If granted a space, equip it gradually: a cabinet or tote with first aid supplies, maps, flashlights, copies of important documents (contact lists, maps, protocols), and perhaps spare batteries or a charger. Keep it locked or supervised to prevent misuse (if in a public area).  
- If no dedicated space is available, create a “virtual HQ.” Use a reliable group chat as the day-to-day coordination point. Additionally, prepare a **go-box** that one of the coordinators keeps at home: this box has printed rosters, the map, some basic supplies and maybe a cheap spare phone or radio. This box in an emergency can be brought to a pre-agreed spot to act as a mobile HQ.  
- Publicize (within the group and to trusted community contacts) where the base is or who has the go-box. Everyone should know “if something happens and you’re lost, go here or contact this person.”
