The SHTF Manual & Knowledge Base: Readiness & Drills curates the SHTF Manual – essentially the bible of prepping and crisis response tailored to FPA. It’s a living document, continuously updated with lessons learned and new techniques. They ensure every member has access to it (physical copy and digital via the app). They also maintain the FPA Q&A Knowledge Base, an FAQ-style repository of common questions and answers about Alliance procedures and general preparedness know-how. This team uses these resources to educate members. For example, if someone asks, “What do I do if the power grid fails in winter?” the knowledge base has a clear, vetted answer with steps and references to relevant training material. The Readiness team makes sure information is consistent across all channels – no conflicting advice floating around. They also strongly encourage members to actually read and absorb the SHTF Manual; many squads even require members to pass a quiz on each chapter to earn AP (proving they read it). (For more on how the manual and knowledge base are structured, see the docs on the [[SHTF Manual & Skills Training System]] and the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) Q&A Knowledge Base]].)
