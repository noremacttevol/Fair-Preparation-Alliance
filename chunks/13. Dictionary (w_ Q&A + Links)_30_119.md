A: FPA treats preparedness as an ongoing process rather than a one-time checklist. To continually evaluate and improve, they implement regular reviews and drills. Each member or household is encouraged to do a personal readiness audit periodically (maybe every 6 months): checking food/water stocks, testing gear, and updating plans (did you move? new family member? etc.). Local chapters might hold annual “preparedness Olympics” or competitions that both test skills and make it fun – events like fire-starting races, shelter-building, marksmanship, first aid scenarios – which reveals who’s strong where and who needs more training. They also simulate different seasons and times: a winter storm blackout drill vs. a summer riot scenario, to cover diverse conditions. After each exercise or real incident, they have debrief meetings: what went well, what didn’t, what unforeseen issues came up (maybe everyone grabbed their go-bags but forgot extra glasses or pet supplies, etc.), and those lessons are documented. The alliance leadership compiles major takeaways from across chapters (e.g., “15 groups reported trouble with radio batteries dying too fast – maybe we issue guidance on better battery maintenance or backups”). They update the Compass Guide and knowledge base with these insights, as earlier noted. FPA likely sets progressive goals too: this year, everyone aims to have 1 month of food instead of 2 weeks; by next year, ensure 10% more members get ham licensed; or equip 5 more
