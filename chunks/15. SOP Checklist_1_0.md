**Before you dive in:** This checklist is written in actionable terms. Many items are ongoing duties rather than one-time tasks – preparedness is never “one and done.” Phase 1 is our grassroots stage, meaning resources are limited and _your personal effort matters immensely_. There’s no high-tech substitute or big bureaucracy to pick up your slack. The tone here is intentionally direct: each point tells you exactly what FPA expects you to do. It might feel like a lot – take it one step at a time. As you check off items, you’ll gain competence and confidence, and you’ll be contributing to your squad and community in real ways. Let’s get to it.
