**When digital goes dark, analog takes over.** The System Override SOP is a step-by-step procedure that squads execute when Phase4 is activated:  
1. **Initiate Comm Pulse Check:** The local squad lead kicks off a radio check-in at the designated times (07:00 and 19:00 local) to establish contact with any reachable units.  
2. **Post Emergency Info:** The squad posts an emergency status chart and any critical SOP pages in a common area (e.g. a community bulletin board, squad safehouse wall, etc.) so that all members can physically see the game plan.  
3. **Activate Backup Leader:** If the primary leader is out of contact, the pre-designated backup (fallback lead) takes charge, verified via the paper trust chain (e.g. at least 3 squad members sign off on the leadership handover).  
4. **Deploy Task Cards:** Switch to a manual task assignment system. Hand out printed “task cards” to members, which outline specific duties (patrol area X, check on resource Y, etc.), replacing app-based tasking.  
5. **Maintain Radio Logs:** Keep a handwritten log of all radio communications (timestamp, call signs, messages sent/received). This creates a record of decisions and intel while systems are down.  
6. **Daily Data Backup:** Collect all paper logs and reports at end of day for safekeeping. Once systems come back online, these will be entered into the app for archival and analysis.  
**Radio Network Protocols:** During an override scenario, squads adhere to strict radio habits:
