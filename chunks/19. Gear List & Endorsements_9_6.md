- **No Unauthorized Endorsement Use:** FPA members should not imply FPA endorsement of any gear outside the official process. For instance, if you personally love a tool that FPA hasn’t endorsed, you are free to share your personal opinion, but you must not use FPA’s name or logo in doing so. Similarly, local squads shouldn’t create “rogue” endorsements under the FPA banner without going through the process. This is to prevent confusion and maintain a single source of truth. The only exceptions might be clearly labeled “Local Squad Trial Recommendations” for unique local needs, but these must be marked as experimental/local and not as official FPA endorsements until vetted broadly.  
These ethical safeguards are non-negotiable. They are what protects the Alliance from the typical pitfalls seen in influencer or crowdsourced content platforms. By adhering to them, we ensure that our work remains respected and that our community remains united and focused on our mission. Each member, from leadership to newest recruit, is responsible for upholding these standards. If you see something, say something – we encourage members to kindly call out if a discussion is veering into unethical territory (for example, if someone inadvertently uses fearmongering language, a gentle reminder of our values is welcome). Through collective vigilance, we keep the Alliance strong.
