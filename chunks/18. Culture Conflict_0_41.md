Step 1: In-Circle Remediation Effort – Before leaping to organization-wide intervention, the first escalation step is for the conflict to be addressed at the circle level of the parties involved (if that hasn’t happened already). This corresponds to Step 3 of the squad process above, but more generally, it means: if a conflict was local to a squad, ensure the circle leadership (Trust Liaison, Circle Council) has had a chance to mediate; if a conflict is between members of two different squads in the same circle, bring it to that circle’s council. The circle leadership will treat the dispute as a circle issue rather than just a private team issue. They might organize a circle-level mediation meeting involving representatives from all affected squads. The objective is to resolve it within the circle so it doesn’t have to go higher. For example, suppose Squad A and Squad B (in the same circle) have a conflict over overlapping project mandates. The circle lead would call a meeting with key members of both squads and perhaps an impartial facilitator to hash out roles and responsibilities. They would refer to the circle’s goals and the Alliance values to guide a solution. Only if this fails or if the conflict involves things outside the circle’s authority (like budget allocations that require higher approval) would the next step be taken. This step emphasizes subsidiarity: handle matters in the smallest competent unit first.
