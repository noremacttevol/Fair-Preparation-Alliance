29. **Milestone 29: Evaluate and Refresh the Plan**  
- _Real-World Example:_ After one year, a squad revisited their development plan (which was basically these milestones). They marked off what was done, what wasn’t, and what needed revision. They discovered some steps were no longer relevant or had to be adjusted – for instance, a planned partnership fell through, so they sought a different partner. They also realized they had grown faster than expected, so issues like member management and additional training had to be added. By doing this review, they kept Phase 2 dynamic and responsive to reality, not just a fixed script. Another squad did a quarterly internal audit: two members acted as “inspectors,” checking the supply cache, verifying contact lists, and quizzing a couple of folks on response protocols. This friendly audit caught some lapses (expired food, a phone number change missed in the list) and spurred corrections.
