**Real-World Example:** In 2026, FPA signed a national MOU with FEMA similar to Team Rubiconâ€™s arrangement[fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230907/fema-team-rubicon-sign-agreement-about-preparedness-response-and-recovery#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20,and%20other%20emergency%20management%20operations). When a tropical storm hit North Carolina, an FPA liaison was present at the state EOC. As flooding reports came in, she relayed information from FPA squads on the ground directly to FEMA officials, providing real-time neighborhood-level updates. In turn, FEMA shared broader situational awareness and official relief plans with FPA (via our liaison and Outernet feeds), so our squads knew where not to send volunteers and where help was truly lacking[fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230907/fema-team-rubicon-sign-agreement-about-preparedness-response-and-recovery#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20increased%20partnership%20and%20collaboration,%E2%80%9D).
