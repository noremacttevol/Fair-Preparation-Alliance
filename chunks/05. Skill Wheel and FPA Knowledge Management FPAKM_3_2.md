The **wheel’s overall layout logic** is optimized for clarity and practicality. Text labels for each segment (the category names) are placed along or just outside each slice. If viewing digitally, hovering or tapping on a segment can bring up a tooltip or details (e.g. the exact percentage and a list of sub-skills or qualifications that make up that segment). This layered approach keeps the main graphic uncluttered, while allowing one-click access to deeper information.  
For a clean visual look, the wheel may be depicted as a continuous ring encircling the member’s badge/rank center. A member who is exceptionally advanced in most areas will have a wheel that looks nearly complete – all segments mostly filled, forming an almost solid ring. A member with a mix of strengths and weaknesses will have a more jagged or uneven wheel shape – some segments reaching farther out, others shorter. This creates a unique **“skills profile shape”** for each individual. For example, one member’s wheel might bulge out in the “northwest” quadrant (indicating high First Aid and Comms skills) but be shallower in the “southeast” quadrant (indicating low Navigation skills) – visually encouraging them to focus on that weaker quadrant next.
