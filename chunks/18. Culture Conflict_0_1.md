-->Conflict Handling & Cultural Resilience Framework  
Preamble and Foundational Intent  
The Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) establishes this Conflict Handling & Cultural Resilience Framework as a permanent pillar of our community governance. This document serves as a founding charter for how we address internal disagreements, ensure ethical conduct, and strengthen our culture under pressure. In the spirit of foundational civic documents, it is written to endure, guiding our alliance for decades to come. We recognize that conflict is a natural aspect of collaboration – if harnessed constructively, it can lead to growth and innovation. By handling conflicts openly and fairly, FPA will not only resolve issues as they arise, but continually learn from them, reinforcing our unity rather than allowing divisions to fester. This framework aligns with and builds upon prior FPA doctrines – including our Trust Doctrine (emphasizing honesty and goodwill), Compass Guide (our values and mission alignment), and Governance SOPs (our standard operating procedures for decision-making) – integrating their lessons into a comprehensive strategy for resilience.
