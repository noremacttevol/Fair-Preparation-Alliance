- **CERT Alignment:** Many FPA squads will overlap with or originate from CERT programs. CERT training provides a common language and expectations between citizen responders and professionals ([Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team#:~:text=The%20CERT%20program%20offers%20a,focus%20on%20more%20complex%20tasks)). If your area has an active CERT, coordinate with them – perhaps your squad members _are_ the CERT team for that area. If not, essentially your squad is fulfilling a CERT-like role. Make sure local emergency managers know this. FEMA explicitly encourages CERTs to incorporate HAM radio for comms ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=For%20immediate%20emergency%20management%20purposes%2C,systems%20also%20be%20of%20service)), a practice FPA squads are already pursuing, which is another point of alignment. During official drills or actual responses, CERT teams typically operate under the local Incident Command; your squad, with equivalent training, can do the same. Integration protocol could be: “Report to the Incident Commander or CERT coordinator at the scene, identify as the [Neighborhood] team, and carry out tasks within your training.” Establishing this understanding beforehand (possibly
