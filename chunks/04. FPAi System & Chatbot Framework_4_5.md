FPA’s mission and values. Moreover, **weekly audits** are conducted: transcripts of FPAi’s interactions (with any identifying user info removed) are examined by human reviewers for quality control ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=fpas%20ai%20isnt%20staticit%20evolves,through%20direct%20member%20interaction-rt97ecqma/)). These reviewers check if the AI gave accurate info, if it missed a reference, or if it ventured into areas it shouldn’t. Any false or problematic answer is flagged and corrected in the knowledge base, and the AI is tweaked if needed ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=fpas%20ai%20isnt%20staticit%20evolves,through%20direct%20member%20interaction-rt97ecqma/)). This continuous improvement loop means FPAi gets smarter and more reliable the more it’s used – under human supervision.
