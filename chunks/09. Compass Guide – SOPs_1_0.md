> Canonical terms: [[TERM:Compass]], [[TERM:TMP (Test My Plan)]]  
This guide maps each SOP to its strategic alignment categories using the Compass framework. SOPs must reference their position within:  
- **Direction:** Purpose, Threat Tier, Readiness Context
- **Route:** Inputs, Dependencies, Prep
- **Checkpoints:** Verification steps, Triggers, Pulse Checks, [[TERM:TMP (Test My Plan)]] simulations
- **Destination:** Output conditions, Success criteria  
SOPs built using the Compass must embed canonical terms via `[[TERM:...]]` to ensure future-proof clarity.

**Welcome to the FPA Compass Guide.** This handbook is your orientation to the Fair Preparation Alliance – explaining _why_ we do things the FPA way and _how_ we stay on course. It’s designed to motivate you with a clear-eyed, no-nonsense view of what it means to be part of the FPA.
