PDF to their phone _over a local Wi-Fi_ (no internet needed). We essentially create a **sneakernet / localnet** distribution of data. Our squads set up these nodes at key spots: one might be in each school, one in a town hall, or mobile ones on vehicles. These nodes are loaded with our entire library of FPA knowledge, like a portable internet of preparedness. The QR codes and easy interface (just scan, no need to type weird IP addresses) make it user-friendly in a stressful time. This approach is unique and cutting-edge – it leverages technology, but in a way that doesn’t rely on always-online connectivity. It also means even non-members can spontaneously access a trove of info if they discover the network, because we leave them open or with easy login instructions on printed signs.
