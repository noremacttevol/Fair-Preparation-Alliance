- **Retiring Outdated Practices:** Evolution isn’t just adding new things, but also discarding what no longer works. Perhaps an SOP becomes obsolete (maybe we used to emphasize fax machines as backup, but now that’s irrelevant). We remove or replace it. This prevents clutter and confusion that could come from accumulating too many legacy practices. We always make sure to manage the transition: e.g., announce that “Effective next month, Protocol X is retired and replaced by Protocol Y; here’s how to switch over.” And we always archive the old in case we ever need to revisit.  
- **Member Evolution:** The Living System Clause also recognizes that members themselves evolve. As people grow in skill or age, their roles might change. We ensure there’s space for veterans who might not be able to do heavy field work anymore to still contribute (maybe in training or Tribunal roles). Conversely, we integrate fresh members into responsible positions as they prove themselves. The organization’s structure can flex to accommodate shifts in membership composition, size (scaling up or down as needed), and external partnership (maybe one day we collaborate with other groups – our governance can adapt to that too, under the condition it doesn’t dilute our mission or Trust Doctrine).
