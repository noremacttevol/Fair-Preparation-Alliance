- Periodically audit the member list for inactive or expired credentials and update the registry accordingly.
**Contingency Plan:** If an ID is lost or suspected misused, mark it as void in the registry and inform squads (via Outernet bulletin) to watch for that ID. In politically sensitive situations where carrying an FPA ID could endanger a member, establish a covert verification method (like code phrases) so members can still recognize each other safely.
