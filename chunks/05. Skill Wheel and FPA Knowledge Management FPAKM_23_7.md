In summary, this Skill Wheel and FPAKM system isn’t being built in isolation. It stands on the shoulders of these internal policies and plans. We treat those documents as requirements just as important as the user-facing features. At every design meeting, we ask questions like: _Does this foster trust? Is this terminology consistent? Are we reinforcing our core doctrine values?_ By continuously checking our decisions against the SHTF Bible’s guidance, the AI reliability rules, the Dictionary definitions, and the Trust Doctrine’s principles, we aim to ensure the system remains in harmony with FPA’s identity and mission.
