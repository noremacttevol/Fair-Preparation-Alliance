- Protective Gear: e.g., a specific work glove that lasted longest, a headlamp brand with good runtime, etc.
The list is updated as gear improves or new items prove themselves. It’s not mandatory to only use those items, but strongly suggested to save time and money. Often, FPA coordinates group buys or discounts for items on the list, leveraging bulk purchase or affiliate deals. The Approved Gear List is published on internal sites and taught in workshops – they even have “gear show-and-tell” at meetings where listed items are demonstrated. This curated list comes from field data: members report back on performance in drills or actual events (e.g., “our recommended tent withstood that storm great, but those cheap stakes bent – we’ll note to upgrade them”). By following the Approved List, members equip themselves with trusted gear, streamlining preparation and ensuring interoperability. It embodies the alliance’s principle of sharing knowledge – here, hard-won knowledge about what equipment can be depended upon when lives may depend on it.
