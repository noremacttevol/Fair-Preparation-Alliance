10. **Milestone 10: Secure a Squad Home Base (Physical or Virtual)**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A suburban squad convinced the owner of a local café to let them use the backroom for monthly meetings and to store a couple of lockers with emergency supplies. This “home base” became known in the community – a small FPA sticker in the café window signaled that preparedness folks gather there. In a different scenario, an urban apartment-based squad had no single physical space, so they established a virtual base: a group on a messaging app and a shared cloud folder for documents. That became their hub of coordination. During a citywide blackout, they couldn’t use the cloud, but they had earlier printed key info and stashed it in a member’s apartment (serving as an ad-hoc base).  
- _Lessons Learned:_ Every squad needs a **base of operations**. This could be as simple as a closet of supplies or as formal as an agreement to use a community center office. It provides stability, a rally point, and a place to keep important materials. If a physical space isn’t feasible, designate an alternate method to anchor the group (like an online hub plus some distributed caches of supplies). **Lesson:** A base, even a modest one, greatly improves organization and sustains the squad’s presence. It’s also a psychological anchor – members know “where to go” when unsure.
