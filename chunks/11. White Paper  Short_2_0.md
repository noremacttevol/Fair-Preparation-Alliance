- **Aggressive Realism**— timelines reflect real hazards, not wishful thinking.  
- **Decentralized Execution**— every squad can self‑activate; no single point of failure.  
- **Offline‑First**— every critical step works when the grid is down.  
- **Transparency & Trust**— progress, funding, and metrics surface in the [[Live Audit Feed]].  
- **Iterate → Prove → Scale**— pilot small, log results, then roll out nationally.
