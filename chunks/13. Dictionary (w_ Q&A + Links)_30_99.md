on tasks? If issues arise (say they break a small rule or cause friction), chapter leaders address it early. For existing members, accountability is maintained by a culture of transparency and peer review. They encourage reporting concerns – if someone notices a member doing something unsafe or unethical, they bring it up in council. Meetings might have brief check-ins on any interpersonal issues or rumors to squash them or deal with them directly. Documentation helps too: keeping logs of who attends training, who is assigned which role in a plan, etc., so everyone’s pulling weight. There might even be periodic re-affirmation of the Trust Doctrine or updates to one’s preparedness status, keeping folks engaged and honest. Essentially, FPA uses close community bonds as the glue – in a tight group, it’s hard to hide bad intent or laziness. People are accountable because they care about not letting their friends down. If someone consistently fails that trust, they’ll be counseled and, if needed, asked to leave. In sum: careful entry screening, guided integration, and an environment where members hold each other to high standards ensure that FPA’s roster remains solid and trustworthy.
