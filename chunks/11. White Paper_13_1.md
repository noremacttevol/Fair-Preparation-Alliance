**Lessons Learned:** The drill exposed several issues: initially, some regions had radio silence because their operators didn’t stick to the schedule, highlighting the need for stricter net discipline. We also found that message formats were inconsistent – one relay reworded a request and accidentally changed its meaning. Lesson: standardize message templates so content isn’t lost in translation. On the positive side, we learned that even minimal Outernet text feeds (just a scrolling text bulletin) provided huge morale boosts and coordination when radio was busy. The overarching lesson: practice, practice, practice – nothing replaces doing a dry run.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Plan the drill scenario and objectives clearly (e.g., simulate a multi-region disaster requiring inter-squad aid). Keep it realistic to engage members (no science fiction; stick to likely scenarios like blackout + natural disaster).  
- Announce the drill well in advance and ensure every squad knows how to participate and what comm channels to use. Emphasize that normal communications (phone, internet) are “off-limits” during the exercise to force use of FPA channels.  
- Use a simple, pre-formatted message form for the exercise (e.g., “Resource Request: [What], [Where], [Urgency]”) and disseminate copies of this form beforehand.
