9. **“Vanity Progress” vs. Real Preparedness (Strategic Risk):** This is a broader organizational risk: leadership might inadvertently start focusing on Skill Wheel metrics (like average scores) as a goal in themselves, rather than what those metrics stand for (members actually being prepared). For instance, a danger would be if HQ says “We need to get our average skill level to 60% by next year” and people start chasing that number without truly learning. **Mitigations:** Leadership will be coached to always pair metrics with qualitative and outcome-based indicators. In leadership meetings, when reviewing something like “X% of members are above 50%,” that should be immediately correlated with real-world readiness checks (like “Did those chapters actually perform well in drills?”). If there’s a mismatch, that’s a red flag that we address. We will include qualitative KPIs in our evaluations of readiness – e.g., number of successful missions, community members aided during disasters, etc. Those are the true success measures. The Skill Wheel helps drive those, but it’s not the end goal. By keeping that perspective (metrics as means, not ends), and possibly formalizing it in policy, we guard against chasing numbers. Essentially, we’ll use the data as a tool to ask the right questions and find weak spots, not as the sole determinant of success.
