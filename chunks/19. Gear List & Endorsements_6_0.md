One of the FPA’s rallying cries is **“Fair Prices for Fair Preppers.”** Gear that keeps people alive should not be made artificially expensive through hype or opportunistic supply chain markups. As part of our endorsement doctrine, we’ve built in measures to promote pricing transparency and leverage our collective buying power for the good of members, all while keeping endorsements ethical. Below are the key components of how we handle pricing and procurement in tandem with endorsements:  
- **Full Disclosure of Pricing Factors:** When evaluating gear, the Alliance doesn’t just look at performance – we also examine cost. Our gear review reports include an analysis of pricing: the typical retail price, known wholesale cost if available, and a judgment on whether the price is justified for the value and quality. If an item has an unusually high markup (e.g. a fancy brand name backpack priced five times more than a similar spec backpack), we call that out. This information is included in the endorsement decision. An overpriced item can fail endorsement **on unfair cost alone**, even if it performs decently, because **accessibility is a key part of preparedness**. We believe a tool is only as good as the number of people who can afford to have it. Conversely, if something is cheap but fails in quality, that’s equally disclosed. Our goal is transparency: members should know what they’re paying for (materials, durability, brand tax, etc.).
