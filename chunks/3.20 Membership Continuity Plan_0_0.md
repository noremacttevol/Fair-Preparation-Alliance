In line with its emergency ethos, FPA has a continuity plan for the membership itself – a strategy to keep the Alliance functioning through a crisis. This plan is essentially a “disaster plan for the group”. It outlines how members will reconnect if separated, such as designating predetermined meet-up locations or rally points for each chapter if communications fail. It also defines succession: who takes interim leadership if key coordinators are out of contact or incapacitated, ensuring leadership voids are quickly filled. The continuity plan ensures the knowledge base ([[7.2 FPA Knowledge Vault]]) and critical documents are distributed among members (so loss of one server or one person’s files won’t cripple the info flow). It even covers mundane but important aspects like maintaining an updated emergency contact list of all members’ families (so we can account for everyone). The goal is that the Alliance does not fragment when truly tested – through redundant communication links, backup leadership, and shared information caches, the network of people remains intact and operational even under extreme duress.
