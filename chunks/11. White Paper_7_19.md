- _Vulnerable Population Focus:_ Finally, accessibility extends to who we serve. The squad’s plans prioritize those most at risk (elderly, disabled, low-income) because they often have the least means to prepare themselves. All our contingency plans ask “what about those who can’t [evacuate, communicate, afford supplies]?” and we build solutions (carpool evacuation, radio loaner program, community cache of supplies). By Phase 2’s completion, the squad should be able to confidently say: **anyone** in our community, regardless of status, would have a way to get help through our efforts. That is the measure of equitable preparedness.  
- **Cross-References:** Throughout Phase 2, we link our work with FPA’s foundational references:  
- Terminology from the **FPA Dictionary** is used to ensure consistency. For instance, when we say “aggressive realism” or “decentralized command,” those terms are defined in the Dictionary, and our members are encouraged to consult it. When training new concepts, we might say “this aligns with what the Compass Guide calls ‘distributed comms’ – see that section for more theory” to give depth. Cross-referencing not only educates the squad further but also creates a common language with other FPA groups.
