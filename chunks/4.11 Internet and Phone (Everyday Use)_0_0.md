During non-emergency times or minor incidents, regular internet and phone services form the primary communication backbone for FPA. The Alliance leverages email groups, messaging apps (such as Signal, Telegram, or others chosen for security), and even social media for outreach and daily coordination. Members have a directory of phone numbers and emails to reach each other as needed. Conference call lines or video meetings might be used for planning sessions. A significant part of Phase 1 comms involves staying informed via the internet: members will monitor news sites, weather radar, and official alerts (like FEMA or NOAA feeds). The Alliance may also maintain a website or an online forum for its members (possibly in a secure area) where plans and documents are stored on the cloud for easy access. In essence, FPA takes full advantage of the convenience and speed of the internet and phone networks while they are available – it's the path of least resistance for coordinating meetups, sharing large files (like PDFs of manuals), or rapidly mass-alerting everyone of an emerging issue (through group text alerts or automated call trees). However, all members are reminded that these channels could fail in a disaster, which is why parallel plans ([[4.3.2 Emergency Communication Plan (Phase 2 – Degrading)]] and [[4.3.3 Emergency Communication Plan (Phase 3 – Blackout)]]) are set, ensuring that reliance on internet/phone is tempered with readiness to shift to offline modes.
