4. **Secure your basic gear (“Day Zero” kit):** Assemble your personal **go-bag / Bug-Out Bag (BOB)** if you haven’t alreadyfile-qtxt5lpb9hkk3kkm6pzpag. This is fundamental. At minimum, pack a 72-hour supply of essentials: water (and/or filter), non-perishable food, first aid kit, flashlight, multi-tool, fire starter, extra clothes, and important personal items (medications, copies of IDs). Refer to the FPA-approved gear list and the SHTF Bible’s checklist for guidance on what your bag should have.
