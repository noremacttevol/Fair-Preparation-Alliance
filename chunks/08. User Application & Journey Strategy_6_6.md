- **No phone/app:** Every critical procedure (from how to filter water to how to call for help) is documented in hard copy in the hands of the user ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=the%20fpa%20ensures%20squads%20are,manuals%20for%20plans,%20and%20squad/)). They won’t be fumbling with a dead app because they have a binder or laminated “SHTF playbook” that they helped create.  
- **No centralized server:** The network reorganizes via radio nets. Users have learned to treat radio check-ins as equivalent to app check-ins. (E.g., a member knows that every Sunday at 7pm their squad does a radio muster; in crisis, that becomes the lifeline.) Leadership information is also disseminated offline – e.g., the national team might have pre-recorded emergency instructions that leaders have on paper, only to be opened when needed.  
- **No internet:** The Outernet or pre-distributed content covers that. FPA could even mail out periodic USB or printed newsletters as backup during normal times, so those exist if needed. Each member ensures their crucial data is stored locally – the app might have prompted them periodically: “Download the latest emergency packet to your device/drive.”
