Throughout all our messaging, we emphasize that **the point of the Skill Wheel is not the number itself, but what you do with it.** An individual at 50% who is actively training, improving, and contributing to the group is far more valuable than a “75%” who has grown complacent. This perspective is reinforced in the [[Trust Doctrine]] and core FPA values like humility, continuous improvement, and service. We plan to incorporate snippets of those doctrines into the training materials around the Skill Wheel to continually remind members of the bigger picture. For instance, the Trust Doctrine highlights transparency and not giving false promises – we reflect that by giving realistic feedback (no inflated 100% scores) and openly acknowledging uncertainties. Similarly, the FPA Dictionary will define terms like “Survivability Score” and “Skill Wheel” with guidance on interpretation, ensuring a common understanding across the organization. In essence, we will build a culture around the Skill Wheel that keeps it in proper perspective: it’s a _tool_ to help you prepare, not a trophy or a label defining your worth.
