Not every emergency requires evacuation; in many cases, staying put (sheltering-in-place) is safer. FPA advises households on building robust home emergency supplies to sustain themselves during lockdowns, quarantines, or infrastructure outages. Key categories of shelter-in-place preps include:  
- Water Storage: Aim for at least 1 gallon per person per day for a minimum of 2 weeks. This might mean storing several 5-gallon jugs, using water barrels (55-gal drums) treated with preservative, or even a bathtub water bladder that can be filled quickly when a crisis looms. Alongside stored water, have purification methods (filters, bleach, boiling capacity) to treat additional water if needed.  
- Food Supplies: Stock a pantry with non-perishables to cover the family for multiple weeks or months. FPA recommends foods you actually eat (rotated into normal use) plus some long-term staples like rice, beans, oats, canned goods, dried fruits, nuts, and possibly freeze-dried meals or MREs. Consider nutrition balance and morale boosters (spices, coffee, candy) since eating from storage shouldn’t be misery. Don’t forget baby food or pet food if applicable.
