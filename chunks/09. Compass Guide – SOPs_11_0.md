Compass alignment is not symbolicâ€”it reflects synchronized compliance with:  
- **OpCheck cycles**: All SOP adoption phases must show green in the latest [[TERM:OpCheck]] before member-wide rollout. Failed checkpoints delay procedural integration.
- **Squad Wheel mapping**: SOPs must denote how they affect team dynamics and whether redistribution of roles or redundancies are triggered.
- **Skill Delta tracking**: Each SOP includes an expected skill uplift. Squads are advised to rerun deltas after SOP integration to identify mismatch or lag.
- **Gear Pool impact**: If any SOP mandates new gear validation, it must list sourcing, member burden, and fallback compatibility.
