- **Offline-First Resilience System:** As described earlier, this entire communications doctrine is built around the assumption of no internet or cloud services. That’s exactly what the Offline-First system is about: thriving without reliance on live networks. Our use of **offline AI tablets**, local data caches, and peer-to-peer radio nets exemplifies offline-first thinking. This doctrine ties in by providing the means to distribute and update that offline knowledge. For example, the Alliance might periodically broadcast data updates (like new medical guidelines or maps) via radio data modes that Phase 3/4 members can capture and load into offline devices – a method of “sneakernet” or “air-waves net” distribution that doesn’t require the web. The synergy is that offline content gives members answers even if they can’t ask a superior in real-time. Meanwhile, communications plans ensure they can coordinate actions even if they can’t Google anything or call for help online. By integrating with Offline-First, we ensure our field comm units and personal devices carry everything needed: PDF copies of the Trust Doctrine and Compass SOPs, lists of frequencies, training documents, even encyclopedia entries for general problem-solving – all available offline. The communications doctrine ensures those devices are powered (solar, etc.) and safe (Faraday, etc.), basically enabling the Offline-First toolkit to exist and be used when it’s needed. When members practice drills where they
