**Action Steps:**  
- **Obtain a NOAA weather radio:** This is perhaps the simplest, most vital one-way info source for local emergencies. These radios broadcast 24/7 weather and emergency alerts (NWS). Many models are under $30, some with hand-crank and solar charging. Get one and keep it in your home. Program it for your county’s alerts (instructions included usually). Keep it powered (fresh batteries or plugged in with battery backup). This will alert you to things like tornadoes, chemical spills, etc., even if your phone is off or networks are down.  
- **Set up Outernet (satellite data) if feasible:** FPA is piloting the use of **Othernet/Outernet** receivers. These small devices can receive news, weather, and even curated web content (like Wikipedia snippets or FPA updates) via satellite broadcast, no internet needed ( [Othernet](https://othernet.is/#:~:text=Othernet%20delivers%20a%20multi,communication%20platform%20accessible%20to%20all) ) ( [Othernet](https://othernet.is/#:~:text=Emergency%20Management%20and%20Disaster%20Relief) ). They require an initial hardware cost (~$100 for a basic kit) but no subscription after. If you have the technical interest and funds, consider joining the pilot. We aim to have at least a few members per region with these by Phase3. Even if you personally can’t get one, be aware of who in your squad or area has one (so you know who might have intel post-disaster).
