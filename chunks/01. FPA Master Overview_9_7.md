- **Emergency Response Teams:** Within the Alliance, Readiness & Drills often spearheads forming specialized **Emergency Response Teams** (ERTs) or “go-teams.” These are groups of highly trained volunteers ready to deploy on short notice to an actual crisis outside their immediate community (like aiding a neighboring state after a disaster). They ensure these teams have advanced training in incident command, working with first responders, and self-sufficiency in disaster zones. The content family coordinates with Core and Tech to have caches of pre-packed equipment ready for these ERTs (like portable comm kits, medical supplies, tools). They drill the ERTs separately on rapid mobilization (can we get Team Alpha on the road with all gear within 4 hours of a call?). These teams often end up being our public face in crises, showing up where needed. Readiness ensures they **perform professionally** and are actually helpful, not just well-intentioned amateurs.
