Philosophical and Ethical Dilemmas: “Fairness” vs. Survival Imperatives. FPA’s ethos of fairness – presumably meaning equitable access to preparedness for people of all incomes and backgrounds – is a noble principle, but in practice it may be tested. In a severe disaster, members might face choices between helping others or securing their own families. If FPA doesn’t cultivate a strong altruistic culture, the alliance could fracture under pressure, with some members hoarding resources or refusing to share. Conversely, if the expectation is total selflessness, that may deter pragmatic people from joining. Achieving the right balance is a delicate philosophical challenge. There’s also a blind spot if FPA neglects diversity of needs – “fair” preparation must account for vulnerable groups (disabled, elderly, etc.), or it risks being fair in name only.
