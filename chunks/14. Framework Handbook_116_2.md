- **Leveraging the AI:** The AI assistant helps coordinate information internally. It summarizes damage reports so leaders can quickly brief everyone (“10 houses destroyed in Zone A, major flooding in Zone B, etc.”). It’s also used by members for reference – e.g., someone heading out to clear debris asks, “What precautions for downed power lines?” and it reminds them of the proper safety steps from the SHTF Bible. If there’s uncertainty about the chemical spill, the AI provides guidance on decontamination measures.  
- **Public Outreach & Trust:** FPA doesn’t operate in a vacuum – squads actively collaborate with neighbors and local authorities. Because we built trust earlier, the community welcomes our help. FPA volunteers set up a public charging station using solar panels and invite anyone to use it. We organize a community meal from thawing freezer food (since power’s out, might as well cook it) – our Training & Education folks even get kids involved in a safe activity to keep them occupied. These actions foster solidarity beyond FPA’s ranks and position the Alliance as a key player in the community’s recovery.
