**Description:** Roll out the first **Outernet** pilot program in a chosen region to test satellite-based information delivery. The pilot involves equipping squads in that region with Outernet receivers and broadcasting curated emergency content (weather alerts, maps, briefings) via satellite. This small-scale deployment will validate the technology’s practicality and train FPA members to use it, paving the way for national (and later global) Outernet integration.
**Real-World Example:** FPA selected the Gulf Coast (Region IV) for the initial Outernet pilot in early 2025, given its vulnerability to hurricanes. During a simulated Category 4 hurricane exercise, local internet and cell networks were assumed down. Squads in coastal Mississippi and Alabama pointed their kit-built satellite receivers skyward and successfully downloaded a daily brief containing NOAA hurricane track updates, safety advisories, and a list of open shelters – all via the Outernet signal, independent of ground infrastructure.
