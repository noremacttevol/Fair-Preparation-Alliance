6. **Gaming the System or Vanity Behavior:** Despite our precautions, some individuals might attempt to cheat (for example, by finding answer keys to quizzes, or falsely claiming they did a drill) or start caring more about their score than the mission. **Mitigations:** We’ve made cheating on quizzes harder by having large question banks and randomizing questions. Many of our quizzes might even be open-book – which sounds counterintuitive, but in real life the ability to quickly find and apply information is as valuable as memorizing it. If it’s open-book, “cheating” by looking up answers is actually just learning. For hands-on claims, that’s where verification comes in. FPA has a strong community aspect; typically, if someone claims they completed a certain training, there will be a record or witnesses. The **honor code** within FPA (part of the Trust Doctrine ethos) will also be emphasized: lying about your preparedness is a serious breach of trust because it could endanger lives. Culturally, anyone caught faking things will face social consequences and possibly be reset in the system (we might revoke unearned points). As for vanity, by removing public ranks and fostering team play, we minimize avenues for grandstanding. If someone tries to flaunt their wheel, usually their peers or leaders will gently put it in context (“Great, you have 80% – maybe you can help the team by teaching a class, instead of boasting.”).
