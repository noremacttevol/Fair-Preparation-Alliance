At the heart of the FPA are six core values that every member strives to uphold. These guiding principles define “fair preparation” and shape every decision and policy in the alliance:  
- **Fairness:** We ensure equitable treatment and sharing within the group. Preparedness resources and information are accessible to everyone, not hoarded by a few. _Fair preparation_ means balancing your own family’s needs with compassion for others when possible – you help your neighbors because someday you may need their help too.  
- **Integrity:** We value honesty and trustworthiness, doing what’s right even under stress. In practice, this means keeping your promises to your squad, reporting truthfully on your readiness status, and adhering to laws and ethical codes. Trust is the currency of any survival group – without integrity, the whole alliance falls apart.  
- **Realism:** Our plans are grounded in facts and likely scenarios, not wild speculation. We don’t indulge in conspiracy theories or fantasy; we focus on practical threats (storms, outages, civil unrest, etc.) and use evidence-based strategies. Realism also means acknowledging our limits and the harsh truths of disaster – no hype, no wishful thinking. If an idea doesn’t work in real life, we discard it.
