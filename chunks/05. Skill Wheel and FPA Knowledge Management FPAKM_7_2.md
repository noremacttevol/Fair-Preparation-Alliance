In computing these scores, the AI cross-references the member’s skills with a knowledge base of what’s required to survive specific situations (this knowledge base comes from historical data, expert input, and models that FPAi has been trained on). For instance, suppose historical data or expert guidelines indicate that surviving a severe winter blizzard requires at least 40% competency in First Aid (for treating frostbite or hypothermia), 50% in Survivalcraft (for keeping warm, managing a heat source safely, etc.), and some level of Comms (to call for help or coordinate). If the member meets or exceeds those thresholds, their likelihood of making it through is high; if they fall short in one area (say they lack medical know-how), that area becomes a vulnerability pulling down their overall survival projection. Importantly, FPAi will be **transparent** in how it derives the score. Instead of just giving a number, it will provide an explanation such as:  
> _“Overall Survivability: 68%. **Strengths:** Navigation and Comms are high (these will help in most scenarios). **Risks:** Below-average medical skills could pose an issue in common regional threats (e.g. earthquake-related injuries).”_
