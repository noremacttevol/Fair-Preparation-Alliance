FPA’s organizational structure is designed to balance effective coordination with local autonomy. At a high level, the Alliance functions as a network of regional and local groups (often called “chapters” or cells) that operate under shared FPA guidelines. There is a national coordination layer that develops overall strategy ([[Strategic Plan Overview (3-Phase Approach)]]) and provides support and standards (e.g., the [[Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)]]). This national layer is guided by a central leadership team ([[National Leadership Structure]]) which sets broad policies and ensures consistency with FPA’s mission. Below this, local chapters are the heart of FPA: typically organized by city, county, or community, each with its own leadership roles ([[Local Chapter Leadership]]) and members. Local groups have autonomy to address their specific needs and threats while following core FPA doctrines (like the [[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]] and [[Operational Security (OPSEC) Measures]]). Communication flows two ways: the national team offers guidance and resources (like training materials or the [[Approved Gear List Overview]]), and local chapters provide feedback, share lessons learned, and contribute new ideas (ensuring [[Member Participation in Governance]]). The structure also includes functional teams or committees across the network for special areas – for instance, an AI oversight committee (see [[AI Oversight and Ethics Guidelines]]) or a communications network
