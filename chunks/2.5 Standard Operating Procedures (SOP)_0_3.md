The SOP is essentially the manual that turns FPA’s plans into actionable steps. It is kept up-to-date (currently Mk1Mod3 revision) by the leadership with member input. New members are trained on the SOP as part of [[Onboarding New Members]]. Many chapters conduct “SOP drills” – e.g., testing that every member knows how to respond to a mock alert per the SOP instructions. Because situations can evolve in unpredictable ways, the SOP also contains a principle: “When in doubt, fall back on FPA core values and best judgment.” Members are trusted to improvise if needed, but within the guardrails the SOP sets. Through adherence to the SOP, FPA ensures consistency and coordination – it’s what allows a dispersed network to function like a single organism under stress. (Cross-ref: The SOP heavily ties into notes across all categories, notably communication, security, and activation protocols, as it encapsulates many of those details in one reference.)
