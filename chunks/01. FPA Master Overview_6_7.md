- **AP Decay and Inactivity:** To keep people from sitting on old laurels, we have an AP **decay system for inactivity**. If you go inactive (no participation, no check-ins) for, say, 6 months, a small percentage of your AP is deducted or rather “frozen”. It can be reactivated when you resume participation, possibly with a penalty. The idea is, rank should reflect _current capability and commitment_, not just past. A highly ranked member who disappears for a year and comes back shouldn’t expect to waltz into commanding people without refreshing their skills. We’ll work with returning members to get them back up to speed, of course, but AP and rank will adjust to ensure safety and effectiveness.
