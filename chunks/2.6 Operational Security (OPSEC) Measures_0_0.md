OPSEC refers to the practices FPA uses to protect sensitive information and plans from falling into the wrong hands. Given that knowledge of who has what supplies or where members are gathering could be exploited by malicious actors (looters, hostile groups, or even overly curious authorities), FPA places strong emphasis on OPSEC throughout its operations. Key OPSEC measures include: Need-to-Know Information Sharing – Members are only given information relevant to their role or local area. For example, a member knows the identities and addresses of their immediate chapter mates but might not know members in a distant chapter unless necessary (so if one member is compromised, they can’t expose the whole network). Similarly, details of caches or backup routes are compartmentalized. Use of Codes and Codenames – In communications, especially over potentially monitored channels like radio, FPA uses pre-arranged codewords for locations, people, or statuses. For instance, a chapter might refer to their meetup spot as “Depot Blue” instead of the actual name, or use a phrase like “The weather is stormy” to indicate a certain security threat level without alerting outsiders. Each chapter might have variations of codes, and the [[Communication Protocols and Etiquette]] note outlines how to use them. Cover Stories – Members are encouraged to have a benign explanation for their preparedness activities. If someone asks why they have so much food stored, they might say they bulk-buy to save
