The offline-first approach is one major pillar of resilience:  
- As described, the FPA App is fully functional offline. This principle extends further: all **critical knowledge** (training content, emergency protocols) is distributed among members, not held only in a central repository. If FPA as an organization were suddenly unable to communicate, each squad and member still has the knowledge and tools to carry on.  
- We adopt a **graceful degradation** approach: when one layer fails, operations continue on a lower layer without chaos. Example: If the AI assistant goes down, members rely on SOPs and human judgement. If the digital comms fail, they switch to radio. If radio fails, they have pre-arranged meeting points/times and physical signals. Nothing is left to improvisation at the moment – there’s a backup method defined beforehand.  
- **Decentralized Data:** We intentionally avoid centralizing all data in one place. Each member’s app is a mini data vault. The loss of any single device, or even a server, doesn’t lose the knowledge; others have copies. This decentralization makes the system robust against targeted attacks or accidents – there is no single “data center” whose destruction would wipe us out. Even the transparency log is redundantly stored (with copies or secure hashes held by multiple members or devices).
