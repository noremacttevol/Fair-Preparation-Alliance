- **Maintenance:** Key maintenance needs. _Example:_ “Clean pre-filter every 50 liters. Replace main filter after 2000L or if flow too slow. Store dry.”  
- **Included Items:** (If applicable, what comes with it – e.g., “bucket adapter, cleaning syringe, manual.” This helps if someone finds just the device, they know if anything is missing.)  
- **Relevant FPA Logs:** (If space, a note like “See FPA Log for full test reports and vendor notes.” Possibly include a QR code or shortened URL pointing to the online profile for more info, for when connectivity is available or later reference.)  
- **Alliance Notes:** Maybe an alliance motto or reminder, like: _“Endorsed by FPA to keep you prepared. Verify equipment regularly – Trust, but verify (even the trusted).”_  
The Field Card is meant to be concise and handy. Think of it like a cross between a product info sheet and a playing card. It gives enough info to operate and maintain the item effectively and to remember why we trust it, without needing a whole manual. For print, these might be double-sided on index-card stock or regular paper that can be laminated. The template above would be adjusted slightly to fit a nice layout.
