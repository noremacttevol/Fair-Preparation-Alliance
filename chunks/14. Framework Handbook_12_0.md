The Trust Doctrine isn’t just internal. It also guides how we interact with the broader community:  
- **Trust with the Public:** FPA squads strive to be trustworthy neighbors in their towns. This means being honest and transparent about what we do, to dispel any misconceptions (“preppers” sometimes get a bad rap as secretive hoarders). By volunteering in local events and sharing knowledge openly, we build trust with non-members. That pays off during crises – people are more likely to cooperate with or join an alliance they trust.  
- **Trust with Officials:** We engage local emergency managers and first responders in dialogue and invite them to observe our drills. By demonstrating professionalism and reliability, we’ve started to build trust with these officials. In some areas, they now view FPA squads as auxiliary support rather than fringe groups. That trust can open doors to coordination (like getting access to early warnings or sharing resources in an emergency).  
- **Data and Privacy:** With the introduction of our FPA App and AI (Chapter 9), we collect some data (e.g., training records, inventory status). The Trust Doctrine dictates that this data is kept confidential and used only for alliance purposes to help members – never sold or misused. Members have control over their information. By clearly stating and following these privacy rules, we maintain digital trust as well as personal trust.
