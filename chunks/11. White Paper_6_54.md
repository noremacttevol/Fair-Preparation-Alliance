- _Action Steps:_  
- Choose a highly visible, accessible location in the community that could serve as an information posting spot. It might be a bus stop shelter, outside a popular shop (get owner permission), a community center door, or a member’s front fence that faces a street.  
- Set up a weather-resistant board if possible (laminated plywood, corkboard with plastic covering, even just a taped plastic sleeve for papers). In normal times, use it for posting preparedness content (flyers, “tip of the week”, squad meeting invites). This trains people to look there.  
- Develop an “info hub plan” for emergencies: Who will physically update the board and how often? Prepare some pre-written templates to post: e.g., a blank form that you can quickly fill in with key info (situation summary, where to get help, next update time). The Compass Guide may have templates for community bulletin in crises – use them if available.  
- Announce to neighbors that this board is where they can find info if phones are out. Include that in any flyers or meetings: “If everything goes dark, go to [Location] for updates.” Also, let your partner agencies (from Milestone 17-19) know that this is part of your plan – they might deliver official messages for you to post.
