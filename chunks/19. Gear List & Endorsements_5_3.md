- **Vendor Ethics and Alliance-Friendly Status:** While no vendor can buy influence, those who demonstrate alignment with our values can earn an “Alliance-Friendly” note in our system. This is not an endorsement of their products per se, but an acknowledgment that, for example, a company consistently responds to issues ethically (honoring warranties, not price-gouging during crises, etc.). Such notes can help members in deciding whom to trust when shopping. Conversely, vendors that engage in shady practices (false advertising, exploiting disasters to jack up prices, harassing our members, etc.) will be noted or even **blacklisted** in our system. Blacklisting means we warn members about doing business with them at all, and we may refuse to even consider their products until they’ve made amends. These measures pressure vendors to **play fair** if they want the sizable FPA community to consider their wares.
