Imagine a scenario: A severe earthquake has struck a region. Power, water, and internet are down. The local FPA squads mobilize. They’ve followed their SOPs for initial response (Chapter 5), accounted for people, addressed immediate injuries. Now, as they settle into day 2, the challenges shift to sustaining themselves and the community:  
- The Medic consults the SHTF Bible’s section on improvised wound care to ensure they’re properly treating a member’s deep cut with the limited supplies at hand.  
- The Logistics Officer references the water purification chapter because their stored water is running low and they need to start treating water from a river. They choose a method (making a sand-charcoal filter, then boiling) based on the guide’s instructions.  
- Members collectively read the earthquake-specific tips: watching out for aftershocks, how to safely remove debris when helping neighbors, and precautions about gas line leaks. This information guides their actions as they fan out to assist the neighborhood.  
- When a rumor spreads that a nearby dam might break (a cascading crisis concern), the Communications Lead uses the app’s AI (which draws on the SHTF Bible) to get a quick overview: what to do in flash flooding, safe zones to move to on higher ground, etc. They double-check that info in the relevant chapter to plan a potential evacuation route.
