Q26: How does physical fitness relate to prepping?
A: Being in decent physical shape can make a huge difference in an emergency. Disasters often demand sudden bursts of effort – you might have to walk long distances, lift heavy objects, run, climb, or go without sleep. If you’re very out-of-shape, tasks like evacuating on foot with a backpack or even just handling the stress can be much harder or impossible. Physical fitness (strength, endurance, flexibility) means you tire less quickly and are less prone to injury. It also tends to improve your overall health, which can reduce medical issues during stressful times. In short, a fit person can do more and cope better when things get tough. You don’t need to be an athlete, but regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight will increase your odds of weathering a crisis and carrying out your plans. [#Beginner] [#Health]
