Graduated Responses: Our framework favors mild interventions first, escalating only if behavior doesnâ€™t change. For example, if a member violates a conduct code (say loses temper and insults a colleague), the first step is likely a mediated conversation and a warning with an expectation to apologize and reform. Only if they repeat or refuse would stronger action (like removal from a role or Alliance) be considered. This way, people have a chance to learn from mistakes without fear that any misstep will doom them. It encourages coming forward and admitting fault, since the culture is to help you fix it, not to expel you immediately.
