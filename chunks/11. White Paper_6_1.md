- Create a simple pitch (flyer or 2-minute spiel) explaining FPA’s mission and why a local squad matters. Emphasize protecting _our_ neighborhood.  
- Host an info session or table at a community event (even if it’s just a folding table at the park). **Talk to people** – nothing beats face-to-face enthusiasm.  
- Use free outreach: library bulletin boards, neighborhood Facebook/WhatsApp groups, local radio PSAs, and word-of-mouth through existing community leaders.  
- Start a sign-up sheet (online or paper) to capture contact info of interested folks; follow up within 48 hours so momentum isn’t lost.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If turnout is low, don’t be discouraged – a squad can start with just 2–3 committed people. In a pinch, begin with family and friends. If public meetings aren’t allowed (e.g. pandemic restrictions), pivot to virtual meetups or one-on-one outreach. Always have an **elevator pitch** ready; even a chance encounter can recruit a member. To navigate skepticism, be transparent about goals and avoid jargon – build trust gradually. Worst-case, tie into an existing volunteer network (like CERT or a church group) as a starting nucleus rather than going it entirely alone.
