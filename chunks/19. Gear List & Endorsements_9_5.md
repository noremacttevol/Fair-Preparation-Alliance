- **Respect and Accuracy in Reporting:** Members are expected to report test results and opinions honestly and thoroughly. Do not omit negative findings because you personally like a product; conversely, don’t omit positives just because you dislike a brand. Stick to what you observe. If you make a claim (e.g., “the tent fabric tore under slight pressure”), be ready to show evidence or walk through your testing method. This ethical standard is what gives our endorsements weight. If a member is found falsifying data or plagiarizing other reviews instead of doing real tests, that’s a serious violation. It not only invalidates that gear’s evaluation but harms our collective credibility. The Trust Doctrine provides guidelines for remediation or removal of members who can’t commit to honest reporting.
