_(There is a concept of “Phase 4” where the alliance transitions to a self-governing, AI-optimized system beyond 100k members, but that’s far in the future – essentially an open-governance era where our structure becomes very flexible. For now, Phases 1–3 give us a clear roadmap.)_  
By understanding these phases, you as a member know not just where we are today, but where we’re headed. It helps to put things in perspective. For example, if some processes seem a bit manual or rough around the edges right now (Phase 1), you know it’s because we prioritize action and real-world testing over polish – and that improvements (Phase 2 automation) are on the horizon once we have the manpower. Conversely, if you hear about grand ideas like AI-driven logistics or nationwide networks, you know those are Phase 3 aspirations being built step-by-step, and you can find ways today to contribute to laying that groundwork (like getting your HAM license to be part of the Outernet project eventually).  
Each phase builds on the previous one; nothing gets scrapped, only strengthened. Phase-1 grassroots grit will always be in our DNA, even when fancy tools come in Phase 3. The Compass Guide will be updated as we transition phases, but its job remains the same: to keep our mission clear and our methods justified to every member coming on board.
