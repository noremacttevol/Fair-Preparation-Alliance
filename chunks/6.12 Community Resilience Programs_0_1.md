FPA also experiments with neighborhood resilience teams: they encourage members to lead or join local CERT teams or start preparedness clubs at schools, effectively seeding the wider community with knowledge and cooperative spirit. By taking initiative in these programs, FPA positions itself not just as a consumer of innovative gear, but as a creator of innovative community practices. This kind of innovation is measured in trust and social capital: when disasters strike, neighborhoods that have these programs can organize more quickly and help each other, which is ultimately what FPA is about – people innovating to help people.
