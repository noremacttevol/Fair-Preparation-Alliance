**Living Document:** “Mk1Mod3” indicates this is the Mark1, Module3 version – in plain terms, the third major update to our first edition. We will continue to update this roadmap as new technologies emerge (for instance, improvements in off-grid communication or AI planning tools) and as we gather results from pilot programs and drills. It’s a living document that will evolve with input from the community. Members are encouraged to provide feedback via the FPA app or at annual meet-ups. All updates will maintain the roadmap’s blunt, **pragmatic tone** – if something isn’t working, we’ll say so and adjust. Transparency is paramount: all members will know what the plan is, what changes are made, and why.
