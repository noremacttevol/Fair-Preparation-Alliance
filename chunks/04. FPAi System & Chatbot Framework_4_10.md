questions (like inquiries about weapons or civil unrest) to ensure it responds within policy. Additionally, **privacy is respected**: FPAi only asks for data that helps with preparedness and keeps it secure. Sensitive member data is minimal and protected with encryption and strict access control ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=q60,secure%20data/)) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=q61,member%20data/)). The AI itself doesn’t store personalized conversation histories indefinitely – personal plan details stay private to your account. And if you ever choose to leave FPA, you can request your data to be deleted per our data policies. All these measures – from ethical rule-setting to privacy safeguards – are in place so that you can trust FPAi as a _responsible_ tool. We know that trust is earned, especially with AI. FPAi earns it by being transparent, consistent with FPA’s values, and by remaining under careful human watch.
