**Phase1.3: Achieve basic survival provisioning for all members – at least a 14-day supply of essentials by Q4 2025.**
_Real-world example:_ In numerous disasters (from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to the Texas deep freeze of 2021), it’s clear that outside help might not arrive for **days or even weeks**. In Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, entire communities were on their own for over two weeks with no power and scant supplies. Every FPA member must be able to sustain themselves and their household for a minimum of 14 days without resupply. A tangible example: during the 2017 California wildfires, one FPA member’s home was cut off by road closures. Thanks to her **2-week stockpile** of food, water, and medicine, her family was safe and even helped a neighbor who hadn’t prepared. In contrast, we saw what happened to thousands of unprepared families in the COVID-19 lockdowns – panic buying, empty shelves – those with a pre-stocked pantry avoided that chaos entirely. The aim is that when crisis hits, _no FPA member is standing in FEMA’s food line on day 3; we take care of our own needs and can even assist others._
