13. **Milestone 13: Safety and Self-Protection Protocols**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A volunteer in an earthquake response squad rushed into a partially collapsed house to check for occupants – without proper gear or backup. He ended up injured by falling debris. After this scare, that squad formalized a strict rule: _no member goes into a dangerous situation alone or without safety equipment._ They acquired hard hats, goggles, and dust masks and instituted a buddy system for any hazardous task. Similarly, a storm response team learned to pause and check for downed power lines and other hidden dangers before rushing into the fray. These protocols prevented further accidents.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ **The squad can’t help others if its own members become casualties.** Integrate safety into every action. This includes personal protective equipment (PPE) and procedural rules like working in pairs. Transparency in FPA includes being honest about risks – discuss them openly so everyone respects the danger. **Lesson:** Heroics are less useful than steady, safe operations. A well-prepared squad looks after its own first (oxygen-mask principle) so they can sustain helping the community.
