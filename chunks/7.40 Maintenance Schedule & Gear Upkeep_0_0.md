Gear is only as good as its condition, so FPA emphasizes regular maintenance:  
- Inspection Checklists: The Alliance provides checklists for members to routinely inspect their gear (e.g., every 6 months or with seasons). This includes checking batteries (and replacing or recharging them), looking for corrosion or wear on tools, ensuring filters havenâ€™t expired, and confirming fuel stores are stabilized.  
- Rotation of Supplies: Food, medicine, and batteries are rotated out before expiration. Many use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method in their storage pantry, consuming older stocks in everyday life and restocking with fresh supplies. Fuel in generators or vehicles is used and refilled periodically to keep it fresh.  
- Cleaning and Repairs: After any field use or annually if in storage, items like tents, sleeping bags, water containers, and clothing are cleaned and properly dried to prevent mildew or deterioration. Tools are oiled, knives sharpened, firearms cleaned and lubed. Water filters are sanitized and dried per manufacturer guidance (or replaced if at end-of-life). Electronics are powered up to ensure capacitors, etc., still work and firmwares are updated if applicable.
