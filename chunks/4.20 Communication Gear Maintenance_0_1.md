their devices labeled with their name/contact so lost items can be returned at gatherings. By treating radios, phones, and other communicators as vital equipment that needs care (just like one would maintain a car or a generator), the Alliance ensures that when the moment comes to use them under duress, they will perform reliably. A well-maintained $30 walkie-talkie can end up being a lifesaver if it’s the only link—so they treat it with the respect and upkeep any life-safety tool deserves.
