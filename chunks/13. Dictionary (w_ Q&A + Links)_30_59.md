A: FPA maintains a cycle of continuous improvement and revision for its knowledge base (like the Compass Guide, SHTF Bible, etc.). They probably have a committee or working group dedicated to updating materials. After any major event or drill, they do after-action reviews and capture lessons learned. Those get fed back into the documents – for example, if a new technology proved useful, they’ll add a section about it; if a certain plan failed in practice, they’ll revise the strategy. They keep an eye on current events and evolving threats: as new types of emergencies emerge (say, cyber-attacks causing infrastructure collapse), they integrate guidance on those. They also solicit feedback from the membership: maybe an annual survey or open forum where members can suggest changes or new entries for the dictionary/knowledge base. With many members in different fields, someone might say “hey, I’m a paramedic and I see we should update our medical section with the latest CPR guidelines” – and they do. The versioning (like Mk1Mod3 implies there were prior Mods) shows they iterate. They might label materials with a version and date and encourage members to replace old copies. The presence of an AI reliability and oversight document suggests they even examine how using AI (like maybe an AI-driven advice system) should be monitored. Strategically, they might also simulate future scenarios (“what would prepping look like in 2030?”) to anticipate needed skills or focus. By being a
