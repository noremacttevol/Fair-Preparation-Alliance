**Broader Mission Scope:** Under Mk1Mod2, the focus was primarily on individual and family preparedness. Mk1Mod3 expands this scope to **community-wide resilience**. The strategy now explicitly encourages forming local squads and networks, recognizing that no single family can handle a cascading crisis alone. In practice, this means FPA now emphasizes organizing neighborhoods and small towns into support groups that can share resources and information during emergencies.  
**Fairness & Accessibility:** Fairness has always been part of FPA’s ethos (it’s in our name), but Mk1Mod3 introduces concrete measures to make preparedness accessible to all. One major strategic addition is a **dynamic pricing system** for gear and training (detailed in Chapter 10). In essence, the Alliance has adopted a sliding-scale model so that members with fewer financial resources can obtain critical supplies at lower cost, while those with more means pay a bit more. This ensures “no one gets left behind” due to money. Such tiered pricing models have proven effective in other community services, with higher-income participants helping subsidize access for lower-income members. The result is a more inclusive preparedness movement, directly addressing the well-known gap where lower-income households often struggle to prepare and are disproportionately impacted by disasters.
