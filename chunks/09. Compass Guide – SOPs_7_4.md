We will also see an **Officer Corps** taking shape – experienced E-9s moving into roles like regional directors (O-5, O-6) and a national executive team (O-9, O-10) who handle cross-region decisions.

Throughout Phase 3, the Compass Guide’s principles are our compass (pun intended) – with so many moving parts, those core values ensure we never lose sight of our founding purpose: _neighbors helping neighbors survive and recover, fairly and together._ By the end of Phase 3, the goal is that the FPA can handle a full-blown national disaster with the same confidence and coordination that a single squad handles a local storm in Phase 1.
