Liaison with Media and Authorities: Comms & Outreach serves as the liaison for media inquiries and relationships with external authorities (from a communications standpoint). For example, if a city’s emergency management office wants to involve FPA in a disaster drill, the Outreach team coordinates the PR around it and ensures it aligns with our image. They prepare press releases for major milestones (“FPA reaches 20k members, implements novel funding model”) and handle press during crisis deployments (making sure if FPA volunteers are interviewed, the narrative stays on point). They might also coordinate with local law enforcement or NGOs about how to present joint efforts to the public. Basically, they make sure that whenever FPA is in the public eye, we come across correctly and capitalize on the exposure to gain support or members.  
In summary (though this team’s work is ongoing), Comms & Outreach keeps the Alliance connected internally and respected externally. They ensure that critical information flows to members reliably and that our message to the world is clear and positive. This content family grows the Alliance’s ranks and keeps its spirit high. They prove that effective communication – whether it’s a rallying call to our own, or an olive branch to the community – is as vital to preparedness as any stockpile or strategy.
