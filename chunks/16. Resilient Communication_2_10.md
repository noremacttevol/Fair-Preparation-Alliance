**Alliance Incentives for Hardening:** To reinforce the importance of EMP-proofing, the FPA offers **Alliance Points** and rank recognition to members and squads who upgrade their systems to meet this doctrine. For instance, constructing a proper Faraday cage for your home base and demonstrating its effectiveness (e.g., via an Alliance mentor inspection or by showing that a radio inside cannot receive a strong outside signal) will earn you Alliance Points. Upgrading to a solar-battery rig with EMP protection, or training in EMP response protocols, likewise counts toward your Operational Readiness score. These points feed into our trust and rank system – meaning members who take action to harden their gear gain standing in the community. This isn’t about gamification; it’s about aligning incentives with survival. We want every member eager to close that last gap in their preparedness. By rewarding proactive hardening, we ensure the Alliance as a whole becomes more resilient. Leaders should publicly recognize members who achieve EMP-resistant setups, perhaps even granting them titles (e.g. “Gridfall Ready”) or additional responsibilities like advising others in the chapter. The Alliance may also organize group-buys or grants for costly hardening equipment (like high-grade surge protectors or specialized Faraday enclosures) so that even low-resource members can participate – in exchange for a commitment to share those resources in a crisis. In short, **we invest in resilience,
