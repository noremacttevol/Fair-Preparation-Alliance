**Notes on the Table:** Enlisted ranks (E-1 to E-10) are on the “Core” path required for everyone. After E-10, a member can either remain in core (as a Master, potentially pursuing a Prestige project) or branch into the Officer path if elected. The Prestige track is shown as an _alternative E-10_ achievement – it’s not a numbered rank beyond E-10, but rather a special designation at the Master level for a unique contribution (hence the “E-10 Prestige” row). Officer ranks (O-1 to O-10) are only attained via election/appointment and involve leadership roles of increasing scope.  
The **AP Floor** column shows cumulative points needed; the **AP Slope** indicates how much more AP is required compared to the previous rank. You can see the slope increases in general as ranks go up (meaning you need to put in more effort between high ranks than between low ranks). The **Validation Type** and **Validation Index** columns indicate the rigor of approval needed: early ranks are mentor-verified or automatic, while top ranks need board or full membership approval. For example, E-2 Apprentice has validation “Automatic” with index 0 (you pass the quiz, you’re promoted), whereas O-10 Alliance Commander requires a full member vote (index 4).
