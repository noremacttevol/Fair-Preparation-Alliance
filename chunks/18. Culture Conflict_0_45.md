decision to protect the Alliance’s integrity. Any such decision will be based on FPA’s established policies and values (no ad hoc or arbitrary rulings). For instance, if two factions in the Alliance disagree on a political stance the FPA should take, and it threatens to split the membership, the Council might decide on a position after consulting all sides and perhaps put it to a movement-wide vote if appropriate. The key is that the highest leadership steps in to prevent a stalemate from paralyzing or breaking the organization.
