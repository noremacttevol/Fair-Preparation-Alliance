As members improve their skills, their wheel **“fills out”** accordingly, providing a tangible sense of accomplishment while making it easy to spot skill gaps (the unfilled portions of segments). To prevent discouragement, **no segment ever appears fully empty**. Per FPA policy, every member starts with a minimum **10% baseline** in each category – visually, a small sliver of each segment is filled in from the start. This baseline serves two purposes: it avoids the demoralizing appearance of a 0% skill (since no one in FPA is at absolute zero; even a novice has _some_ foundational knowledge), and it reflects that basic orientation training or common knowledge gives everyone at least a sliver of capability in all areas. For instance, a brand-new recruit who has completed the entry orientation would still see ~10% filled on all segments. This design choice reinforces confidence and acknowledges that **everyone has something to contribute**, while a completely blank segment could imply “you have nothing at all to offer here,” which is never true in a team context.
