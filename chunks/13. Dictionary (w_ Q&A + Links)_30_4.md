Q2: What is the “Compass Guide” in FPA?
A: The “Compass Guide” is an FPA handbook that provides direction (hence the name) for members’ preparedness efforts. Think of it as a comprehensive guidebook or blueprint for how to prepare effectively, step by step, in line with FPA’s principles. It covers the foundational aspects of prepping: assessing your risks, making a plan, gathering essential supplies, developing key skills, and so on – laid out in a structured way that even a newcomer can follow. The Compass Guide also incorporates FPA’s values (like fairness and community) into its advice. For example, it includes guidelines on sharing knowledge with neighbors and balancing personal readiness with helping others, keeping that “fair preparation” philosophy in view. Essentially, the Compass Guide is the go-to reference for FPA members. It keeps preppers “on course” so that individual efforts align with the alliance’s overall doctrine and strategy.
