Q1: What is the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA)?
A: The Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) is a grassroots network of people dedicated to emergency preparedness. It empowers preppers nationwide to share knowledge, pool resources, and support each other in disasters. FPA is not a top-down organization but a community-driven alliance – members volunteer their time and skills to help others get ready. The emphasis is on a fair, ethical approach to prepping, avoiding selfish “lone wolf” mentalities. Members collaborate on practical readiness plans for anything from local storms to major crises. FPA provides guidance and tools (like the [[Compass Guide]]) to help even beginners start preparing effectively. In short, it’s an open network where anyone committed to preparedness can learn, connect, and become more self-reliant together. [#Beginner] [#Governance]
