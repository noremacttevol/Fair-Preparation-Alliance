**What’s already implemented (current wins):** We’ve established a **weekly Outernet broadcast schedule**. Every Sunday 1700 hours UTC, a 1-hour FPA broadcast goes out: it includes a news bulletin (compiled by the Intel team), a skill segment (recent topics: water purification basics, first-aid kit checklist), and member stories (we’ve aired interviews with members who dealt with real disasters and their lessons learned). Technically, we have set up **regional relay stations** – volunteer HAM operators who receive the HF transmission and re-broadcast on local repeaters or low-power FM. Wins so far: we’ve achieved coverage to reach members in 30+ states via at least one means (HAM, GMRS, or local FM). During a recent internet outage in a mountain community, those with just a crank radio could still hear the FPA update because one of our Outernet volunteers broadcast over FM there – this potentially aided not just members but anyone tuning in, providing reassurance and practical tips. The local podcast aspect is taking hold: chapters like the Pacific Northwest have started producing a 10-minute weekly local segment (they call it “Prepper Pacific Radio Hour”) that gets included in the loop. These local loops feature community-specific news (like an upcoming meetup or a local hazard watch) and then get shared around (so other regions can learn from them too). Another win: content creation by members has skyrocketed. Folks who have knowledge but aren’t writers found their voice
