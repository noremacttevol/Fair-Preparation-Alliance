**Access:** Every FPA squad is provided with an offline copy of the SHTF Bible:  
- **Digital:** Within the FPA App, the entire knowledge base is stored locally on members’ devices (it’s large, but we prioritize text and low-size graphics; high-res videos are optional). This means even if internet and power are down, if your phone or tablet has battery, you can search the SHTF library. The integrated AI assistant (Chapter 9) is trained on this content, allowing members to query it in natural language (e.g., ask “How do I splint a broken arm?” and get the summarized answer drawn from the Bible).  
- **Physical:** Many squads assemble physical binders or printouts of the most critical sections. FPA provides a printable PDF of the core SHTF Bible. Some veteran members have gone so far as to laminate pages or vacuum-seal a copy for durability. The idea is to have a hardcopy available in case digital devices fail or EMP (electromagnetic pulse) concerns—this might seem extreme, but part of Mk1Mod3 thinking is _redundancy_, so we embrace multiple formats.  
- **Updates:** The knowledge base is updated continuously as we learn new things or refine practices. Members can download updates when they have connectivity. Also, FPA periodically releases compiled new editions (e.g., an “Mk1Mod3 Edition” of the SHTF Bible that includes all the latest materials). Physical binder users are encouraged to swap in updated pages (we highlight what’s changed).
