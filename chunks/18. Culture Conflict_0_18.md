Compass Guide (Values & Mission): The Compass Guide outlines the Alliance’s fundamental values and mission objectives – it is the North Star for all decision-making. In conflict resolution, the Compass Guide is used as a reference point to find common ground. We ask: Which outcome here best upholds our core values? How can both parties reconnect with our shared mission? Often, conflicts narrow our vision to “me vs. you,” but the Compass reminds us of the bigger “us.” For instance, if there is a conflict about resource allocation between two projects, the discussion would be framed by our mission priorities: which approach advances our mission more effectively or is more aligned with our values of fairness and impact? By returning to first principles in heated moments, we defuse personal ego and make the resolution about reinforcing our collective purpose. This also ensures cultural resilience – our culture can bend in adaptation (finding new solutions) without breaking from our core principles, because those are non-negotiable anchors.
