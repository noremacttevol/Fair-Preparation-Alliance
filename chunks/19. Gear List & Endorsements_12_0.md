_This appendix provides the tools and templates members use during the gear evaluation process, as referenced in the doctrine._  
**Gear Audit Field Test Checklist:** (To be completed by members or squads when testing a piece of gear. This ensures consistency in evaluations.)  
- _Item Identification:_ Record the exact product name, model number, version, and any serial or batch number (if available). Note the source of the unit (purchased retail, provided by vendor, borrowed, etc.).  
- _Physical Inspection:_ Document initial observations out of the box. Build quality (materials, sturdiness), completeness of parts, and any noticeable defects. Take photos of the item from multiple angles and of any notable features or flaws.  
- _Specifications Verification:_ List the manufacturer’s claimed specifications (e.g., output power, battery life, capacity, weight). Wherever possible, measure or verify these claims. (Use tools like a scale for weight, multimeter for electrical output, stopwatch for runtime, etc.) Tick off which specs hold true and note discrepancies.  
- _Functional Tests:_ Use the gear in conditions simulating real use. Break this down into relevant tests, for example:  
- **Stress Test:** Push the item to its advertised limits. (If it’s a water filter rated for 1000 liters, filter a large volume of water or use until clogging to see performance; if it’s a radio, play it continuously to test battery life.)
