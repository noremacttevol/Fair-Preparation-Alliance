**Lessons Learned:** Before the registry, our knowledge of squads was informal – relying on memory and ad hoc spreadsheets. That led to embarrassing lapses, like two adjacent squads not knowing about each other during a regional flood in 2024, each thinking they were alone. The aftermath report made it clear: we needed a one-stop reference. We learned to balance detail with privacy – the first attempt listed personal phone numbers and got pushback; we revised to list role-based contacts or radio call signs instead. Also, keeping it current was a challenge; we discovered the registry is only as good as its updates, so we instituted a quarterly “roll call” for squads to confirm or update their info. Transparency and trust improved when squads could see this wasn’t a top-down control list, but a tool for all of us to help each other.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Determine what information is necessary and acceptable to include. Likely fields: Squad Name/ID, City/Area covered, Number of active members, Primary contact (name + callsign or email), Secondary contact, Special skills/equipment (e.g., "medical team", "4x4 vehicles", "water purification unit"), and any affiliations (if a squad is tightly linked with a church or CERT team, etc.). Avoid sensitive personal data – keep it professional and relevant.
