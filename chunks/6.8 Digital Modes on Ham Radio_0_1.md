they ensure that even if voice comms are intelligible, data can still get through under tough conditions (digital modes like FT8 can send messages with signals so weak you can barely detect them by ear). FPA trains interested members in using these programs, as they often require learning software and protocols. During drills, they might have one team send a hidden message via JS8Call that another team across the state must receive and decode, simulating internet outage. By integrating ham radio digital comms, FPA adds yet another layer of resilience: a way to transmit written information (lists of needs, detailed instructions, etc.) where voice might be too slow or unreliable, effectively bridging the gap between analog radio and modern data transfer in emergencies.
