- **Safety & Security:** Squads follow their COMPASS SOP. After initial sheltering (Command/Communicate steps done, everyone accounted for), they Observe: some smell gas in an area, another hears about someone trapped by debris. Mitigate/Mobilize: those who can do so safely start taking action even amid the storm (e.g., shutting off a gas line at a meter, or freeing a person stuck in a car). Squad Security Leads coordinate via radio to do periodic neighborhood watch – discouraging looters or vandals despite the chaos (FPA armbands and flashlights patrolling send a message that this community is organized). They do this carefully, in pairs, during the calmer eye of the storm if possible.  
- **Mutual Aid Underway:** One squad’s Medic guides another squad by radio on how to stabilize an injured neighbor’s broken arm until morning. Meanwhile, a squad with a working generator invites a couple of nearby households (FPA or not) to charge phones and get a warm drink – the Trust Doctrine of helping others remains strong even as the hurricane rages. People are scared, but hearing that calm FPA voice on the radio or having a neighbor check in reduces panic. It’s that culture of community care in real time.
