Q44: How can I cook or boil water if the power goes out?
A: Cooking without electricity is doable – you just need the right tools and some safety precautions. A propane or butane camping stove is excellent (always use it outdoors or with good ventilation, since it produces carbon monoxide). A backyard grill (charcoal or gas) also works well when the power is out – just never use a grill indoors. Indoors, you can use canned heat like Sterno (with a window open) to warm up simple meals. If you have a gas kitchen stove, you may be able to light the burners with a match even if the electric ignition is out. It’s also smart to stock some no-cook foods (canned goods, peanut butter, etc.) as backup. The main point: have a manual cooking method ready, and be very careful about fire safety and ventilation when using any flame or heat source. [#Beginner] [#Preparedness]
