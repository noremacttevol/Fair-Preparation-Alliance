- **Resource & Gear Standardization:** Phase1 also kicks off the Alliance’s **Approved Gear List** and tiered equipment system. We publish the gear list in tiers so new members can **prioritize essentials first**. For example, **Tier1 gear** covers immediate survival basics (water filtration, first-aid kit, flashlight/headlamp, fire starter, multi-tool, etc.). **Tier2 gear** adds extended survival items (long-term food storage, advanced medical supplies, generators or solar chargers, etc.). **Tier3 gear** gets into specialized equipment (HAM radios and antennas for long-range comms, ballistic protection, power tools for fortification, etc.). By phasing gear this way, no one gets overwhelmed, and every member quickly reaches a baseline of preparedness. Squad leaders conduct gear inspections and help members fill gaps. We leave nothing to chance – if it’s on the list, you secure it or your team finds a way to cover you.  
- **Operational Discipline:** Even in this manual phase, we run things with military-like efficiency. Clear **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** are issued for common tasks: how to respond to an alert, how to secure a water source, how to perform a squad check-in. Everyone is expected to **know the drills** and execute without hand-holding. This builds muscle memory and confidence. We’re blunt about it: **practice now or bleed later**. Phase1 is where we harden our habits.
