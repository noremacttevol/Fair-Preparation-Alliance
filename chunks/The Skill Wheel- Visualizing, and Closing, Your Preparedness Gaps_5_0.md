1. **Start with Test-My-Plan.** Your questionnaire score auto-plots on the Wheel, flagging any slice under 40 %. (Red Cross Ready Rating saw a 72 % rise in completed actions after adding a similar scored report.) ([American Red Cross Ready Rating Program](https://www.readyrating.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "American Red Cross Ready Rating Program – Ready Rating Program"))  
2. **Assign a micro-drill.** If “Comms” is low, you get the _Realnet Check-In_ drill; if “Medical” lags, you get the 10-minute _Stop-the-Bleed_ refresher. Drills map to NIOSH’s Eight Core Competencies for emergency work ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/research-programs/portfolio/ssrw.html "Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program | Research Programs | CDC")).  
3. **Log the drill.** A Pulse Test entry moves that slice outward one ring—instant dopamine. Visual progress drives habit formation, mirroring findings from competency-matrix studies in disaster nursing and volunteer training ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1321535/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Examining the effectiveness of a training program on improving ..."), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10848510/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The implementation of disaster preparedness training integration ...")).
