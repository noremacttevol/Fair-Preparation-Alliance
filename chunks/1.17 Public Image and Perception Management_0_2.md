collectively have – only that they have training and plans. In terms of branding, FPA doesn’t have big logos or uniforms in Phase 1 or 2. By Phase 3, when Outernet is active, they might have a subtle brand, but the narrative will be that FPA/Outernet is a network of volunteers helping to rebuild, share knowledge, and connect people – a positive force amid chaos. The Alliance’s emphasis on fairness also means they distance themselves from any group that appears to hoard or profiteer from disaster; FPA’s messaging might contrast “fair preparation” with unscrupulous practices in a tactful way. All these efforts in managing public perception aim to ensure that when people hear of FPA (or encounter its members), they come away with trust and respect rather than fear or skepticism. A good reputation also makes it easier post-disaster to collaborate with officials or assist non-members without resistance, fulfilling FPA’s humane objectives. (Cross-ref: [[External Partnerships and Outreach Policy]] for how they engage publicly, and [[FPA vs Traditional Prepping Approaches]] which highlights how FPA’s cooperative image differs from stereotypes.)
