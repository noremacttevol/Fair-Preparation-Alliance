Alliance Charter & Policies: The Governance team drafts and updates the Alliance’s Charter, Bylaws, and Policies – essentially our constitution. This defines how decisions are made, how leaders are chosen, the rights and responsibilities of members, and the code of conduct we all follow. For example, the rules of the dynamic pricing model (when to cap dues, how a vote-to-zero works, etc.) are formally codified by this team. They also establish membership standards: e.g., zero tolerance for theft or harassment within the Alliance, prohibitions on violence against innocents, non-discrimination policies, etc. Governance regularly reviews these governing documents, especially after major phase changes or incidents, to see if any rules need adjustment. They often seek member input on big changes (we’re participatory, after all), then finalize and enforce updates. Essentially, they keep our foundational rules up-to-date and reflective of our mission. (Many of these governance documents and principles were inspired by our founding vision – see [[Why FPA Mk1Mod2 Public]] for some foundational values that carry into Mk1Mod3.)
