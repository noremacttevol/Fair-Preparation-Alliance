8. **Practice a personal emergency drill:** Plan and execute a simple drill at home. For instance, one evening simulate a **power outage**: turn off your mains power and see how you cope for 8-12 hours. Use your flashlight, cook a meal with your backup stove or eat stored food, test your generator or battery bank if you have one, and practice communication (call or radio a fellow member to report your status). Alternatively, do a **bug-out drill**: pick a scenario (chemical spill, etc.), actually grab your family and bug-out bags, and drive to your designated bug-out location, or at least go through the motions of packing the car and discussing the route. The goal is to reveal holes in your plan. After the drill, make note of any problems (e.g. “my flashlight batteries were dead,” “we took too long to gather things,” “I realized I had no plan for the dog”). Share these findings with your squad so others learn too. This kind of personal drill is _expected within your first 2-3 months_ of joining. It proves that you’re not just accumulating gear – you’re training yourself to use it. Plus, it often motivates you to fix shortcomings immediately (nothing like sitting in the dark to remind you to buy extra batteries).
