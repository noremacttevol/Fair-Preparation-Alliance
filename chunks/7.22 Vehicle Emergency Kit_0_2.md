- Fuel and fluids: if safe/legal, maybe a jerry can of fuel (or at least an empty one to fetch fuel) and a siphon pump. In cold climates, a small can of de-icer or starting fluid.
FPAâ€™s guidance also covers maintenance: checking the kit regularly, rotating food/water, making sure nothing got used and not replaced (like that one time you gave someone a jump, are your cables back in place?). They encourage fueling up often (not letting tank drop below half) to extend range if evacuation hits. For multi-vehicle families, each car gets a kit plus tailored items (if one is the designated evacuation vehicle, maybe extra roof rack with storage, etc.). By prepping cars, the Alliance ensures members can handle roadside issues and evacuations more smoothly. Vehicles often serve as both transport and temporary shelter, so a well-prepared car can be the difference between an inconvenience and a life-threatening ordeal on the road.
