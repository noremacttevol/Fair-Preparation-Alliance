Q7: What kind of emergencies does FPA prepare for? All disasters?
A: FPA advocates preparing for a broad range of emergencies – from everyday incidents to worst-case disasters. This includes natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes that could strike your region. It also covers man-made crises: extended power grid failures, economic depressions, cyber-attacks, civil unrest, or even terrorism. Public health emergencies are on the list too (think pandemics or outbreaks). In short, FPA’s approach is “all-hazards” – members aim to be ready for anything life throws at them, big or small. Whether it’s a weeklong power outage or a nationwide crisis, the goal is to have plans and supplies in place. By preparing for a spectrum of scenarios, FPA members improve their resilience no matter what the emergency. [#Beginner] [#Preparedness]
