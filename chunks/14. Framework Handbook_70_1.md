- **Member Drills and Simulation:** Draft SOPs were tested in simulations. We ran tabletop exercises (talking through scenarios step by step) and live drills with volunteer squads to see if the SOP made sense operationally. These practice runs often revealed tweaks – maybe a step was out of order, or terminology was confusing. We iterated until each SOP was smooth and logical when enacted.  
- **Standardization and Terminology:** Part of this process was ensuring **canonical terminology** was used. Mk1Mod3 SOPs use the new standard terms (e.g., “squad” instead of legacy terms like “team” or “cell”) uniformly, to avoid confusion. Clear definitions are provided for any acronyms or codes. This way, when squads from different regions are working together, an instruction like “Activate a Level 2 response” or “Initiate COMPASS protocol” means the same thing to everyone.
