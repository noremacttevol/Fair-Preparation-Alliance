All these integrations will be documented in the Mk1Mod3 Master Plan (see the overall [[Compass Guide]]) to ensure everything stays coherent. From a member’s perspective, the goal is for the FPA ecosystem to feel like _one unified system_. For example: a member reads about a technique in the SHTF Bible, they then practice it in a _Test My Plan_ drill, that success updates their Skill Wheel, which in turn brings them closer to their next rank – and along each step, the app and materials are guiding them and reflecting their progress. It should feel seamless and supportive, with each component (content, practice, evaluation, recognition) reinforcing the others.
