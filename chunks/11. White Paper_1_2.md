**Accessibility and Fairness:** A core tenet of FPA is that preparedness shouldn’t be a luxury. This roadmap emphasizes **low-cost or free solutions** so that low-income members can participate fully. (Research shows cost is a major barrier – lower-income households take fewer high-cost preparedness actions but will take just as many low/no-cost steps if given the chance ([Are Americans Prepared for Disasters? FEMA’s Survey Reveals Key Findings - Risk and Resilience Hub](https://www.riskandresiliencehub.com/are-americans-prepared-for-disasters-femas-survey-reveals-key-findings/#:~:text=5,disadvantaged)).) Throughout the plan, wherever expensive gear or training might be mentioned, we include cheaper alternatives or free resources. For example, we point members to free Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) courses or DIY projects instead of pushing fancy equipment. The goal is to close the preparedness gap by **democratizing survival skills**. No member should feel excluded due to finances; resourcefulness and commitment matter more than money in FPA’s approach.
