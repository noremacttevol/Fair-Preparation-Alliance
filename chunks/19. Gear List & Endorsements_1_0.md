In the world of preparedness, too many families and communities have been sold gear based on flashy marketing or fear-driven hype. Overpriced “must-have” gadgets often fail when they’re needed most, and critical tools sometimes sit untested until an emergency strikes. The Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) was founded to change this. We are a grassroots network of preppers nationwide, united to **weaponize truth** in evaluating gear and to drive **fairness** into the survival supply chain. This doctrine lays out how we, as an alliance, verify and endorse gear based on facts and field performance – not advertising. It is written in plain language for all to understand our mission and in serious detail for our members to enforce it.  
**Why This Doctrine Matters:** Every household deserves field-tested, off-grid-capable tools they can rely on. By formally documenting our gear endorsement process, we commit to a transparent system that **crushes hype-based pricing** and rewards honest quality. Vendors will know that only truth-verified equipment earns our mark. Members will know their time and trust are valued. And the public will see an ethical standard that puts readiness before profit. This charter is both an internal guide for FPA members and a public promise of how we operate. It is intended to be ratified by our membership and enforced as Alliance policy, standing alongside our Trust Doctrine and Offline Resilience System guidelines as a foundation of the FPA.
