**Roadmap Structure:** The plan is divided into **Phase1: Individual Preparedness**, **Phase2: Local Squad Formation**, and **Phase3: National/Global Network**. Each phase builds on the previous, scaling from personal readiness to community teams to a federated network that can operate nationally (and eventually globally). In each phase overview, we summarize goals, then list specific milestones (with numbering like _Phase X.Y_ for easy reference). For each milestone, we provide real-world examples or plausible scenarios illustrating it in action, **lessons learned** from past drills or disasters, a checklist of **Action Steps** (with low-cost options highlighted), and a **Contingency Plan** addressing what to do if things go wrong. This structure ensures that at every level – from a single parent preparing their home, to a neighborhood volunteer squad, to the entire alliance – we maintain aggressive realism, decentralization over central control, transparency over bureaucracy, and member empowerment over admin control.
