- **Contingency:** If radio comms are severely degraded (due to interference, EMP damage, etc.), use an entirely different technology. For instance, deploy a field **runner system** – e.g., every squad sends a runner to a central known meeting point (maybe a safe hill or landmark) at 0700 and 1900 each day to exchange written notes with other squads or any present coordinator. Or use whistle signals or community bulletin boards as low-tech comm. Another contingency could be using car teams as mobile communication relays (drive to a location where radio contact can be made, then ferry messages physically to another cluster).  
- **Emergency:** Worst-case, when immediate communication is impossible or too dangerous, we rely on pre-established _actions/triggers_. This is “communication by plan.” For example, “If no contact can be made with HQ for 72 hours after an event, all squads execute Plan Bravo autonomously” – meaning everyone has a copy of Plan Bravo (perhaps a set of objectives or movements) and will follow it without needing to talk. Essentially, the plan itself is the communication, decided in advance. Another emergency measure is broadcasting blind on likely channels in hope someone hears (last resort), or using public radio if available (e.g., someone from the Alliance might break into a local FM station broadcast with vital instructions – extreme but in emergency).
