- **Power Module:** A rugged, rechargeable battery pack (preferably LiFePO4 for stability and cycle life, ~20–50Ah capacity) paired with a compact **solar panel array** (foldable panels totaling ~50-100W) and a charge controller. This module includes DC output adapters (cigarette lighter sockets, USB ports, and DC barrel connectors) to run or charge devices directly. Some designs also incorporate a hand-crank or pedal generator as backup for night or cloudy conditions. The power module is the heart of the unit – it lets us charge radios, run LEDs, or power an emergency mesh node day after day. It should be EMP-hardened to the extent possible (spare controller and critical spares in Faraday bag). All wiring in this module uses standard 12V DC distribution with fuses, so any FPA vehicle or battery can integrate with it if needed. Simplicity and durability are crucial – analog charge meters, not just digital, so we can gauge status even if some electronics fail.
