Elections & Leadership Accountability: Governance & Oversight administers any elections within FPA and keeps leadership accountable to the members. Some leadership positions (especially regional council members or certain committee heads) may be elected by the membership. Governance sets up and oversees these elections – establishing secure voting systems (with Tech’s help), verifying one-member-one-vote (or whatever weighting is decided), and ensuring fairness. They might implement term limits or rotation policies to prevent a stagnant leadership class. This team also handles recall votes or impeachment procedures if a leader needs to be removed by the members. Additionally, Governance runs internal tribunals or review boards if serious disputes or misconduct allegations arise that aren’t clear-cut legal matters – a fair process to hear all sides and make a decision, subject to the rules in the Charter.
