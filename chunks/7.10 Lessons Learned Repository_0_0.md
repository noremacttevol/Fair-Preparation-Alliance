Every event and exercise is a learning opportunity, and FPA formalizes this by maintaining a Lessons Learned repository. After an incident (be it a planned drill, a real emergency that members responded to, or even just an interesting situation one member experienced), the Alliance conducts a debrief and captures key takeaways. These takeaways are written as brief notes or reports: what happened, what went well, what problems arose, and most importantly, what changes or action items are recommended. The repository is essentially a timeline of wisdom: e.g., “2024-08-15 Heatwave – Lesson: Our cooling center plan lacked backup power, remedy by acquiring more generators.” Each lesson entry in the Knowledge Vault might link to relevant topical notes (like that generator lesson links to the note on [[7.30 Power & Charging]] gear or [[6.11 DIY Device Fabrication]] for making swamp coolers). This integration ensures the lessons don’t just sit in isolation but actively update the living documents. The repository is accessible to all members, promoting a culture of transparency and continuous improvement (as mentioned in [[3.19 Continuous Improvement]]). New members often review past lessons to get up to speed on why certain protocols exist (many rules are written in blood as the saying goes – created after learning from mistakes). Over time, patterns in the repository might highlight, say, repeat issues with communication, prompting a focused fix. It’s not only internal events; FPA
