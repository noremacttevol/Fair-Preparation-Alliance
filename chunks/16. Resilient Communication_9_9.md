Compass SOPs likely outline how to prioritize objectives: e.g., maybe “ensure the safety of innocents before securing assets.” In a communications context, that means our nets might have a priority schema: life-and-death calls override all others, etc. Everyone is taught that per Compass values, a call about a medical emergency has priority on the air over a call about needing more fuel. This aligns everyone’s use of the comm network with our value hierarchy.  
Additionally, Compass often refers to navigation through uncertainty – our comm doctrine acknowledges that by building in redundancy and drills, so that even when uncertain, people have a path to follow (like the fallback nets and triggers). It’s giving a compass for comms itself: e.g., “if lost, tune here at X time” is like a literal compass arrow pointing them somewhere.
