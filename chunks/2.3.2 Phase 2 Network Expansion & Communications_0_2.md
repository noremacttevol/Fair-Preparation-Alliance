eavesdroppers from identifying FPA locations or resources. Also, Phase 2 often sees growth by necessity – people in crisis seeking help. FPA has to decide how to handle non-member requests now under more dangerous conditions. Generally, they stick to aiding members first but may temporarily assist outsiders in dire need in a controlled way ([[Assisting Non-Members in Crisis]] guidelines apply) without revealing full involvement (for example, doing charity anonymously or under a “relief group” label). Phase 2 can be prolonged if society is in a slow collapse; FPA essentially becomes a parallel system keeping members alive and informed. Importantly, throughout Phase 2, the Alliance continuously updates situational awareness: members report local conditions (food shortages, violence, disease outbreaks) via the network, which leadership compiles to see the big picture – effectively building an intel mosaic better than official sources. This helps them make decisions like when/where to relocate assets or if certain areas remain safe. If pockets of stability remain (e.g., some grid power somewhere), they’ll leverage those to support others. Phase 2 is the crisis survival phase – FPA’s success here is measured by member safety and the network’s functionality. Once stability begins to return or if the crisis becomes protracted with FPA as a stable subsystem, the Alliance will prepare to transition to Phase 3. But Phase 2’s immediate objective is clear: preserve life, preserve
