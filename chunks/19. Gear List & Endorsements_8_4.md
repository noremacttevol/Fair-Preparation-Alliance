- **Offline Data Packs and Libraries:** The Alliance also curates **data packs** – essentially dumps of our critical knowledge, including the gear endorsements, manuals, and reference guides (like the SHTF Bible). These can be stored on offline mediums such as USB drives, SD cards, or even printed books. Some members use low-power e-ink readers or old laptops with the FPA library saved locally. The Gear List & Endorsements Doctrine itself, being a foundational document, is meant to be printable and stored in binders (as mentioned at the start). We envision every local squad having a physical binder (Mk1Mod3 binder edition) containing this doctrine, the Trust Doctrine, key procedures, and a collection of field cards and training materials – essentially a self-contained “Alliance Bible” for when online access isn’t possible. This redundancy ensures that our standards and knowledge persist through any disaster. Even if central servers or leadership are unreachable, the doctrine empowers members to continue the mission independently, because they have the rules and processes on hand to keep endorsing and monitoring gear at the local level.
