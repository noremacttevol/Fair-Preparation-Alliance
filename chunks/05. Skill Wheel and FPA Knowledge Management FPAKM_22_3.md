- **SHTF Bible:** The _SHTF Bible_ is FPA’s extensive survival manual and knowledge base. Integration here is straightforward: the Skill Wheel points _to_ the content you should study, and the content can point _back_ to the Skill Wheel progress. We’ve already mentioned how each skill category corresponds to one or more chapters in the Bible. The Knowledge Management System maintains a mapping of wheel segments to those chapters or sections. In the app, if you notice a low score in a segment, there may be a “Learn” or “Study” button that jumps you to the relevant SHTF Bible material. Conversely, as you go through the digital SHTF Bible, you might encounter quizzes or “mark as completed” boxes that, when checked, feed into your Skill Wheel data. Another aspect is keeping them updated in tandem: as the SHTF Bible is updated over time (it’s a living document, updated with new best practices), we’ll update the Skill Wheel’s criteria accordingly. For example, if the SHTF Bible adds a new chapter on _cybersecurity preparedness_, we might add new objectives under the relevant category (or even add a new category if needed) so that members can get credit for learning that material. The end result is that the **knowledge base and the Skill Wheel stay synchronized** – one provides the information and the other measures the absorption of that information.
