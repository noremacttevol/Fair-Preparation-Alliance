**Trust and Leadership Benefits:** Beyond points, there are qualitative benefits. Members known to have strong comms and power setups are more likely to be tapped for leadership positions such as comms officer in a response, or quartermaster roles. In an outage scenario, these are the folks who might host a local rally point (since they can generate power and coordinate comms). Therefore, as part of our **Trust Doctrine integration**, a member who has proven their capabilities in this domain is accorded higher trust – for instance, their situational reports in a disaster will be given more weight because we know they have the equipment and training to be accurate. They might also be entrusted with sensitive information (like secure frequency lists or cipher keys for encoded communications) that we wouldn’t give a less-prepared member. All of this creates a culture where members **strive to excel in comm readiness**, not just for personal safety but for community standing and responsibility.
