authoritarian; it serves the members by providing support, not by issuing top-down orders. In practice, the national team often facilitates knowledge-sharing (like distributing the combined [[“Whole Book” Master Documentation]] or updates to the [[SHTF Bible]]), organizes nationwide training events or communications drills, and spearheads innovations (like rolling out the [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] infrastructure). This structure is designed so that if one leader is incapacitated or unreachable, others can fill the role ([[Continuity of Leadership]]), keeping the Alliance functional under stress. (See also: [[Member Participation in Governance]] for how members influence national decisions, and [[Plan Updates and Versioning]] for how leadership handles evolving strategy.)
