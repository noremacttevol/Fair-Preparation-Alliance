**Historic Surges & Strategic Importance:** To underscore the importance, consider how HAM usage spikes during crises: Katrina saw a nationwide rally of operators as described; similarly, after recent hurricanes (Maria in 2017 in Puerto Rico, for example), amateur radio operators were airlifted in to re-establish island-wide comms when government systems failed. During the Japan 2011 earthquake/tsunami and the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes, amateur radio provided essential emergency messaging when cell networks were overloaded. Even during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns (not an infrastructure failure but social), HAM radio experienced a surge in on-air activity as operators stepped up to share information and health and welfare traffic when normal channels were saturated or unreliable. The patterns are clear: **when crisis hits, HAM radio usage isn’t a luxury – it explodes into a crucial service.** The FPA will be part of that service, not as bystanders but as trained communicators ensuring our own survival and aiding others.
