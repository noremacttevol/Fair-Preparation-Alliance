- **Compass SOPs (Strategic Guidance & Decision Making):** The Compass SOPs is our guide for making decisions when situations are complex and dynamic – essentially our playbook for ethical and strategic choices (the moral compass and tactical compass). Communication is the medium through which those decisions get executed. This doctrine ensures that when the Compass says “preserve life and morale” or “maintain covertness until trust is established,” our comms practices support that. For instance, Compass might dictate that we avoid broadcasting our location openly to unknown parties – so our comms doctrine includes using codes or indirect references to locations when on open channels (“We’re at Grid Point Alpha” instead of “We’re at 5th and Main”). If the Compass emphasizes leadership succession and decentralization under certain conditions, our comms signals and fallback leadership protocols directly enable that (we described how leadership would signal or how squads autonomously operate guided by pre-set plans from the Compass).
