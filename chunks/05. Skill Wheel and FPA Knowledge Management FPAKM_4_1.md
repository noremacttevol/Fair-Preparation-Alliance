**Scoring:** Within each category, a member’s percentage is determined by their progress in completing those defined sub-skills and objectives. In early phases, scoring will be a manual or semi-automatic process – for example, instructors or admins will input when a member completes a given requirement. By Phase3, scoring becomes more automated and data-driven (with the AI verifying quiz results, checking logs of training drills, etc., as described later). Regardless of phase, **transparency in the scoring criteria** is critical for trust. Members should understand _what_ contributes to their score in each segment. To that end, we anticipate providing each member with a checklist or “skill journal” for every category. As they check off items (e.g. _“Complete CERT Basic Training”_ under First Aid, or _“Pass FPA Level1 Radio Comms quiz”_ under Communications), their percentage in that segment increases accordingly. The system will make it clear how much each accomplishment is “worth.”
