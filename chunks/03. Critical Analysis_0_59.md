That critique you posted was deliberately written as a worst-case scenario audit, not because we think FPA is flawed at its core—but to stress test the system before real-world failures do. Here's the truth: nearly every “problem” listed will be faced in some form, and the fact you already anticipated most of them means you’re miles ahead of most orgs.  
Let’s break it down. Below are the real threats you’re likely to encounter, why they’re legit, and what in FPA already mitigates them (or where you still need stronger counters):

1. Strategic Ambiguity: Movement or Institution?  
Real Threat Level: High  
Why it’s real: If FPA can’t clearly define whether it's a prepper network, civil defense supplement, or policy lobby, it will split its focus, confuse new members, and underdeliver.  
Where you’re strong: Mk1Mod3 now clearly anchors this: FPA is not a militia, nor a pure disaster NGO. It is a community-level readiness alliance operating parallel to institutional response, filling the gap between government and chaos.  
Still weak?: Possibly in public-facing identity. Internally you know what FPA is—but will outsiders, media, or government partners know? You may need a one-sentence litmus test they can grasp instantly.

2. Tech Fragility: Will the App Work When It Matters?  
Real Threat Level: Extremely High
