**Spreading the Doctrine (Teach-back):** One powerful method to solidify someone’s expertise is to have them teach others – the _“learn one, do one, teach one”_ philosophy. FPA leverages this: when someone steps up as an interpreter, we encourage (or require) them to host a session teaching a topic to newer members or the public. It could be as simple as leading a preparedness talk at the library, or as complex as running a local radio drill. When they teach, they truly become masters of the content, and they also start thinking in terms of how to frame information – essentially becoming outreach multipliers themselves. This cascades knowledge outward and identifies those with a knack for communication. Over time, our best interpreters often become regional coordinators or special envoys to help other squads get started – much like how seasoned revolutionaries were sent to spark cells elsewhere (to use a historical parallel).
