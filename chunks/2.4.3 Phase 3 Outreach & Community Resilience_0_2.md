FPA might engage in dialogues about building redundant systems permanently (influence local governance to adopt community prep plans, etc.), essentially advocating for fair preparation as a norm in the new society. The outreach in this phase is not about boasting FPA’s role but demonstrating it through positive action – by Phase 3, outsiders who benefited from FPA’s broadcasts or aid will naturally see the value of what the Alliance stands for. Phase 3, in summary, is where FPA’s long-term vision materializes: the Alliance not only survives the catastrophe but helps shape a fair, cooperative recovery, thereby fulfilling its mission of a prepared society.
