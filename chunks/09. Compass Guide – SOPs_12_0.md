Every SOP indexed here is subject to [[Trust Firewall System]]. That means:  
- Edits require rank-suitable signoff (E7+ or officer depending on scope)
- Live drills must be logged with a "Trust Witness" if SOP revision follows a field incident
- Compass Guide patches must be versioned and timestamped on the [[TERM:Quick Sync SOP]]  
Failure to observe trust calibration invalidates the SOP’s live status. Only TMP-aligned documents are reflected in squad briefings or Sync-reliant dashboards.  
> Compass Guide entries are not philosophical—they define actual operational behavior under live deployment conditions.
