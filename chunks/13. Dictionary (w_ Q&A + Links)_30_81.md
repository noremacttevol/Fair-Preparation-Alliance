Importantly, they avoid a pity approach; instead it’s “everyone has something to contribute, and everyone needs a plan.” If a member is deaf, for instance, group comms will adjust (using visual signals). If someone can’t walk, caches might be configured so supplies come to them or they have a mobile scooter with extra battery. By integrating these considerations into planning, FPA ensures no member is left behind due to physical limitations – it’s a team effort to cover each other. [#Intermediate] [#Community]
