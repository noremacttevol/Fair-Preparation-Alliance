Each core category in the Skill Wheel is underpinned by a defined set of **skills and learning objectives** (outlined in internal FPA training manuals and in the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]). Defining these sub-skills and criteria is crucial so that percentages on the wheel are meaningful and standardized across the organization. For example, the **First Aid** category might consist of sub-skills like completing a basic first aid course, earning a CPR/AED certification, finishing a Stop-the-Bleed training, attaining Wilderness First Responder training, etc. The **Communications** category might include operating an FRS/GMRS radio, obtaining an amateur HAM radio license, knowing emergency frequencies and protocols, and so on. Similar detailed breakdowns exist for each category. These lists of requirements will be compiled from existing FPA curricula and resources (cross-referenced with the _[[SHTF Bible]]_ content and relevant SOPs) to ensure consistency between what is taught and what is measured.
