**AP Progression and Slope:** Each rank has an increasing AP requirement. Generally, **each successive rank demands more AP than the last**, reflecting the greater effort and contribution needed as one rises. The table later in this document details the AP “floor” for each rank and an “AP slope” value indicating how much more AP is needed compared to the previous rank. In early ranks the increases are modest, but by higher ranks the AP gaps grow larger – ensuring that senior ranks represent significantly greater cumulative contribution. This progression can be visualized as a slope that gets steeper at higher levels (meaning it takes more effort to climb from one rank to the next as you ascend).
