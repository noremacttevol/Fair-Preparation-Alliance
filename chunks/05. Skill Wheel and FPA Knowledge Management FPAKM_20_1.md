- **Squad Dashboards (Part of [[Squad Tools]]):** We will develop leadership views so that squad leaders, regional coordinators, etc., can see the Skill Wheels of their team members at a glance. This might be presented as a roster with mini-wheel icons next to each name, or a summary table of percentages. These **Squad Tools** will be invaluable for planning and preparedness management. For example, a squad leader preparing for hurricane season could quickly identify which squad members have strong Medical or Comms skills and which might need extra training, helping assign roles or buddy pairs accordingly.  
- **Integration with Test My Plan:** By this phase, we aim to have the [[Test My Plan]] simulation tool feeding data into the Skill Wheel system. Concretely, this means if the _Test My Plan_ analysis flags a deficiency in someone’s plan due to a skill gap, the system can reflect that. For example, if a member’s personal plan review indicates they didn’t include an alternate communications method, the system might flag their Comms segment for review or subtly reduce their effective Comms score until the issue is addressed. Conversely, if a member aces a rigorous plan simulation, the system could give a confidence boost or at least mark that their plan is verified. We’ll tread carefully here to keep it fair and not punitive, but the integration ensures the wheel isn’t isolated from practical planning efforts.
