**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** In the next month, we’ll focus on **expansion and integration**. Planned steps: (a) Roll out the **Offline Pocket Guide** – a downloadable, periodically updated offline snapshot of the Knowledge Base for members to keep on their devices (critical for grid-down scenarios). (b) Host a “Knowledge Jam” event where members collectively draft new SOPs for identified gaps (like pandemic preparedness, which is timely). (c) Integrate the Dictionary definitions pop-up into the FPA App and forums – hovering a term like “OPSEC” will show the FPA definition, improving on-the-fly understanding. We’ll also implement a **versioning system** for SOPs (to track changes and ensure field teams know if they’re using the latest version). Within 30 days, expect 20 new terms and 5 new SOPs to be added through community input. This living document approach will remain agile. _As one knowledge management guide notes, a living knowledge base develops organically through normal processes (team input) rather than top-down effort ([Articles - How To Build A Living Knowledge Base](https://www.pbworks.com/knowledge-base/#:~:text=The%20answer%20to%20this%20challenge,is%20that%20the%20knowledge%20base) ) – we are seeing that happen in real time._
