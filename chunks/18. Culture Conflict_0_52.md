Step 2: Collective Issue Gathering and Prioritization – At the beginning of a reflection forum, the first task is to share the collected feedback and identify key themes. For instance, perhaps multiple teams indicated that communication between circles is a problem, or many members cite a need for clearer decision-making processes. The facilitators (likely members of the Culture & Resilience Committee or an appointed “Reflection Taskforce”) present these themes to the assembly. The assembly then has an opportunity to prioritize which issues to discuss in depth, often via a simple vote or consensus. This step ensures the conversation focuses on what the collective finds most pressing. Even if some topics are sensitive (e.g., “There is a perception of favoritism in promotions” or “Our stated value of sustainability isn’t reflected in our operations”), bringing them into the open in a structured way prevents whisper networks and builds trust that leadership is willing to hear criticism. In some cases, specific conflict cases from the past year may be anonymized and presented as case studies, especially if they illustrate larger patterns (“We had three conflicts related to workload imbalance, indicating a systemic issue with how we allocate work.”).
