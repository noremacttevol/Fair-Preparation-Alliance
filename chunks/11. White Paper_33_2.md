- Ensure translation and accessibility: provide simultaneous interpretation for meetings as needed and circulate written proposals in multiple languages beforehand.
**Contingency Plan:** If some large chapters choose not to participate, keep the door open – demonstrate the council’s value through successful collaborations. Should international tensions arise (say governments frown on an ‘international alliance’), emphasize that each national FPA is independent and participation is about humanitarian aid, not politics. If travel or tech issues hinder meetings, use asynchronous methods (shared documents, radio relays of meeting minutes over Outernet). The council should never become a single point of failure – if it’s unable to convene, bilateral or small group collaborations can fill the gap until full meetings resume. Essentially, the alliance can function even if formal council processes temporarily pause.
