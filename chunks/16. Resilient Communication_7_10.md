- **Integration with Public Emergency Comms:** Some training covers interfacing with external emergency networks. For instance, how to communicate with local law enforcement or FEMA teams if they’re operating on open channels, or how to properly word a message that might be relayed into official channels. This is important because Phase 3 leaders might be those who liaise or at least monitor government/military broadcasts and need to know proper etiquette and filtering (what to share, what not to, to protect Alliance members’ privacy or security).  
- **Testing and Certification:** To advance from Phase 3, members likely undergo a rigorous evaluation – maybe a capstone exercise. For example, a weekend-long simulation where they are given the role of Communications Officer for a region after a catastrophe. The exercise would throw multiple challenges at them: loss of contact with one team, an overload of incoming distress calls, conflicting reports that need verification, etc. How they manage this (with perhaps only a small staff or alone) is graded. They must show they can keep a cool head, keep information organized (like maintaining a situation map or log), and make sound decisions such as when to switch frequencies or when to invoke emergency protocols. They also need to prove they can train Phase 1 and 2 folks – part of Phase 3 maturity is being a teacher to the less experienced.
