**Why it was created (problem it solves):** FPA recognized early that information is power – but only if it’s accessible and up-to-date. Preppers often rely on scattered sources or old books; misinformation or outdated techniques can be dangerous. We needed a **single source of truth** where members can get reliable answers and share proven methods. This living knowledge base solves the problems of **fragmented knowledge and inconsistent practices**. It ensures everyone speaks the same language (via the Dictionary) and follows vetted procedures (via SOPs). By being “living,” it addresses the issue of knowledge going stale – it’s continuously refined by our community’s experiences. _Such a living knowledge base evolves naturally with our Alliance’s needs, responding to genuine member questions as they emerge ([Help Doc Debt: 80% of Knowledge Bases are Out of Date | Brainfish](https://www.brainfishai.com/blog/help-doc-debt-knowledge-bases-are-out-of-date#:~:text=documented,without%20requiring%20constant%20human%20oversight))._
