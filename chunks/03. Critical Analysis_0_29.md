NATO’s AI Strategy: NATO, recognizing the role of AI in defense, adopted Principles of Responsible Use of AI that emphasize lawfulness, accountability, explainability, reliability, governability, and bias mitigation. These principles are meant to guide the use of AI in military contexts in line with democratic values and international law. For FPA, the specifics of international law may not apply, but the spirit certainly does. If FPA uses algorithms – say to prioritize which community needs help first or to allocate limited supplies – those decisions must be fair and explainable. Bias mitigation is especially relevant: data-driven tools might unintentionally favor communities that have more tech-savvy members (who report their status more frequently) or could underrepresent marginalized groups. Adopting a “responsible AI/tech use” policy within FPA would build credibility and prevent tech from undermining the fairness goal. NATO’s approach also highlights cooperation with private sector and academia to stay on the cutting edge, which FPA could emulate by forming an advisory board of data scientists or partnering with universities to develop its tools. Moreover, NATO’s emphasis on interoperability and standards in AI could translate to FPA championing open standards for things like disaster data or interoperable communication tools among preparedness organizations. In short, as FPA potentially integrates more technology, looking to frameworks like NATO’s can ensure that
