In summary, this doctrine _implements_ the gear list: telling members how to employ endorsed gear effectively (like how to set up that endorsed antenna for best range) and to prioritize acquiring the endorsed items that fill gaps (like if you don’t have an endorsed Faraday bag, get one). It also _relies_ on gear standardization: our instructions often assume a baseline of equipment that the endorsements ensure (like cables types, power connectors uniformity – many Alliance gear uses Anderson Powerpole connectors, for instance, a detail we push so any member can hook into any other’s battery easily). Those little standards matter in the field and are part of gear docs, but reinforced in use here.
