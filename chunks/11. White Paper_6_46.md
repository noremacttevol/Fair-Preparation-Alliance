18. **Milestone 18: Establish Liaison with Local Government (ICS Alignment)**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A squad leader in a small town took the initiative to meet the county emergency manager and police chief. She presented the FPA squad’s existence and training level. The officials were a bit wary at first, but she offered a liaison plan: during any incident, she (or her designated alternate) would report to the town’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) or Incident Command Post with a list of available squad resources and would relay official info back to her team. This closely mirrored the **Incident Command System (ICS)** principle of a Liaison Officer ([[PDF] INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM ICS POSITION: LIAISON OFFICER](http://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/f5559dd86dbe4a56dde8a871dcc9e775.pdf#:~:text=THE%20LIAISON%20OFFICER%27S%20FUNCTION%20IS,FROM%20ASSISTING%20AND%20COOPERATING%20AGENCIES)). Come the next flood, the squad liaison checked in with the EOC, plugged into the response, and was tasked with canvassing a neighborhood for survivors – effectively becoming an integrated auxiliary unit. The smooth coordination earned praise and now the local government treats the squad as a known partner.
