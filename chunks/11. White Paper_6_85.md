- _Lessons Learned:_ Memory is fallible, especially as members come and go. Writing things down is part of transparency and scalability. It allows others (within and outside your squad) to learn from your experience. Having your own mini “field guide” tailored to your community makes the response more consistent and less chaotic. **Lesson:** Make documentation a habit – after each drill or real event, note lessons and update procedures. Link them to the broader Compass Guide for reference (e.g., if the Compass Guide has a section on flood response, note how your local plan aligns or differs due to local specifics). This ensures Phase 2 deliverables feed into Phase 3’s knowledge base, and that you can seamlessly connect to improvements from Phase 1 templates and future Phase 3 reviews.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Designate a squad scribe or historian. This can rotate or be a shared responsibility, but someone should have the task of capturing decisions and outcomes in writing. Even meeting minutes and drill debrief notes are valuable.  
- Develop simple SOPs for recurring squad tasks: communications check, activation when X happens, setting up shelter, etc. Start with bullet points – they can be refined. You might use templates from the Compass Guide, then adjust for your neighborhood.
