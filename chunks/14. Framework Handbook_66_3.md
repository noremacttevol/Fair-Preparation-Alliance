In sum, the squad system provides FPA with a **modular and resilient organizational backbone**. Each squad is like a cell in a body â€“ capable on its own, but even more powerful when linked with others as part of a larger organism. By clearly defining roles and practicing together, FPA squads turn a collection of volunteers into a disciplined unit that can respond to crisis effectively and humanely.
