Our technology directly supports governance and the Trust Doctrine through built-in transparency and control features:  
- **Transparency Logs (Digital):** Every significant action that occurs in the system is recorded in an **append-only log** that members can inspect. For example:  
- When a squad completes a drill, a summary record (timestamp, participants, outcome, any incidents) is logged.  
- When a leader is appointed or steps down, that event is logged.  
- If the Compass Guide or SOPs are updated (patch issued), the old version is archived and the change is logged with who approved it.  
- AI model updates are logged (including what changed, in layman’s terms).  
- Moderation actions (AI or human) are logged, including content of concern (unless extremely sensitive). These logs are accessible through the app’s governance interface. They might be structured by category (e.g., “Drill Logs”, “Leadership Logs”, “System Change Logs”). Members can review them to understand what’s happening in the organization. We use cryptographic techniques to ensure logs cannot be tampered with unnoticed – each entry is digitally signed, and the logs might be backed by a blockchain or at least regularly published hash to members to verify integrity. The goal: **no secret decisions, no hidden changes**.
