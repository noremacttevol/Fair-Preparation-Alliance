- **Maintain an “old school” comms method:** In addition to HAM (from Phase1.1), consider easier two-way options for short range: FRS/GMRS walkie-talkies (no license needed for FRS, cheap at big-box stores) so you can talk to family or neighbors within a mile or two. Or CB radio (no license, mobile units ~$40) for local area comms and to potentially reach truckers or other CB users in an emergency. Make sure whatever you get, you test it. For example, give your neighbor one of your walkie-talkies and see if you can talk from home to home. Pre-agree on a channel to monitor in emergencies.  
- **Create a communications plan (COMMS SOP):** Write down important frequencies, channels, and contacts. This might include: your local HAM emergency net freq, FRS Channel 1 (or whatever for your neighborhood), the phone number of an out-of-state relative (for relaying messages), and even meeting times (“If all comms fail, we will rendezvous at X location at noon daily”). This should be part of your emergency plan document. Share this with your family and possibly your Phase2 squad once formed.
