Learning from Best Practices (Hybrid Model): As this analysis shows, FPA has the advantage of coming second – it can learn from what has and hasn’t worked in other systems worldwide. This means FPA can be built as a hybrid model, combining, for example, the community training of CERT, the mutual aid pacts of NATO, the ethos of LDS self-reliance, and the tech-savvy of modern data platforms. It’s easier to integrate these now than it was to develop them originally. This meta-strategy – picking the best elements – is a strength as long as FPA maintains coherence. Few organizations have the liberty to span across such domains; FPA’s fresh start allows it. In practice, this could result in unique offerings: perhaps FPA could establish something like a “Resilience Operations Center” that functions akin to a fusion of a 911 dispatch, a social network, and a logistics hub, accessible to members – a concept borrowed from various fields but never implemented for civilian mutual aid at scale. If successfully rolled out, such an innovation would set FPA apart and draw attention (and membership).
