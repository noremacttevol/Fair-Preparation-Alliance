- In conversations, pinpoint collaboration points: e.g., if the Red Cross sets up a shelter during disasters, maybe your squad can staff a table there to register local residents or do night watch. If a local restaurant has a big kitchen, maybe they could be the designated community kitchen during a prolonged outage (with squad members assisting).  
- Establish a liaison role in your squad (see Integration Protocols later) specifically to maintain these relationships. They should periodically check in with partners, share updates, and invite them to your drills or meetings occasionally.  
- Keep a contact directory of partner organizations – names, phone numbers, and roles. Also, exchange any emergency comms info (like “if cell fails, our squad will be on FRS channel 5, you can reach us through that” or similar). Essentially integrate them into your broader response plan where feasible.
