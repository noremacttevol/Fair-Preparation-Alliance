- **Tiered Information Products (Proposed):** In the future, FPA might offer compiled handbooks or digital apps as tiered products – for instance, a paid mobile app that contains an offline database of all endorsed gear with regular updates. This would be a way to spread our vetted information to a wider audience and potentially create a revenue stream to support the Alliance’s non-profit activities. We are cautious here: any such product must adhere to our ethics (information would be same as members get, perhaps delayed or limited for non-members, but paying for the app doesn’t get a say in content). The idea is to make a **public-friendly format** of our knowledge for those who may not (yet) be in the Alliance, while members would likely get it for free as part of their benefits. This is still in discussion stages and would be subject to member approval, especially to ensure it doesn’t de-incentivize joining or volunteering (the goal is to educate more people, not paywall preparedness). (Proposed – under member review.)
