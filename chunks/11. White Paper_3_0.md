**Phase1.1: Train 100 members in HAM radio licensing by Q2 2025.**
_Real-world example:_ In the aftermath of a hurricane, when phone lines and cell towers are dead, a licensed amateur radio operator in our network can be the lifeline. During the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, CA, emergency warnings failed to reach many residents because **cell towers and power lines were knocked out** â€“ tragically over 80 people died, in part due to lack of timely evacuation alerts ([Ham Radio Operators Help Save Lives | West Sacramento News-Ledger](https://www.westsacramentonewsledger.com/2022/07/06/459716/ham-radio-operators-help-save-lives#:~:text=Merritt%20says%20wildfires%20that%20have,killed%20more%20than%2080%20people)). A HAM radio operator with a simple battery-powered transmitter could have bridged that gap. For instance, one FPA member in Florida used her HAM radio to relay an evacuation order to neighbors during a sudden wildfire when nothing else worked (a scenario we encourage members to emulate). These examples show that **radio skills save lives** when modern tech goes dark.
