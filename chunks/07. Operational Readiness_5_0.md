The FPA is not a digital-only alliance; **every critical system is mirrored offline** to ensure resilience:  
|**Core System**|**Offline Mirror**|
|---|---|
|FPA App Dashboard|Wall charts and squad “trust booklets” (printed ledgers of roles/contacts).|
|Test My Plan (AI tool)|Printed skill and gear checklists; _SHTF_ scenario drill maps.|
|Gear Audit (equipment tracking)|Binder inserts and visual inventory cards for physical gear checks.|
|Member Logs (profiles, ranks)|Pen-and-paper rank tracker and trust score logs.|  
Each squad maintains an “**Offline Activation Kit**” with essential items to operate in a no-power situation:  
- **Printed Compass Guide** (updated quarterly with the latest SOPs and ethical guidelines).  
- **Hand-crank or solar-powered radio** (or a shielded HAM unit) for communication.  
- **USB drive with SOP and knowledge base** – contains digital copies of all SOPs, the FPA Dictionary, the _SHTF Bible_, and other references, in case a computer is available offline.  
- **Regional map set** with pre-marked rally points and frequencies (so teams know where to regroup and what channels to use if all else fails).
