- Coordinate a global communications schedule (e.g., weekly nets) and practice cross-border message relays during these nets to build familiarity.  
- Extend Outernet content to include international updates – e.g., disaster alerts or requests from any FPA chapter worldwide, tagged by region for relevance.  
- Develop simple translation protocols: perhaps agreed signal codes or having each chapter prepare messages in both their language and English for broader distribution.  
- Create an international contact directory (callsigns and email) of key communications leads in each country, so operators know whom to reach out to when needing a link.
**Contingency Plan:** If propagation fails (like a solar storm disrupting HF), lean on internet (if available) or satellite phones as backup links between continents. If language issues impede a message, have pre-designated multilingual volunteers in different chapters who can step in to interpret via radio or text. In politically tense times, keep international comms low-profile (amateur radio offers some deniability since it’s a common hobby) to avoid drawing undue attention. Plan that no single country’s net control is critical – if one chapter goes offline, others can still interconnect through alternate paths.
