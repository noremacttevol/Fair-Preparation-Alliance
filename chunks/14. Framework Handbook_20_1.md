- **P – Protect & Plan:** Protect lives and critical assets as the situation unfolds, and formulate a longer-term plan. For example, after initial mitigation, ensure everyone has protective gear (masks in smoky conditions, or warmth in a blizzard, etc.). Then plan the next stages: Are we evacuating or sheltering in place? Who goes where? The Squad Leader, with input, makes a plan beyond the first 15 minutes, guided by the SOP’s suggestions.  
- **A – Adapt & Allocate:** Adapt to new info and allocate tasks. Crises are dynamic – maybe the fire has spread or a squad member is found to be injured. The SOP Compass reminds teams to stay flexible. At this point, specific tasks are allocated to squad members according to their roles. For instance, the Logistics Officer might be tasked with preparing vehicles for possible evacuation while the Communications Lead is relaying updates to other squads. Adaptation is continuous: the SOP gives likely contingencies and fallback options.  
- **S – Sustain & Support:** Many emergencies aren’t over in an hour; some last days or more. This step focuses on sustaining the response effort. Ensure everyone stays hydrated, equipment is functioning, rotations for rest are set if overnight, and so on. Also, bring in support – if the squad needs assistance from neighbors, other squads, or authorities, now is the time to integrate that. Essentially, this is the “maintain your operation” phase, preventing burnout or resource depletion.
