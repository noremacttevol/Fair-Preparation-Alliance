- **External Certification Integration:** By now, we should integrate with external systems to automatically verify and credit certain achievements. For example, if a member goes out and earns an official EMT certification or an amateur radio license, the system could interface with that certifying body’s database or accept an upload of the certificate and then _automatically_ update the member’s First Aid or Comms segment. We’ll pursue partnerships or API integrations with major certification providers (Red Cross, FEMA training, HAM radio organizations, etc.) so that our members don’t have to enter things twice. This not only eases data entry but also enhances credibility (the system knows that a certification is legit because it was verified).
