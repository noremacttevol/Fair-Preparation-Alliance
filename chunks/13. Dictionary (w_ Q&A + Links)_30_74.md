A: FPA’s knowledge base (the collection of all Q&As, guides, SOPs, etc.) is maintained likely through a combination of centralized curation and distributed contribution. There might be a core team or editor group that oversees updates (as mentioned in Mk1Mod3 tasks), ensuring consistency and quality. However, members contribute by submitting their insights, questions, or local adaptations – possibly via an online platform or during council meetings. The base is shared in multiple formats: a digital repository (like an Obsidian vault or a secure wiki) accessible to all members, printed handbooks for those who want hard copies or in case of digital failure, and probably bite-sized versions (cheat sheets, checklists) for quick reference. To keep everyone on the same page, FPA might issue a quarterly or annual “knowledge update” bulletin highlighting new entries or changes. New members get a briefing or starter pack distilled from the base. For security, sensitive details (like member directories or cache locations) might be kept separate from the general knowledge base, which focuses on skills and doctrine. Sharing among members is also encouraged through mentoring – experienced members walk newcomers through key parts of the knowledge base, contextualizing it. FPA could hold knowledge-sharing sessions where each person presents something from the base they’ve tried or mastered, reinforcing its use. They likely use the knowledge base to create standard training curricula for
