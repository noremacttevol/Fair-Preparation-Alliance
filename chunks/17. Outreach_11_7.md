**Measuring Success in Interpreters:** It’s admittedly hard to quantify, but we track things like how many volunteers are stepping into leadership or instructor roles, how many independent initiatives spin off (perhaps an FPA-inspired group forms in a place we didn’t actively reach, thanks to an interpreter moving there or remote influence). Another metric: during an event, how many decisions or adaptations were made autonomously that proved effective? If, say, communications are cut and a local group still managed to do everything right by themselves, that’s a gold standard showing our doctrine lived within them. We collect these anecdotes and data to continuously validate that our approach of building interpreters is working. If we find pockets of passive consumer mentality, we adjust our outreach to stir more engagement there.
