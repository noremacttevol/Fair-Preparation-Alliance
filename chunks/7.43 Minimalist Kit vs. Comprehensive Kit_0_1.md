- Comprehensive Kit: This is the full assembly – your home’s cache or your loaded backpack/vehicle for a planned bug-out. It covers all categories in depth: not just one way to purify water but three, not just snacks but full meals and cooking gear, medical supplies for serious injuries, multiple changes of clothes, etc. It’s what you’d ideally have at a base camp or if evacuating with a car. FPA helps members maintain both: a comprehensive kit at home (shelter-in-place supplies as in [[7.23 Home Shelter-in-Place Supplies]]) and a leaner kit for quick evacuations.  
- Modularity: They teach packing gear in modules that can be detached or left behind as needed. For example, your pack might have a core survival module that is the minimalist kit, plus a comfort module (with tent, stove, etc.) that you could drop if you needed to move faster or if resupply is ample. This way you can scale down on the fly.  
- Phased Gear Use: In Phase 1 (normal), you have everything. In Phase 3 (extreme conditions), you might be down to essentials. Training includes practicing with both ends of the spectrum so you’re not helpless without a certain piece.
