The **public trust badges** (like specialist badges for skills with proven track record) have motivated skill proficiency as well – members strive to earn the “Verified Medic” badge which requires endorsements from at least 2 people who received first aid from them in training. The Trust Graph also helped identify natural connectors – a few members had many trust links (because they’ve helped lots of people). We’ve tapped some of these highly trusted members to act as **Trust Ambassadors** or mediators when disputes arise, leveraging their social capital.
