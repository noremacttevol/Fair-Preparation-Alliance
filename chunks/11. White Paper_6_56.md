When a severe storm knocked out power and cell service, those little radios became the squad’s lifeline, allowing them to coordinate clearing debris and checking homes. In Northern California, the Cobb Alert Net group took this further by establishing tiers of radios: ham operators as a backbone, GMRS for area leaders, and FRS for local residents ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=The%20basic%20arrangement%20is%20simple%3A,that%20their%20radios%20are%20functioning)). This layered approach let them cover distances from a few blocks to many miles, all independently of the grid. Indeed, radio’s big advantage is it works when the internet and phone lines fail ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning
