members pledge to uphold these ethics, and if one is caught looting or stealing unjustly, they face consequences (likely expulsion, as it breaks trust). They train on alternatives: stockpile to reduce need to scavenge; practice barter to get what you need from willing others; and only scavenge as a last resort and as carefully as possible. There could be a guideline list, like: “Allowed: picking fruit from wild or neglected trees; using materials from ruined unowned structures; taking supplies from a store only if no owner/employees present to transact and situation is desperate. Not allowed: breaking into an occupied home; using violence for stuff; taking more than necessary causing others to go without.” They also talk about mindset: you do this to survive or help others survive, not to profit or hoard. After a crisis, if normalcy returns, attempts should be made to make amends for what was scavenged if identifiable. By instilling these rules, FPA aims to keep moral high ground and community trust – being known as helpers, not looters, which also preserves their reputation and relationships with the broader community.
