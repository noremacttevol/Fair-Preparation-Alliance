A: FPA members often set up survival caches to have backup supplies available if they can’t access their main stockpile. The alliance provides guidelines on doing this effectively and discreetly. To create a cache, members first decide what its purpose is (for example: a resupply halfway to their bug-out location, or a buried kit at a friend’s property in case their house is lost). Typical cache contents include water pouches, food (freeze-dried or MREs sealed to prevent pests), basic first aid, a change of clothes, copies of important documents on a USB or paper, ammunition, fire starters, and maybe a cheap phone or radio with batteries. They’ll use durable, waterproof containers like PVC pipes sealed at the ends, ammo cans with gasket seals, or buckets with gamma lids – often double-wrapped in contractor bags for extra moisture protection. Location-wise, FPA suggests places that are unlikely to be disturbed: that could be on public land (burying off a seldom-used trail, noting landmarks and GPS coordinates), or better, on private land with permission (like another member’s rural property), or even hidden within structures (like a false wall in a shed). Some caches can be urban: e.g., renting a small storage unit under a pseudonym just for an emergency stash, though keys/access can be an issue in a crisis. Security is a priority, so they bury or hide caches well: digging at least 2-3 feet deep, covering with natural ground cover, and not leaving obvious markers (they
