Squad Leads/Facilitators: Many squads have an informal or formal lead (or facilitator) who coordinates the team’s work. Squad leads are not “bosses” in the traditional sense – FPA values self-management – but they carry a responsibility to foster a healthy team dynamic. A squad lead should monitor the squad’s climate and intervene if tensions are rising or communication breaks down. They might facilitate a discussion or initiate a pause protocol (defined below) if a conflict is harming the squad’s functioning. If two members cannot resolve a clash, the squad lead ensures the next steps (like bringing in a mediator or informing the circle’s Trust Liaison) are taken rather than ignoring the problem. However, the squad lead is not the ultimate arbiter of disputes; they are a facilitator and conduit to further support, ensuring the squad follows the established process.
