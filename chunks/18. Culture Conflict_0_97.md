Institutional Memory and Tradition: Over time, as we successfully manage conflicts and endure, FPA will build a proud legacy of unity. Stories will be told of crises that were overcome, of near-splits that were healed. These become part of our institutional memory and even doctrine. New generations of members will learn these stories and feel a duty to uphold that tradition of unity. It becomes a self-reinforcing narrative: “We are an Alliance that doesn’t quit on each other.” This psychological commitment can be very powerful, almost sacred. It’s akin to a constitutional tradition in a country – it guides behavior in unseen ways. Our framework here, by lasting through time, itself becomes a symbol of continuity. The fact that we have a centurial document guiding conflict means people look to it in times of trouble rather than acting rashly.
