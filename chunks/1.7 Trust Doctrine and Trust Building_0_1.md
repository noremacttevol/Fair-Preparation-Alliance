bonds strengthen trust in the larger network. It also emphasizes honesty internally: members are expected to be truthful about their capabilities and intentions; any deceit is seen as a severe breach (leading to [[Disciplinary Actions and Removal]] if needed). Additionally, the doctrine defines protocols for conflict resolution – if trust is broken (e.g., a member violates an agreement or security), there is a process to address it (see [[Conflict Resolution and Discipline]]). By articulating these principles, the Trust Doctrine serves as both a philosophy and practical guide: it reassures members that they can rely on one another and provides a common understanding that trust is earned and cherished. Many FPA members consider the Trust Doctrine the “glue” of the Alliance – it turns a collection of preppers into a true community. (Cross-reference: [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] which codifies behaviors that build trust, and [[Assisting Non-Members in Crisis]] which addresses extending trust carefully to outsiders.)
