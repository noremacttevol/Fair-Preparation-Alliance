parties to maintain trust in the process (e.g., each can suggest a name and they pick one they both feel okay with). This is essentially in-circle remediation in practice: using resources within the immediate group (or its parent circle) to heal the conflict. It aligns with FPA’s peer accountability principle – peers help peers solve issues, rather than immediately invoking authority. During this step, the mediator may reference FPA’s values or prior similar cases to help guide towards a resolution. All involved might agree on certain actions (for instance, “We will check in with each other twice a week to ensure we stay aligned on the timeline” or “We apologize and commit to a more collaborative planning process going forward”). These agreements can be written down or emailed as a record, to avoid future confusion.
