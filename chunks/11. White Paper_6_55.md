- If feasible, equip it with some means for community members to leave messages too (like a pencil and paper in a ziplock or a whiteboard section). That way people can, say, scribble “The James family evacuated to High School shelter” or “Generator available at 123 Maple if needed” – facilitating peer-to-peer aid. Have a squad member check and organize these periodically to relay critical ones to broader channels.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If maintaining a physical board is too difficult (vandalism, no good site), an alternative is a “mobile info desk” – basically a member with a sandwich board or flag who stands at a known spot at certain hours to answer questions and share news. Also, you might utilize public radio if accessible: arrange with a local radio station for emergency community updates (some areas have agreements for community groups to call in reports). But radio assumes people have battery radios; a board is in everyone’s walking distance ideally. Prepare to translate/post in multiple languages if your community is multilingual – don’t leave anyone in the dark due to language barriers.
