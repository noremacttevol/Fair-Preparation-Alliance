The Fair Preparation Alliance **Skill Wheel and Knowledge Management** system (abbreviated **FPAKM**) is a comprehensive member profiling and training platform designed to **enhance disaster preparedness through visual feedback, targeted learning, and honest assessment**. Every FPA member has a personal Skill Wheel in their profile – a quick-reference dashboard displaying their competencies across key survival domains. The vision is to **motivate lifelong learning and realistic readiness**. The Skill Wheel should reveal both a member’s strengths and their gaps, inspiring continuous improvement without fostering complacency or false confidence. This strategic plan outlines the system’s design, phased implementation, integration points, and guiding principles (drawing on internal FPA doctrines like the [[Trust Doctrine]]) to ensure the Skill Wheel and knowledge management components are effective, trustworthy, and aligned with FPA’s mission.  
**Goals of the Skill Wheel system:**  
- **Holistic Skill Visualization:** Represent each member’s proficiency in multiple core preparedness categories in one clear graphic (a “wheel”) anchored by their identity (badge, rank, call sign).  
- **Personalized Readiness Insights:** Provide honest yet encouraging indicators of how prepared a member is (with no one ever shown at 0%, to preserve morale) and what their projected survivability might be in crises.
