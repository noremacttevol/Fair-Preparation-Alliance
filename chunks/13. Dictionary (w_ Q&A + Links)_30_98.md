A: FPA maintains accountability and vetting through a mix of personal interaction and a probationary period. When someone wants to join, they usually need to meet current members in person – perhaps coming to a few open meetings or trainings. During this time, existing members get a sense of their character, reasons for joining, and whether they vibe with FPA’s ethos (cooperative, not extremist, etc.). They likely run the person through the Trust Doctrine principles to see if there’s alignment. Some chapters might do a background check for red flags if resources allow, or at least a community reference check (“does anyone know this person?”). Once they start participating, they might be paired with a mentor (an experienced member) who guides them, which also acts as oversight – the mentor can spot any concerning behavior or inconsistency. The new member might initially not be privy to more sensitive info (like exact cache locations or member personal details) until they’ve shown commitment over some months. FPA could have a formal “provisional member” status where someone has to attend X trainings, demonstrate basic skills, and contribute positively before being considered a full member. This process itself is a test of accountability: do they show up reliably? Do they follow through on tasks? If issues arise (say they break a small rule or cause friction), chapter leaders address it early. For existing members, accountability is maintained by a culture of transparency and
