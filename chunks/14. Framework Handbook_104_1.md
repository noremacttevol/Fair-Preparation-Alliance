- **Knowledge Base Access:** Essentially a digital copy of the SHTF Bible (Chapter 7) is accessible in the app. It’s searchable by keyword, so you can quickly find that water purification chart or first aid steps. This library is stored offline on your device after initial download.  
- **Gear Shop & Dynamic Pricing:** An integrated marketplace allows members to obtain recommended gear or trade items. The app shows prices adjusted by the fair pricing model (Chapter 10), and any subsidies or credits you have. If internet is down, it can switch to a local trade mode – listing what people nearby have for barter or loan via Bluetooth/mesh connection.  
All these features are designed with offline-first principles. Messages queue and attempt every available path (mesh, SMS, Wi-Fi) until delivered. Data sync happens opportunistically – if your phone encounters another member’s phone, they exchange updates (a bit like a digital “sneakernet”). In short, the app works hard to keep you connected with your community even when the grid is down.  
**Security & Privacy:** Since sensitive information (like locations or inventories) may be shared, the app uses strong encryption for data in transit and at rest. Following the Trust Doctrine, members’ privacy is respected. Even if someone intercepted our mesh traffic, they’d only see encrypted data. The app requires member login, and if a device is lost, a remote wipe command can erase data once it contacts another device (preventing leaks).
