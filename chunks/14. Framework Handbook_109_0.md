Not all survival gear is created equal. There’s a flood of products out there, some excellent, some junk. FPA’s Approved Gear List is a curated catalog of equipment that has been tested and vetted by our community. From water filters to two-way radios, each item on the list meets criteria of **reliability, affordability, and interoperability** with our system.  
- **Reliability:** We test items in real or simulated conditions. If we recommend a portable stove, it’s because multiple members used it successfully in the field. If a certain flashlight model tends to break or a water filter fails quickly, we exclude it. This saves members from wasting money or, worse, being let down when they depend on the gear most.  
- **Affordability:** We aim to include at least one budget-friendly option in each category that still does the job. Not everyone can buy top-of-the-line gear. For example, our first aid kit category might list a high-end comprehensive kit and also a basic kit covering essentials – both vetted for effectiveness at their price point. Whenever possible, we negotiate bulk discounts from manufacturers. FPA chapters often do group-buys (e.g., purchasing 100 quality hand-crank radios at wholesale) and pass the savings to members.
