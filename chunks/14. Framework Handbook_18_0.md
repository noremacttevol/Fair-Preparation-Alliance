When a crisis strikes, chaos and confusion are the first enemies. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** are the antidote – they provide a predefined game plan so that everyone knows what to do, even when stressed. FPA’s **SOP Compass Guide** is a collection of such game plans, covering a wide range of emergencies. It’s called a “Compass” because it’s designed to **keep us oriented on the right priorities** amid the turmoil, much like a compass needle steadying one’s direction.
