and forwarded. It serves as a **fall-back** when internet-based comms fail. We will have a protocol for what gets sent: likely a periodic “information dump” at set intervals (e.g., top of every hour) containing updates verified by FPA central or unaffected regional nodes. Those receiving the data can then act as local re-broadcasters (printing it out, reading it over local radios, etc.). In some scenarios, the Outernet might also allow two-way (if nodes can send short bursts via satellite uplink), which could let isolated communities send status reports or requests upstream.
