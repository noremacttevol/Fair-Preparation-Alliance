farm or building for better defense), they establish a perimeter. This could involve setting up obstacles (vehicles, barricades) at key entry points, laying out fields of view for surveillance, and designating guard posts. The SOP might assign two-person guard shifts to ensure at least one awake guard at all times when threat level is high. [[Coordination Structure and Chain of Command]] and specialized roles come into play here – e.g., a member with military or security background might be in charge of organizing defense. Rules of Engagement: FPA’s ethical stance informs their defensive rules – they do not seek conflict and will avoid violence if possible. Members are trained to de-escalate; for instance, if strangers approach, the initial response might be to warn them off from a distance or negotiate (maybe offering a small aid rather than risk an attack). However, if an attack is imminent, members are prepared to defend themselves with proportionate force. [[Self-Defense and Firearms Training]] ensures those who carry weapons are proficient and understand local laws (in Phase 1, everything is legal ownership; in Phase 2, they adapt as needed). Non-Lethal Defenses: FPA also considers non-lethal deterrents – floodlights, loud alarms, pepper spray, tear gas if available, etc., to ward off intruders without immediate resort to lethal force. They stock items like heavy-duty pepper gel, stun devices, or even paintball guns with pepper balls for area denial at closer ranges.
