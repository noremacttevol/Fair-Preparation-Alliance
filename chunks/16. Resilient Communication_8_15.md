In summary, when centralized comms or command fails, the Alliance doctrine shifts to local network mode. Squads talk to squads, forming resilient mesh networks with multiple fallback methods (radios, runners, signals). Pre-planned procedures like PACE and chain-of-command succession kick in to prevent chaos. Leaders use coded signals and prior agreements to make sure everyone knows when and how to operate autonomously. Through practice and trust, what could be a communications breakdown becomes merely a reorganization at a more local scale. Our Alliance is designed to **bend, not break**, if cut in half or thirds by comms outages â€“ each piece can function and later rejoin, because all pieces follow the same doctrine.
