**Objective:** Outline the Fair Preparation Alliance’s user application process and end-to-end journey, from initial signup through active membership, in a phased approach. This strategy is structured for internal use (Obsidian-style linking) with Phase 1 focus on a manual, offline-capable rollout, and Phases 2–3 introducing AI support and squad self-management. It integrates the FPA’s trust, culture, and progression frameworks at every step.
