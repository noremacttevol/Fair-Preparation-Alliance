Perhaps the most emblematic prep, the Bug-Out Bag (BOB) – or simply Go Bag – is a backpack pre-packed with everything one needs to survive for about 3 days when evacuating. FPA guides all members in assembling and regularly updating their BOBs. A typical FPA-recommended BOB contains:  
- Water: around 2-3 liters per person, plus a filter or purification tablets for obtaining more (water is heavy, so they balance carrying some vs ability to get more).  
- Food: non-perishable, ready-to-eat items for 72 hours (energy bars, trail mix, dried meals) focusing on high calorie and ease of preparation (minimal cooking, just add water, etc.).  
- Clothing: a change of clothes suitable for weather (thermal underwear, socks, durable pants, weatherproof jacket, hat, gloves) – layering is emphasized. Also a mylar blanket or compact sleeping bag for warmth.  
- Shelter: a lightweight tent or tarp with cordage, or at least a bivvy sack. Something to keep off rain and wind.  
- Fire-making: lighters, waterproof matches, ferro rod – ideally two methods.  
- First Aid Kit: a more robust kit than EDC, including trauma items (tourniquet, gauze, antiseptic, any personal prescriptions for a week).  
- Tools: knife (if not already in EDC), multi-tool, maybe a small folding saw or wire for snares, duct tape (often wrapped on a small flat piece), and a few yards of paracord.  
- Lighting: headlamp (with spare batteries) plus a small backup flashlight or chem light sticks.
