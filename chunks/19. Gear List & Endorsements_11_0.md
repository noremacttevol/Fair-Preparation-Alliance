For this doctrine to be more than words on paper, it must be actively upheld, periodically reviewed, and democratically controlled by the membership. This section covers how the Gear List & Endorsements Doctrine is enforced in practice, how it becomes officially adopted, and the mechanism for updating it in the future.  
- **Member Ratification:** This strategic charter, once drafted and agreed upon by the drafting committee (with input from existing reference materials like the Trust Doctrine and Offline Resilience guidelines), will be presented to the full membership for ratification. We use a transparent voting process (much like endorsing a piece of gear) where each member or squad can vote to Adopt or Reject the doctrine. A supermajority (for example, two-thirds of voting members) is required to ratify, ensuring broad support. During the ratification period, members can discuss and suggest minor modifications. Those suggestions, if widely supported, may be incorporated before final adoption. Once ratified, this document becomes an official governing policy of FPA. It is essentially our “Constitution” for gear and endorsement matters, meaning all members agree to abide by it upon joining or renewing membership. New members will be educated on it as part of their orientation.
