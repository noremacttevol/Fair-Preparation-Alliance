> Canonical references: [[TERM:Offline-First Resilience System (OFRS)]], [[TERM:TMP (Test My Plan)]], [[TERM:Trust Doctrine]]  
**Suggested Insertions:**
- Use `[[TERM:OFRS]]` where referring to overall offline doctrine
- Tag `[[TERM:TMP (Test My Plan)]]` wherever the plan simulator or scenario engine is referenced
- Use `[[TERM:Trust Doctrine]]` in place of any general 'trust standard' phrasing
