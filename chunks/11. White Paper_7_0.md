([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/)) _Volunteers from a community-run alert network staff an outreach booth to educate neighbors about emergency radio communications (Cobb Mountain, CA, 2023). Building such local initiatives and then coordinating with official agencies greatly enhances disaster preparedness._  
Effective integration with formal emergency structures and neighboring organizations is a force multiplier for FPA squads. This section details how to interface with entities like FEMA’s Community Emergency Response Team program, the Incident Command System (ICS) used by professional responders, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), while preserving the squad’s grassroots character. The goal is a two-way street: squads receive intelligence, training, or resources from officials/NGOs, and in turn provide local knowledge and manpower as trusted partners during crises.
