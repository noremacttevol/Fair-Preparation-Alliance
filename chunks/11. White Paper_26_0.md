**Description:** Implement systems for alliance-wide decision-making and feedback, ensuring that the broader FPA membership has a voice in major decisions. This includes setting up a secure voting process for things like electing national leaders or approving changes to the Trust Doctrine, as well as continuous feedback channels (surveys, after-action reviews) that feed into council decisions. The goal is to maintain grassroots control and buy-in even as we organize nationally: FPA remains by the members, for the members.
**Real-World Example:** In 2027, the National Council proposed a significant update to the Trust Doctrine to incorporate Phase 3 lessons on AI use and partnerships. Rather than just declare it, they put it up for a vote among all squads. Using a combination of an online portal and radio call-in verification for offline squads, votes were tallied over a two-week period. Over 85% of squads participated, and the doctrine update passed with 92% approval â€“ providing a strong mandate and sense of unity. Additionally, an anonymous post-disaster feedback survey was introduced via Outernet broadcasts; for example, after a large deployment, any member could send in critiques or praises which the council compiled to learn from. These mechanisms proved that even at scale, FPA could stay responsive to its base, avoiding the pitfall of many organizations that lose touch as they grow.
