24. **Milestone 24: Build a Squad Website/Social Media Presence**  
- _Real-World Example:_ One FPA squad set up a very basic website (a single page with their mission, meeting info, and contact email). This paid off when a local journalist stumbled on it and ended up writing a feature about the squad’s efforts, which then drew in new volunteers and donations. Another squad used a Facebook page to regularly post preparedness tips and updates, gradually becoming recognized online as a community resource. When floods occurred, people already following that page knew who to message for help. Conversely, a squad that stayed completely off the public radar had trouble growing and getting support because few knew they existed until a crisis hit.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ **Transparency and outreach extend to the digital realm.** A public-facing channel (website or social media) serves multiple purposes: recruitment, credibility, disseminating info, and connecting with FPA at large. It doesn’t need to be fancy – consistency and clarity matter more. **Lesson:** In the 2020s, an online presence is nearly essential for legitimacy. It also forces the squad to articulate its message, which can sharpen focus. However, maintain OPSEC (operational security) on specifics – don’t publish personal data or sensitive plans; keep those internal.
