The Fair Preparation Alliance isn’t about developing secret tech or monetizing ideas – but we do create a lot of valuable knowledge, training materials, software tools, and plans. We treat these **intellectual properties (IP)** as collective assets that protect and empower our members. In other words, **our IP is a shield for the alliance**, not a commercial product to sell. Here’s what that means in practice:  
- **Open Access for Members:** Any tool or material developed within FPA (like our disaster response playbooks, the [[Compass Guide]] of best practices, training videos, or our custom offline communication app) is accessible to all members. We don’t hide critical knowledge behind paywalls or elitist circles. The whole point is to spread useful information and capabilities across the network so we’re all stronger. If you’re in the alliance, you get to benefit from the alliance’s collective know-how. This fosters trust – there’s no suspicion that some secret manual exists only for the “high-ups.”
