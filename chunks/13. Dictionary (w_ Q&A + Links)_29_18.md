Q18: What does “mutual aid” mean in prepping communities?
A: Mutual aid means people helping each other in a crisis rather than everyone being on their own. In a prepping context, it’s an arrangement where individuals or families pool resources, skills, and efforts so that everyone is better off. For example, in a neighborhood group, one person might provide a generator, another might have medical training, and another might store extra food – together they cover each other’s needs. It’s essentially reciprocal support: you assist others and they assist you. Mutual aid is the opposite of the “lone wolf” mentality; it recognizes that in many disaster situations, cooperation can save lives. FPA strongly encourages mutual aid networks because a group of prepared people working together is far more resilient than any one person alone. [#Beginner] [#Community]  
Q19: What is the “Rule of Threes” in survival?
A: The “Rule of Threes” is a rough guideline for human survival priorities in extreme situations:  
- 3 minutes without breathable air (or bleeding control): Lack of oxygen (or uncontrolled bleeding) can kill fastest – within minutes.  
- 3 hours without shelter (in a harsh environment): In extreme cold or heat, exposure can be fatal in mere hours if you have no shelter or proper clothing.  
- 3 days without water: The human body will start to shut down after a few days with no water. Dehydration becomes life-threatening around the third day.
