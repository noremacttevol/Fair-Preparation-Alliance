- **Fairness Above All:** This dynamic model ensures **no profiteering**. Early members aren’t penalized with higher fees later, and latecomers don’t get a free ride on infrastructure paid by others – everyone pays a little while needed, and no one pays once it’s not needed. It’s a collective investment in our safety. Also, a **member in good standing** who truly can’t afford the $5 in the early days can petition for a waiver or perform extra duties in lieu – money should never exclude someone willing to work for the cause. We have mechanisms (overseen by the Governance team) to quietly handle hardship cases. We’d rather have a committed prepper who’s broke than a rich spectator. The fairness principle is baked in at every level.  
In summary, **our funding scales with us** and then tapers off when possible. It’s a living system that reflects our values: **self-reliance, fairness, and transparency**. As an FPA member, you’re not a customer buying a service – you’re a stakeholder building an alliance. The Dynamic Pricing Model makes sure your money is always used for the mission, and the moment it isn’t needed, it’s not taken. That’s _fair preparation_ in action.
