- **Purpose of Interaction:** (e.g., “Vendor inquired about test results”, “FPA requested product sample”, “Follow-up on identified issue”, “Vendor offering discount”, etc.)  
- **Summary of Discussion/Content:** A concise but clear summary. If it’s a written communication like email, you can quote key lines. If it’s verbal, paraphrase the main points. _Example:_ “Vendor asked if we could share testing methodology for their review – we explained our process is internal but we will publish findings. Vendor mentioned they are addressing the battery issue we found and offered to send revised units. We reiterated that any new units will undergo fresh tests. No requests were made by FPA aside from technical clarification on battery type. Vendor did not request any endorsement or preferential treatment.”  
- **Outcome/Resolution:** What happened as a result? (e.g., “Scheduled to send two replacement units by July; FPA to retest upon arrival. Logged vendor promise to fix issue. No change in endorsement status until retest.” Or “No further action needed – call was informational.”)  
- **Notes/Follow-up Required:** (e.g., “Ensure replacement units are the same spec as retail version. Follow up by end of July if units not received.”)  
- **Attachment Reference:** If there are attachments like a PDF from the vendor or an email thread, note where it’s stored (e.g., “See vendor_comm/brightbeam_june15.pdf in database”).  
- **Logged by:** (Name/ID of the member writing the log entry)
