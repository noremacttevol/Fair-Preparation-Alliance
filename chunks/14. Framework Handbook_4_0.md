Mk1Mod3 is not a departure from FPA’s earlier framework (Mk1Mod2), but rather a **significant evolution**. Over the course of implementing Mk1Mod2, the FPA community learned valuable lessons about what worked well and what needed improvement. Mk1Mod3 addresses those gaps head-on. This chapter provides an overview of the major changes, organized into three categories: strategic shifts, cultural evolution, and operational enhancements.  
In short, Mk1Mod2 laid a strong foundation, but Mk1Mod3 builds atop it with greater **integration**, **fairness**, and **realism**. By understanding these high-level improvements, you’ll better appreciate the detailed components discussed in later chapters.
