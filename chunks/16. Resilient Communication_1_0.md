When the grid dies and the stakes rise, **communication is survival**. This doctrine lays out how the Free Preparedness Alliance (FPA) maintains command, control, and community through resilient communications when conventional systems fail. It bridges our plans and our execution in the field, ensuring that every member – from new recruits to veteran squad leaders – operates on the same wavelength (literally and figuratively) when disaster strikes. There is no fluff here and no room for ambiguity. We speak plainly: without reliable communication, all other preparation is just noise. This section replaces the old Section 16 with a sharper, mission-first doctrine that turns tools into a coordinated network, transforming individual preparedness into an Alliance-wide force multiplier.  
**Scope:** This document covers EMP-proofing of comms and power, use of HAM radio in crises, deployment of field-ready mobile units (with offline knowledge), incentive structures for readiness, training standards at each Operational Readiness Progression (ORP) phase, community network formation, and integration with core FPA principles (Trust Doctrine, Offline-First Resilience, Gear Endorsements, Compass SOPs). It is the definitive guide to communication-readiness-as-resilience for all FPA members.
