**Why the “Compass” Guide?** Just as a compass provides direction, this guide keeps every member oriented on our mission and values. In a field crowded with hype and fear-mongering, the FPA Compass Guide is blunt and realistic – it spells out _why_ we operate the way we do, without any sugarcoating. This isn’t a pep talk or a glossy brochure; it’s a grounding reference to ensure we all stay on the same page. You’ll find explanations of FPA’s philosophy, from big-picture ethics down to everyday protocols. Whenever you’re unsure _why_ the FPA chooses one approach over another, the answer should be in here.  
**How to use it:** New recruits should read through this guide during their orientation. It will give you context behind the rules and checklists you’ll follow. Seasoned members refer back to it whenever we face tough decisions or need to recalibrate our approach. The Compass Guide works alongside the other FPA resources – the **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]** tells you _what_ something means, the **SHTF Bible** (our survival manual) tells you _how_ to do something, and the Compass Guide tells you _why_ it matters. Together, these ensure your mindset and actions stay true to FPA’s mission.
