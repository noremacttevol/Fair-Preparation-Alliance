We ensure multiple pathways for communication:  
- **Multichannel Communication:** Every message or alert in FPA can be sent via multiple channels. For instance, if there’s a region-wide alert (say a natural disaster warning), the system will push it via internet (app notification), SMS texts to those who have cell service, radio broadcast scripts for those with radios, and even automated phone calls if needed. Squads also have phone trees or runner systems if high-tech means are down. This layering guarantees that the chance of nobody receiving the message is near zero.  
- **Radio Networks:** Many FPA members are trained and licensed in amateur radio use. We have designated FPA radio frequencies and call signs. In a severe scenario where internet and phone networks are down, radio becomes primary. We have protocols for daily check-ins over radio when in “comms outage mode”. Sat phones or messengers are another layer especially for remote area squads.  
- **Signal Codes:** As a last resort, we even establish simple physical signals (like colored flags or symbols marked at a pre-agreed location) to convey basic messages (“squad moved to fallback location”, “need help”, “all ok”) in case direct contact is impossible. These are documented in the Compass Guide.
