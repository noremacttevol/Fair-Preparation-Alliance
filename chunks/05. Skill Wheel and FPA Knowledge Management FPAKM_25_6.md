- **Continuous Review of Metrics:** We will continuously scrutinize the system itself. The question we’ll keep asking is, “Is this metric or feature driving real preparedness, or has it become hollow?” If we ever identify an aspect of the system that isn’t contributing to our mission, we will change or remove it. For instance, if we had introduced a badge for “30-day login streak” (just a hypothetical example) and found that people were just opening the app daily to keep the streak alive without engaging in training, we’d eliminate that badge. The idea is to ensure all incentives remain meaningful. This approach echoes best practices in gamified systems where designers periodically adjust the program to prevent counterproductive habits. Our measurement of success isn’t high scores themselves, but correlations with actual resilience and performance. So the metrics must evolve if they stop reflecting that.
