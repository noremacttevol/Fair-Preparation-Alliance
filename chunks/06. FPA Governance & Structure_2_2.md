**Resilience of Distributed Teams:** This circle system isn’t just theory; it’s been tested. During a recent statewide grid-down drill, local FPA circles continued operating independently when central comms went dark. Neighboring circles self-organized supply sharing and security patrols, guided only by our shared protocols and a few ham radio messages. **The result:** while a hypothetical “central command” would have been overwhelmed or unreachable, our circles kept things running on their own, then reconnected once communications were restored to coordinate the bigger picture. This is the power of distributing authority: even if part of the network fails, the rest can still function. Our interoperability protocols (shared procedures and common training from the _Compass Guide_ of best practices) act as the glue that allows many small teams to function as one alliance when needed.
