**Identifying Potential Interpreters:** Not everyone will take on this role, and that’s fine. We still value participants at all levels. But part of our outreach is designed to spot those who show initiative, curiosity, and leadership potential. Signs include: individuals who start contributing their own ideas or local adaptations (e.g., someone who after a workshop goes and creates a bilingual version of our flyer for their neighborhood – unprompted), or someone who consistently answers others’ questions in online forums correctly (showing they’ve absorbed the knowledge). Often these folks volunteer for more responsibility. We tap them for roles like _Community Ambassador_ or _Training Lead_ in their squad. We might give them early access to new materials or involve them in doctrine discussions, which only feeds their understanding more.
