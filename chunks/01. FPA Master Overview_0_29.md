Interdepartmental Communication: Core Coordination also ensures that all the content families (Coordination, Tech, Readiness, Comms, Governance) work in sync and share information. They run regular leadership sync-ups (like a weekly command council meeting) where each family reports status and needs. If Tech needs priorities from Governance, or Outreach needs info from Readiness, Core makes sure it happens. They mediate between departments if priorities conflict. Essentially, they prevent silos â€“ everyone stays on the same page. During operations, Core serves as the hub through which critical information flows out to the right teams and feedback flows back in for decision-making.
