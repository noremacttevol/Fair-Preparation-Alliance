- **Public Outreach & Recruitment:** On the external side, Outreach works on **growing our numbers and alliances**. They manage the public face of FPA. This includes maintaining our website content, social media (if we use it), public workshops, and media relations. They’re the ones who might host a booth at a preparedness expo or give a talk at a town hall about community resilience. Their style is factual but relatable, avoiding any cultish vibe. Outreach emphasizes **the fairness and community aspect** of FPA to attract like-minded people: “We’re not here to sell fear; we’re here to share readiness. Join us, learn skills, contribute to your community’s safety.” They often highlight the dynamic pricing and transparency to build trust with the public. For recruitment, they provide brochures, flyers, maybe run local ads (if budget allows) or partner with friendly local businesses (e.g., outdoor gear shops, gun ranges, ham radio clubs) to spread the word. They keep track of recruitment numbers and adjust strategies: if sign-ups lag in some region, they’ll swarm it with outreach events.
