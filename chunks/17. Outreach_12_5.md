**A Call to Leadership and Creativity:** Building this system is not just following instructions – it’s a creative, problem-solving endeavor. We encourage you to innovate. The strategy document provides a framework, but each locale and team might have brilliant ideas to contribute. Maybe you design a new kind of micro-guide or figure out a better way to engage youth (future interpreters) via a game or social challenge. The constitution metaphor holds: amendments can and will be made as we learn. You are constitutional convention delegates _and_ later legislators amending it. That’s exciting – it’s a living process. Share your ideas, experiment in your region, and if it works, we’ll propagate it network-wide. This sense of _ownership_ at all levels is key to maintaining motivation. You’re not a cog in a machine; you’re a pioneer cutting a trail that others will follow.
