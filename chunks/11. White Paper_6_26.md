11. **Milestone 11: Acquire Basic Gear via Low-Cost Methods**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A low-income squad in Detroit built their own supply cache almost entirely from donations and creativity. They held a “prep drive” at the local grocery store where people donated canned food and flashlights. A construction company donated a couple of high-visibility vests and hard hats. The squad coordinator scrounged surplus medical supplies (bandages, gloves) from a friend who works at a clinic. Within months, they had a respectable community emergency kit without spending more than $50 of their own funds. In contrast, another group that waited for grants wasted precious time; gear trickled in a year later, but they had already faced a blizzard empty-handed.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ **Don’t wait for perfect equipment** – start gathering essentials in any way possible. Low-resource communities often have to be inventive. A lot of useful items are cheap or free if you ask around. And remember, knowledge beats gear if you must choose; but ideally have both. **Lesson:** Prioritize gear that enables members to act safely (e.g., gloves, helmets, lights) and communicate (radios, whistles). FPA’s aggressive realism means acknowledging that in a true disaster, store shelves empty fast – so build your cache in calm times.
