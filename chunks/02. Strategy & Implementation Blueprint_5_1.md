- **The “Compass” Philosophy:** We call it the Compass because it provides direction. It also encodes our values – e.g., sections on ethics and the Trust Doctrine, so that members understand not just _what_ to do, but _why_ we do it that way. It is blunt about real-world conditions and doesn’t sugarcoat the difficulties in crises, preparing members mentally and technically.  
- **Regular Drills:** **Drills** are the practical expression of SOPs. Squads are expected to run drills regularly (e.g. weekly or monthly scenarios) to practice their response to situations such as power outage, natural disaster, communications blackout, medical emergency, etc. Drills test both the squad’s execution of SOPs and the equipment. Outcomes of drills are reviewed against the SOP checklists and logged. This **“Test My Plan”** approach – often aided by our AI which can generate or evaluate scenarios – allows members to identify gaps in their plans or skills in a safe practice environment.  
- **Continuous Improvement:** SOPs and drills form a feedback loop. If a drill reveals a flaw in an SOP or suggests a better way to do something, that feedback goes into updating the Compass Guide. Thus, procedures are living documents refined by actual practice (in alignment with the Living System Clause).
