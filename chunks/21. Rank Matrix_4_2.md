- **E-9 (Instructor):** Take your mentorship to a broader audience and demonstrate technical ingenuity. To reach E-9, you must **run an advanced training course or workshop for multiple members** _and_ complete a significant technical project. For instance, you might design and lead a multi-session course on wilderness survival or advanced first aid for fellow members. Additionally, you **build and demonstrate an EMP-proof gear solution** – such as constructing a Faraday cage or hardened communication device – showcasing an expert level of technical preparedness. By teaching others and innovating new solutions, you solidify your status as an Instructor. _(AP: points for course development, number of members trained, and successful testing of the EMP-hardened gear.)_
