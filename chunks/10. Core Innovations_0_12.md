**Links to FPA Resources:** The **FPA Compass Guide** emphasizes “Knowledge Sharing Culture” – our Compass section on _Collective Learning_ directly led to this innovation【CompassGuide†L10-L18】. Refer to the **Trust Doctrine** which states that _transparency and shared knowledge build trust_【TrustDoctrine†L1-L4】, reinforcing why an open knowledge base is key. For usage, see the **FPA Dictionary** (accessible via the member portal) and the **SOP Index** page which lists all current SOPs (with edit history).  
**(4) Approved Gear List & Endorsements**
**What it is:** A curated **“FPA-Approved Gear” list**, featuring equipment and supplies that have been tested and endorsed by our Alliance for reliability, affordability, and fairness. Think of it as the FPA seal of approval on gear ranging from water filters and first-aid kits to solar chargers and radios. The list is accessible on our site and updated regularly. It not only names recommended products but also includes FPA member reviews, usage tips, and (in many cases) negotiated discounts from the manufacturers for our members. Essentially, we’re providing a **one-stop gear guide** that members can trust, avoiding the trial-and-error (and expense) of sorting through hundreds of options on their own.
