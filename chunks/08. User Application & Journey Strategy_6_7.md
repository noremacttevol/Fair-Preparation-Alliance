- **No leader:** Thanks to succession planning and cross-training, squads don’t collapse if any single person is lost or unreachable ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=reprintable%20pre,blueprint;%20regional%20mentors%20ensure%20consistency-in74e/)). Every user in a squad has clarity on who to look to next, and this is reinforced by the rank system and drills.  
For an FPA member, this robust offline integration means **confidence**: they trust that the fancy features of the app are bonuses, not crutches. The journey teaches them that _preparedness is ultimately about people and plans, not apps_. The technology is used to accelerate learning and coordination while available (“make them faster, tighter, smarter while it lasts”), but every user is conditioned to be effective without it. In internal terms, FPA’s user journey aims to produce individuals and squads that are **software-independent by design**. This is a unique promise of FPA as opposed to typical tech platforms.
