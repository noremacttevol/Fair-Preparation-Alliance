Trust is also maintained by empowering members and expecting ethical conduct at all levels:  
- **Empowerment:** Any member, regardless of rank, has the right (and some might say duty) to question actions that seem to violate our principles. The Trust Doctrine explicitly encourages respectful whistleblowing. If a newbie sees a leader bypassing a safety protocol, they should speak up without fear of retribution. We protect those who raise concerns in good faith â€“ the Tribunal will ensure they are heard and not punished. This flattens the power dynamic in a healthy way: leaders are respected but not beyond reproach, and juniors are encouraged to think critically, not just obey blindly. Over time, this means many potential issues can be caught at early stages by the collective eyes of all members.  
- **No Cult of Personality:** The organization is mission-driven, not leader-driven. We avoid building an environment where loyalty to a person overrides loyalty to principles. This is woven into the Trust Doctrine by emphasizing roles over individuals. If a leader steps down or is removed, the mission continues and members are prepared to carry on with new leadership. Trust is in the **institution and its values**, not in one charismatic figure. This protects FPA from internal fractures or misdirection.
