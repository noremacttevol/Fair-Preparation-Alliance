- **Cultural Messaging:** We are shaping the narrative from the top down that **the mission is saving lives, not collecting badges.** Whenever leadership talks about the Skill Wheel, we frame it in terms of real-world impact. Any time we recognize a member’s achievement, we tie it to how it improves our collective readiness. For example, rather than saying “Congrats on reaching 70% in Navigation!” we might say “Thanks to all that map work, John is now able to confidently guide others during an evacuation – a huge asset to our team.” This constant linking of skills to their practical purpose helps members internalize that the _skill itself_ (and its application) is the reward, not the number. The Trust Doctrine supports this approach by valuing authenticity and cautioning against self-aggrandizement. We will also prepare mentors and leaders to gently correct any signs of unhealthy competition or bragging. For instance, if someone starts boasting about their score, a leader might remind them (perhaps with humor) that “there’s always more to learn” and maybe point out an area they could help others in instead.
