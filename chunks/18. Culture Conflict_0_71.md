After-Action Reviews (AARs): Whenever a significant conflict is resolved, or a major project completes, we conduct an after-action review. In a conflict AAR, for example, the people involved (and possibly some observers like the Trust Liaison) meet to discuss: What happened? What did we do that helped or hurt? What underlying issues contributed? What can we do differently next time? This is done in a blameless way and focuses on process and system, not rehashing personal grievances. The lessons are then fed into the appropriate channel â€“ maybe a change in how we onboard members, or an adjustment to this very framework. By analyzing conflicts after the fact, we avoid repeating mistakes and we refine our conflict handling playbook. Over years, this creates a rich knowledge base within FPA of what strategies work best in our context.
