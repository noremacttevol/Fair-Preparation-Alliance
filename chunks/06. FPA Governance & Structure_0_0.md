_This document is the foundational governance and structure blueprint of the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA). It lays out how we operate, make decisions, and hold ourselves accountable. In essence, it’s our alliance’s guiding framework – both a public-facing summary of who we are and a binding internal reference for how we run things. It integrates principles from our [[Trust Doctrine]], definitions from the [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]], scenario lessons from the [[SHTF Bible]], and strategies from the [[Mk1Mod3 Strategic Plan]]. Written in plain language, this blueprint is meant to be realistic and direct – no-nonsense rules for a no-nonsense mission._
