Governance SOPs: The standard operating procedures for governance detail the formal decision-making processes, committee structures, and possibly disciplinary procedures in FPA. This Conflict & Resilience Framework complements those SOPs. It provides the informal and cultural process around conflicts, whereas the SOPs provide formal mechanisms (like if a member must be formally reprimanded or removed for misconduct, or how a vote is conducted on policy changes). We have integrated lessons from the SOPs, such as clarity in escalation: our framework mirrors the hierarchy of squads -> circles -> movement that the SOPs use for other decisions, to ensure consistency. Also, if a conflict reveals a gap or flaw in our governance (for example, an ambiguous rule that caused confusion), the resolution process should feed back into updating the SOPs. In that sense, governance and conflict-handling are part of one continuous loop of improvement. The framework also adheres to any due process requirements in the SOPs â€“ for instance, if a conflict involves an accusation of misconduct that might require disciplinary action, this framework will guide the interpersonal resolution aspects, but the formal investigation and adjudication would follow the Governance SOP (with this framework ensuring that happens in a fair, transparent manner). We explicitly embed anti-abuse protections (described later) that echo governance best practices like conflict-of-interest management and whistleblower
