- (Optional) **Skills Checklist** – where they can tick any skills they have (first aid, HAM radio, etc.). This helps identify how they might contribute or which squad role fits them.  
These inputs feed into an **AI-powered screening logic** (“FPA Recruit Filter”) that acts as the first gatekeeper ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=,integrity%20of%20the%20fpa%20mission/)). The AI evaluates applications using clear criteria:  
- **Keyword Matching:** The system checks the content of the gear tip and motivation for key preparedness terms. For example, a valid gear tip should mention at least _two_ preparedness-related keywords (water, food, first aid, radio, shelter, etc.). The motivation should include ~3 keywords reflecting FPA’s core ethos (community, resilience, learning, helping, etc.). This ensures the applicant is “speaking our language” and not completely off-base.  
- **Auto-Approval (Green):** If both the gear tip and motivation meet the keyword/common-sense thresholds, the application is auto-approved by the AI. In practice, **most well-intentioned preppers will clear this bar** – it’s looking for basic signs of genuine interest and knowledge. Auto-approved applicants get instant confirmation and proceed directly to onboarding, making the process fast and scalable ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=,waiting%20weeks,%20no%20hidden%20rules/)).
