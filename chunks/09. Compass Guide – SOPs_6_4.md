- **Action-Based Ranking (No Free Riders):** The FPA uses an **Alliance Points (AP)** system to make sure rank progression is tied to real contributions, not popularity or nepotism. We all know talk is cheap – what counts is **doing**. Alliance Points are how we quantify “doing.” Every time you complete a training module, attend a drill, help your squad, contribute a useful idea, or otherwise benefit the community, you earn AP. Hit certain AP milestones (and requisite skills) and you get promoted to the next rank. Why do we do this? Because it motivates continuous engagement and weeds out pretenders. If someone just wants to wear a cool patch but not put in work, they’ll stagnate at E-1 and likely leave. Meanwhile, the person quietly accumulating points by showing up and helping out will rise – and those are exactly the people we _want_ leading. The AP system gamifies things a bit (it’s satisfying to see your points grow), but it’s closely monitored to keep it healthy. Cheating or chasing points for ego won’t get you far; tasks are verified (by peers or evidence), and the culture is very much “we earn these badges to serve, not to brag.” In short, **AP and ranks keep our members accountable**. You’ll always know who has proven experience, and you’ll always know what you need to do to reach the next level. It’s preparation turned into a tangible progression, which keeps it fun but also fair.
