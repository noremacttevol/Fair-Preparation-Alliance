- **Open Communication – On Our Terms:** We encourage open lines of communication with manufacturers and sellers _after_ our independent testing, especially if issues are found. We may reach out to clarify a product’s intended use or to ask if a problem can be fixed. Likewise, vendors are allowed to submit factual information or corrections to specs if our data seems to differ. But all such communication happens in the open: e.g., on public forums or in recorded meetings that are accessible to members. We maintain a **Vendor Transparency Log** (see Appendix A under audit tools) capturing every significant interaction: if a vendor’s engineer explains why a device overheated, or a company offers to replace faulty units, it’s logged for the record. By policy, we do not hold _off-the-record_ private meetings about endorsements. If a vendor isn’t willing to discuss in front of our community, that itself is a red flag.
