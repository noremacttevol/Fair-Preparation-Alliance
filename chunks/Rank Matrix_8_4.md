Finally, **Path** simply denotes whether the rank is part of the Core Enlisted path, the Officer track, or the Prestige option. This makes it clear that Prestige is separate (and only at the E-10 level), and that Officers are on a different fork after the core path. Regardless of path, all members work within the same Alliance and towards the same goals â€“ the pathways just allow for different forms of contribution and leadership.
