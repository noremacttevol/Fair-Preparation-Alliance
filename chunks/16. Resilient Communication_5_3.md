**Resource Support:** To encourage upgrades, FPA chapters can allocate budget or pooled resources to assist members. We recognize not everyone has the means to buy a new solar setup or a high-quality radio. Chapters run equipment swap meets, offer interest-free micro-loans of gear, or allow members to earn gear through service. For instance, volunteering in Alliance community projects might earn credits that can be exchanged for an EMP-hardened radio from the Alliance stock. We also distribute donated equipment – if a sponsor provides, say, a dozen Faraday bags, those might be given out as rewards to the first 12 people who complete a communications drill successfully. The incentive structure is not merely a top-down points game; it’s a mutual aid system where improving one member’s preparedness improves us all. **No tactical waste** – we focus our resources on things that matter (we’d rather subsidize a member’s HAM antenna than see them blow money on another case of ammo they’ll never effectively use).
