**Grounding and Surge Suppression:** In addition to Faraday shielding, proper grounding of antennas and power systems is mandatory for any fixed installation. A well-grounded system gives excess current a safe path to earth, reducing the chances of our devices getting zapped ([Trachte Protects Against EMP Threats - Trachte](https://www.trachteusa.com/blog/trachte-protects-against-emp-threats/#:~:text=,an%20EMP%20is%20to%20have)). Use copper grounding rods and wide braided cables to ground radio antennas, solar charge controllers, generator frames, and even the Faraday cages themselves (when feasible) to a single ground point. This protects against both EMP-induced currents and lightning strikes. All base station radios should have surge protectors or EMP arrestors on their antenna feeds and power lines. These measures won’t make equipment invulnerable to a large EMP, but they greatly increase odds of remaining operational by shunting destructive energy to ground ([Trachte Protects Against EMP Threats - Trachte](https://www.trachteusa.com/blog/trachte-protects-against-emp-threats/#:~:text=,an%20EMP%20is%20to%20have)). **Important:** Keep non-essential gear _disconnected_ from long cables or antennas when not in use – a long wire can act as an EMP antenna. In practice, this means unplugging external antennas from your radios and power cords from the wall during an alert, unless those lines are very short and well-shielded. Our doctrine: _isolate, insulate, and ground_ –
