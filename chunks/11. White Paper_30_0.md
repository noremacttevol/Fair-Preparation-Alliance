**Description:** Develop a secure member verification system (ID cards, call signs, and web-of-trust confirmations) to ensure that each FPA volunteer is authenticated. This reduces the risk of impersonators or bad actors and builds confidence when squads collaborate nationally.
**Real-World Example:** In 2026, FPA issued wallet-sized ID cards with QR codes to all active members. When an out-of-state squad arrived to assist after a tornado, local teams scanned their cards to confirm identities and credentials on the spot, preventing confusion about who was truly FPA.
**Lessons Learned:** Earlier responses saw instances of well-meaning unaffiliated volunteers claiming to be FPA, which created liability and trust issues. The verification rollout taught us to balance security with privacy – minimal personal data on IDs, but enough to validate membership quickly.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Assign each member a unique ID and callsign, recorded in the national registry.  
- Issue physical ID badges and digital certificates (for those with internet) that squads can use to verify newcomers or outside helpers.  
- Implement a simple verification protocol via radio (e.g., challenge-response codes) for when digital methods aren’t available.  
- Train squads on politely verifying credentials during multi-squad operations, making it a standard practice.  
- Periodically audit the member list for inactive or expired credentials and update the registry accordingly.
