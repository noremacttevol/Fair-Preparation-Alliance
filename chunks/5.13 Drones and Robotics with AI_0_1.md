ensuring drones can operate offline with manual overrides, and programming them to come back home if signal is lost. Also, charging and maintaining them is part of gear planning. In drills, they simulate use cases: e.g., using a drone to inspect a route before the group evacuates by foot. The combination of robotics and AI extends FPA’s reach and safety: it’s like having extra team members who don’t get tired or put themselves at risk, doing reconnaissance, delivery, or monitoring. As these technologies become more accessible, the Alliance aims to incorporate them responsibly to further tilt the odds in their favor when confronting disasters.
