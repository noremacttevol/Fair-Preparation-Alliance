8. **Milestone 8: Emergency Contact Sharing and Vulnerable Resident List**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A squad in Illinois learned during a winter blizzard that one of their elderly neighbors lived alone and had no close family – and they hadn’t known. She was found in her cold house, frightened but alive, because a squad member remembered her and trudged over. After that, the squad created a “vulnerable residents” checklist: who in our area might need special attention (elderly, disabled, those on medical devices, single parents with infants, etc.) and who is their emergency contact. This proved life-saving in a later heatwave when they proactively checked on those folks and found two without power who needed immediate cooling and hydration.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ Preparedness must extend beyond just squad members. **Empowerment** in FPA means lifting up the whole community, especially those likely to be left behind. By identifying vulnerable neighbors and planning to assist them, squads fulfill the “fair” part of Fair Prep Alliance. But privacy is a concern – handle this info with sensitivity. **Lesson:** Make sure each vulnerable person is “owned” by someone in the squad (figuratively speaking) – i.e., someone committed to check on them when things go bad. Formalize these buddy assignments in advance.
