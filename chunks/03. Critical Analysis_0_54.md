Spiritual and Existential Dimensions: Preparing for societal breakdown or catastrophic scenarios unavoidably raises existential questions: What do we value when things fall apart? How do we find hope amid destruction? In this sense, FPA isn’t just a technical project; it touches on spiritual resilience. Some members may indeed approach it as part of their spiritual practice (e.g. stewardship of life, service to others). In a post-crisis or collapse scenario, FPA groups might even function akin to how monasteries did in the Dark Ages – as repositories of knowledge, skills, and moral order. They could preserve not only food and tools, but also values and teachings (imagine an FPA manual that also contains a “code of conduct in crisis” – essentially a moral guide). This quasi-spiritual leadership could emerge if official structures crumble. FPA should consider embracing a values framework openly: principles like compassion, courage, and wisdom in crises. These resonate with many religious and philosophical teachings, and could be a unifying spiritual-like element for a secular organization. It could be as simple as starting meetings with a moment of gratitude or ending with a commitment to help one another – small rituals that build communal spirit. In dire scenarios, such elements can provide comfort and meaning, preventing a slide into savagery that some collapse fiction portends.
