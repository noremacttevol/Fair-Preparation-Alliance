aware. Drills and Maps: FPA chapters often distribute maps with routes and rally points marked (securely, to avoid leak). They also practice getting to them (as in [[Drills and Simulations]] bug-out drills). By doing so, they iron out issues (maybe a gate is usually locked at the park at night – plan who has bolt cutters or alternate entry). Post-Rally Next Steps: Once assembled, the chapter can then implement broader plans: maybe travel together to a regional safe zone or coordinate with other chapters. The rally point is a crucial intermediate step that ensures no one is left behind and that resources and information are consolidated. It's a physical manifestation of the Alliance – coming together when it counts. (Cross-ref: [[Emergency Activation Protocols]] which initiate the move to rally, and [[Mutual Aid Among Members]] which heavily relies on successfully rallying to work together.)
