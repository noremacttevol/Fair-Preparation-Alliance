- **No Public Individual Leaderboards:** We consciously avoid any feature that would pit members against each other in a race for points. There will be _no_ “Top 10 Preppers” scoreboard or public ranking of members by their Skill Wheel scores. Competition, if introduced, will be on a group level and purely for fun/cohesion (for example, a friendly inter-squad challenge as mentioned earlier, where squads try to improve together). We do not want a culture of “Bob is rank #1, Alice is #2, Charlie is way down at #50.” Everyone’s context and journey are different. A 40% wheel for a newcomer who has learned a lot in one month is more laudable (and useful to the group) than a 60% wheel for someone who’s been stagnant for a year. Therefore, we focus on **personal progress tracking** (you versus your past self) and team readiness metrics, rather than individual rankings. Removing public individual rankings takes away the incentive to treat the Skill Wheel like a video game high-score chart.
