If no such broadcast is possible because leadership was taken out without warning, then fallback rules apply: after so much time with silence, squads convene and _elect or acknowledge_ a leader among them to serve as coordinator. A leadership signal in that context might be physically raising a distinctive flag or marker at a known point (one Alliance group decided on using green smoke grenade as a signal that “the local council is assuming control” in case of comms outage). More practically, an experienced squad leader will use the radio to hail others: “This is [Callsign] of Squad Alpha. No contact from higher. I am initiating local net coordination. All squads, respond with status.” If others concur, they effectively form a new net with that person as net control pro tem.  
To avoid confusion or power struggles, our doctrine spells out that _in absence of higher command, the senior-most present Phase (ORP) leader among the group should take charge_ – unless/until someone higher comes back. Senior-most could mean highest Phase, or if equal, whoever has been in Alliance longer or whoever has the strongest comms at the moment (some flexibility is allowed if, say, one leader has working long-range radio making them the natural choice to coordinate). The Trust Doctrine emphasizes acting in good faith for the mission, so we expect leaders to coordinate, not compete, in these moments.
