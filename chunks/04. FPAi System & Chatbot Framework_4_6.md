- **Member Feedback & Transparency:** Trust isn’t just top-down; it’s also bottom-up. Every member has the ability to **flag any AI response** that seems wrong or unhelpful ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=%20weekly%20audits:%20human%20reviewers,positives,%20and%20assess%20logic%20drift-2s097j/)). These flags immediately go into a review queue for the moderators and AI team to address. If FPAi told you something inconsistent, you can call it out. We’ve also implemented an **audit log (AI Audit Tracker)** that is visible to members ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=%20transparency%20&%20accountability-2b630f/)). This audit feed shows, in summary, what kinds of decisions or suggestions the AI has made and what the human responses were. For example, it might show: “AI suggested Member X add item Y to their plan – approved by Moderator Z” or “AI answer about topic Q was corrected by an oversight review on DATE.” By giving members visibility into how FPAi’s advice is being used or adjusted, we build real-time trust. Skeptical members (and we _welcome_ healthy skepticism) can literally see that the AI is not acting in a void; it’s working within a transparent, accountable framework ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=the%20fpas%20audit%20tracker%20logs,this%20ensures-sz10d/)). This level of openness is rare in tech, but FPA considers it
