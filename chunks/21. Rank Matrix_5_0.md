The **Officer Track** is an optional path available **after completing E-10**, for those who want to take on formal leadership roles within the Alliance. Officer ranks **O-1 through O-10** correspond to positions of authority overseeing larger groups and missions, from local squad leader up to the national Alliance commander. Unlike the enlisted ranks, which are permanent achievements, officer positions are typically **time-limited appointments or terms** – they are roles one holds while actively leading, often achieved through an election or selection process by one’s peers.  
**Entry into the Officer Track:** To become an officer (O-1), a member must be an E-10 Master and then be **voted into a leadership position**. Usually this means your local group or a committee elects you as a Team or Unit leader. This election by peers serves as validation (a full-member or peer vote) that others trust you to lead. There is no skipping: even the most capable person must first go through all enlisted ranks and prove themselves as a Master before they are eligible to hold an officer post.  
**Progression through Officer Ranks:** Advancing from O-1 up to O-10 is tied to taking on **larger scopes of leadership** and successfully fulfilling those duties. While enlisted ranks were about skill-building, officer ranks are about **command and organizational responsibility**:
