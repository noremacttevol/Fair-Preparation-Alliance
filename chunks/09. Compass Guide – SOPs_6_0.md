Every rule, system, and practice in the FPA exists for a reason. This section explains the rationale behind our key approaches – essentially the “why” of the FPA. Understanding this will help you commit to the program not because someone told you to, but because you **genuinely believe in its logic and purpose**. Here are the cornerstone choices we’ve made and why they matter:  
- **Local Squads for Resilience:** We organize into small squads because in an emergency, _your neighbor is more valuable than a distant expert_. A tight local team can respond faster and more effectively than a large remote organization. Squads build trust – you know exactly who has your back at 3 AM when the floodwaters rise. This cell structure also makes us resilient: even if higher communication fails, each squad can operate independently. It’s the opposite of a top-heavy system. History and disaster research show that community groups save lives long before national aid arrives. FPA squads embrace that truth.
