- Notepad and pen: to leave notes, take info, or communicate if verbal isn’t possible.  
- Key tools: e.g., a small pry bar, or a pair of gloves, depending on one’s daily environment.  
- Protective mask: a foldable N95 or similar, in case of smoke, dust, or biohazards unexpectedly.
FPA’s stance is not to overburden; EDC must be light and feasible to truly carry every day (often it fits in pockets or a small pouch). Members share their EDC setups in meetings, showing clever ways to pack items or multi-purpose uses (a bandana is a common multi-use EDC item: can filter water debris, be a bandage, sun protection, etc.). Importantly, EDC is seen as the first line of preparedness – these items mean a member can survive or assist others for the initial hours of a crisis until they reach more supplies or fellow members. Even when nothing’s wrong, EDC items get used regularly (which is good, as it familiarizes members with them). The Alliance periodically updates an “EDC essentials” checklist reflecting best practices and new small gadgets (like tiny USB rechargeable lights, etc.). By standardizing a bit and promoting EDC, FPA helps each member maintain a constant state of readiness, turning everyday objects into a safety net that’s always within arm’s reach.
