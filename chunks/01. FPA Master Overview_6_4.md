- There is also **ongoing accountability**: officers can be demoted or relieved if they underperform or violate trust, just as in the military. They serve at the pleasure of the Alliance and the members. We’re not about creating a power elite – we’re about filling necessary command roles with the right people.  
- **E-10 (Custom Merit Rank):** In the FPA structure, we’ve reserved a special designation often referred to as **E-10**. This is not a rank you apply for or necessarily progress to in a linear way. It’s more of a **badge of honor** – a custom merit rank for extraordinary service or unique contribution that doesn’t fit the usual ladder. For instance, if a long-time E-9 literally wrote the book on disaster medicine for FPA, and perhaps doesn’t want an officer position, we might award them an honorary “E-10” title (sometimes colloquially called **Alliance Master** or **Chief**). E-10s are our living legends – they hold the same weight as an officer in many respects, but their role is more advisory or inspirational. We don’t hand these out lightly; at any given time there might be only a handful of E-10s in the entire Alliance. It’s a way to **recognize merit beyond the normal scale**.
