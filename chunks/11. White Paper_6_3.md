- Go around and have each person share their motivation for joining and any skills/resources they have. Take note of these openly (whiteboard or notepad).  
- Clearly outline the **immediate goal**: form a core team and schedule regular meetups. Avoid overwhelming newbies with too much planning on Day 1.  
- Collect everyone’s preferred contact info and establish a primary communication channel on the spot (text group, Signal, email list—whatever all are comfortable using).  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If only 1–2 people show up, treat it as a success – you have a core. Document the discussion and reschedule another meeting, asking each attendee to bring one friend next time. If no public venue is available (or safe), utilize a group phone call or video chat as a fallback to get things rolling. Maintain momentum by scheduling the **next meeting** before adjourning the first, even if turnout was small. Low attendance can be improved with personal invites; lack of any meeting will kill the effort entirely.
