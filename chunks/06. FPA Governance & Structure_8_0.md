This **Governance & Operational Blueprint** is the Fair Preparation Alliance’s contract with itself. It spells out how we stay true to our mission and to each other. It’s written to be clear enough for the public to understand what we stand for, and clear enough for insiders to know what rules we play by. If you’re an FPA member, you should see yourself reflected in these pages – the trust you’re given, the trust you owe, and the way we’ve agreed to work together. If you’re outside looking in, you’ll see that we’re serious about doing things differently: less bureaucracy, more action; less hierarchy, more teamwork; less secrecy, more transparency.  
We ground everything here in real-world logic (often learned the hard way from past crises) and a refusal to indulge in corporate or government-style nonsense. The language may be blunt, but that’s because in an emergency, flowery words don’t save lives – solid plans and strong bonds do.  
Going forward, this blueprint will guide **all future FPA policy design, technology development, member training, and leadership decisions.** Our app and tools are being coded with these rules in mind (for example, building in role-expiry timers and dual-auth requirements right into the software). Our training programs quote chapters from here. Our meetings and member debates will cite this document to keep arguments anchored to what we collectively agreed upon. It’s both an operational manual and a moral compass.
