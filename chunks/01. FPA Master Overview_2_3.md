- **No AI, No Shortcuts:** Importantly, Phase1 is **deliberately low-tech**. We rely on **human intelligence and leadership** at every level â€“ from a squad leader relaying a message to a regional coordinator organizing a drill. Why? Because in a true crisis, fancy tools might fail. If we can do it in Phase1, we can do it anytime. This also means decision-making is very human: local councils, team briefings, and on-the-spot judgment calls. **Mistakes are inevitable**, but we correct them fast and move on. By the end of Phase1, the Alliance has a solid backbone: trained people, trusted teams, and proven procedures that work even **with the plug pulled**.  
_By mastering the basics in Phase1, FPA ensures that every member and team can function effectively under worst-case conditions. This phase produces a self-sufficient network built on trust, skill, and **no dependency on technology or outside support**. Only once this foundation is rock-solid do we introduce the next layer of capability._
