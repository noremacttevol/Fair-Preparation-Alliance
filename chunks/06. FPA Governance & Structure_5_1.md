- **Defensive Ownership:** While we share internally, we also make sure **outsiders can’t exploit or sabotage our tools**. The alliance will often copyright or patent certain key inventions **defensively** – meaning we secure the legal ownership _not_ to profit, but to prevent anyone else from locking it away or abusing it. For example, if FPA develops a low-cost water purifier design for disaster relief, we might patent it or publish it openly so no company can patent it and then charge $500 per unit. FPA itself might produce it or partner with an ethical manufacturer, ensuring it’s available at cost to members and communities. If we code an app for offline mesh messaging, we’ll open-source it or at least keep the ownership within FPA to guarantee it stays functional for us even if some vendor goes under. In short, we guard our IP like a community property – **so it remains usable for the community come hell or high water**.
