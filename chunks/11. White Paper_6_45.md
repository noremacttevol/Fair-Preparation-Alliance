- _Contingency Plan:_ If some organizations are initially skeptical or dismissive (“Who are these upstart volunteers?”), don’t be discouraged. It might take time and demonstrated reliability. Continue doing good work in the community – success and word of mouth will eventually get their attention. If businesses want liability assurances (worried about hosting volunteers or storing supplies), consider formalizing the partnership via an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) in simple terms, and highlight the Volunteer Protection Act or local Good Samaritan laws that support volunteer efforts in emergencies. FPA’s transparency principle means you should be clear that you’re not there to usurp anyone’s role – you’re there to fill gaps and support. Once they see that, many will welcome the helping hands.
