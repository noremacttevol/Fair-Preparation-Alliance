FEMA and CERT (USA): The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and its Community Emergency Response Team program illustrate a top-down meets bottom-up approach to preparedness. FEMA sets national standards and provides resources, while CERT empowers local citizen volunteers with training to handle emergencies until professionals arrive. FPA shares CERT’s ethos of community self-help but lacks the governmental mandate and funding. CERT benefits from integration into official response (e.g. using the Incident Command System structure and liability protections). FPA could emulate CERT’s standardized training modules and drills, but it will need to develop these from scratch or partner with programs like CERT. Unlike FEMA, which can mount large coordinated responses to hurricanes or wildfires, FPA would initially be a patchwork of grassroots cells – nimble in their neighborhood, but possibly inconsistent in broader crises. Swiss Civil Protection: Switzerland’s system offers an example of societal commitment to preparedness: by law “a shelter for every inhabitant” exists, totaling about 370,000 bunkers for 9 million places nationwide. Swiss civil defense is comprehensive – combining infrastructure (universal fallout shelters, protected hospitals) with training (citizens serve in civil protection units, similar to military reserve duty). This is an extreme mainstreaming of “prepping” – every household is automatically part of civil defense by virtue of shelter regulations.
