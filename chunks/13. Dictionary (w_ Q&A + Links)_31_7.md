Training materials avoid using language that aligns with any radical movement; they often use FEMA or Red Cross references to show they’re in line with generally accepted practices. Online, moderators of FPA forums quickly quash divisive threads and keep topics practical. They also keep an eye out for infiltration by extremist groups – if they suspect someone is joining FPA to recruit or sway members to some fringe cause, they act on that.
