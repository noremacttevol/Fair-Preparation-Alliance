This Outreach and Mobilization Strategy provides a comprehensive plan for FPA communications before, during, and after emergencies, treating outreach as an essential defensive and mobilizing force rather than mere publicity. By adhering to the principles and protocols outlined – from maintaining a consistent, trustworthy voice to leveraging offline-first technologies and building a cadre of decentralized communicators – FPA will create a resilient network capable of guiding communities through crises no matter the circumstance.  
**Key takeaways from this document:**  
- **Outreach = Survival:** Our communications efforts are integral to saving lives and must be approached with the gravity of a defense strategy. This means continuous effort, verification, and evolution, not one-off campaigns.  
- **Consistent Compass Voice:** All messaging should reflect FPA’s calm, empowering, and honest voice, as guided by the Compass and Trust Doctrine. In unity of voice, we build trust across all channels and phases.  
- **Phase-Specific Strategies:** We operate on a timeline approach – ramping up engagement and education in peacetime, activating robust alternative comms in disaster, and aiding recovery and growth post-disaster. Each phase is distinct but interconnected, ensuring no gap in the communication chain.
