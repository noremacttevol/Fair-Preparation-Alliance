The SOP Compass Guide didn’t appear overnight – it’s the result of extensive development:  
- **Expert Input:** FPA consulted with emergency management professionals (some of whom are FPA members themselves) to align our SOPs with best practices. We cross-referenced CERT (Community Emergency Response Team) guidelines, Red Cross recommendations, and military survival manuals. Where those resources overlapped, we found the common ground and built our procedures there – customizing for community volunteer context. For example, a military manual might assume certain gear (like tourniquets or specific radios) – the SHTF Bible provides civilian alternatives using common items.  
- **Lessons from Mk1Mod2:** We combed through feedback and incident reports from the Mk1Mod2 era. Any time a situation was mishandled or chaos arose, we asked, “Could a better SOP have helped?” Often the answer was yes. For example, during one regional power blackout, some squads didn’t have a clear procedure for neighborhood communication, leading to redundant welfare checks on some homes and missing others entirely. That led us to improve the communication portion of our blackout SOP in Mk1Mod3.
