To ensure that levels correspond to actual ability, Mk1Mod3 has introduced periodic **readiness drills** and evaluations:  
- **Squad Readiness Drills:** Squads perform exercises where each member may be asked to lead a portion of the response or demonstrate a skill. For example, a drill might involve a simulated earthquake aftermath: every member rotates through being the point person for a certain task (communications, triage, etc.). This not only practices the SOPs but lets higher-level members mentor lower-level ones in real time.  
- **Cross-Squad Exercises:** At Chapter level, multiple squads convene for larger simulations (perhaps annually). These might simulate a city-wide disaster where Level 3 and 4 members coordinate. During these exercises, evaluators (usually Level 4s or experienced Level 3s from other areas) observe and later give feedback. They might identify that a Level 2 member is performing at Level 3 caliber and encourage them to pursue the remaining requirements, or conversely that some skills need refreshing.  
- **Skill Refresh and Recertification:** Certain skills, like medical or radio operation, need to be kept current. The ORP includes recommendations for how often to refresh (for instance, take a refresher first aid course every 2 years). While we don’t “demote” people if they lapse, squads keep each other sharp through regular practice. Ultimately, real emergencies are the true test – performance in those will validate a member’s readiness level.
