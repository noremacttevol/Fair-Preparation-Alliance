One key policy is that **a member’s Skill Wheel segment should not decrease without cause.** Skills don’t just vanish overnight, so the system will not arbitrarily lower someone’s percentages unless there’s a reason. However, we will implement reasonable **decay or expiration rules** for certain time-sensitive qualifications. For instance, if your CPR certification expires after two years, the system might deduct a couple of points from your First Aid segment until you renew it. This introduces the concept of **recurring training** to maintain one’s scores, which is common in both military and medical fields. It prevents a situation where someone’s wheel remains full based on training they did a decade ago but might now be rusty at. By Phase3, the AI could actively prompt members when a skill refresh is due – for example, _“It’s been 18 months since your last radio communications drill; consider scheduling another to maintain your Comms proficiency.”_ In short, the system encourages upkeep: if you don’t use it, you _do_ slowly lose it (and you’ll be nudged to refresh it).
