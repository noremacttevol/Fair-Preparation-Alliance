- Another use of E-10: Suppose a member in the field performs a one-off heroic action – like negotiating the peaceful surrender of a violent gang during a crisis, saving dozens of lives. They might already be an E-4, but that single act could be so significant that the Alliance grants them a field promotion to E-10 for commendation. They remain at their official rank for duty purposes, but everyone knows their extraordinary merit has been recognized. In military terms, think of it like a medal that also confers a title.  
- **Alliance Points (AP) Mechanics:** The **AP system** is the quantified backbone of this rank structure. It’s simple at heart: _Do good stuff, earn points._ But we’ve refined it to ensure quality as well as quantity:  
- **Earning AP:** Members earn points for a wide array of contributions. Daily check-in on the app? +1 AP (encouraging engagement). Attend a weekend field training? +10 AP. Complete a certification course in emergency medicine? +50 AP. Lead a squad successfully through a quarterly drill? +100 AP for that leader, and perhaps +20 AP to each squad member. Volunteer significant hours to build out Alliance infrastructure (like helping code the app or organize the gear depot)? AP awarded based on effort and impact. Real-world disaster response under the FPA banner yields big points – if you deploy to assist after a hurricane as part of an FPA team, expect +200 AP or more, plus potential bonus if you held a leadership role during it.
