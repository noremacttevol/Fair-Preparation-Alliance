- If budget allows, get a couple of GMRS radios (slightly higher power and range). Note: GMRS in the U.S. requires a single family license (about $35, no test). One member can get the license and legally share those units among the group under that umbrella. The extended range (a few miles, more with line-of-sight or repeaters ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=Ham%20radio%20,see%20table%20below))) could cover your whole neighborhood.  
- Identify any member interested in HAM (Amateur Radio). Support them in studying â€“ many online resources are free. Having at least one licensed ham means you can reach out farther or integrate with ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service) nets ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=For%20immediate%20emergency%20management%20purposes%2C,aid%20government%20agencies%20and%20nonprofit)). Plan ham integration drills like relaying a message through a nearby repeater or contacting a neighboring squad by ham.
