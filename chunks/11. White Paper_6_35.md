- _Lessons Learned:_ **Practice reveals flaws in a safe setting.** A drill turns abstract plans into muscle memory and identifies what you overlooked (often the small things). It also builds team cohesion and confidence: “We’ve done this before, we can do it again.” The first drill doesn’t need to be large or public – start small. **Lesson:** It’s far better to make mistakes in practice than in reality. Acknowledging failure points openly (transparency) and addressing them is part of FPA’s continuous improvement ethos.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Plan a simple scenario relevant to your top risk. Make it no-notice if possible (announce “drill” at a random time to simulate surprise). Or schedule it if needed for participation, but keep some element unannounced (like details of scenario) so it isn’t too scripted.  
- Assign roles: one or two to act as “controllers” or observers, and the rest as participants. For the first drill, it might be easiest if everyone just responds as they normally would and an organizer tosses in a challenge (“power is out” or “John, you’re injured and can’t move—tell them that when found”).  
- Use whatever gear and communication you would in real life. Treat it seriously – encourage members to _actually_ knock on a neighbor’s door or physically check a “safe house” spot, etc., as scenario demands (with prior permission if involving non-members).
