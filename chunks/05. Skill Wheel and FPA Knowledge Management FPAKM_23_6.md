- _Accountability:_ The doctrine also means holding ourselves and our systems accountable. We intend to constantly validate that the Skill Wheel “walks the talk.” If the system says someone is 80% ready but in a drill they completely choke on a basic task, that’s on us to investigate why the system gave a misleading signal. We plan to set up **feedback loops** such as after-action reviews following real incidents or major drills. In those reviews, we’ll specifically compare outcomes to what the Skill Wheels had indicated. If we find discrepancies (and we expect to find some), we will openly address them and fix the system. For instance, if an after-action report shows that many members struggled with a task despite high scores, we might adjust the scoring or training for that task. Admitting mistakes and improving quickly is how we keep everyone’s trust.  
- _Gradual Introduction of AI:_ The Trust Doctrine likely advises not to impose technology without proving it. By phasing in the AI usage and always keeping a human hand on the wheel (no pun intended), we show respect for members’ trust. Those who are skeptical about an AI evaluating their survival chances will see that it’s implemented carefully, with oversight, and that it’s there to help – not to pass judgment or replace human advice. Over time, as it gives good advice, they’ll warm up to it. In line with the doctrine, we make it clear the AI is a tool _under our control_.
