FPA’s funding is designed to be **fair, transparent, and adaptive** to our growth. We operate on a **Dynamic Pricing Model** for membership dues that ensures we have the resources needed early on, but never become a bloated money-making scheme. The guiding principle: **collect only what’s necessary to sustain the Alliance, and not a penny more**. Here’s how it works:  
- **Initial Membership Fee ($5 flat):** During our formative stage, membership dues are set at **$5 USD** (per member, per month). This nominal fee applies **until we reach 20,000 members**. The $5 is intentionally low – the cost of a fancy coffee – because we want commitment, not financial barrier. It’s enough that everyone has **skin in the game** and we can cover basic operational costs (like maintaining the app, printing manuals, buying comms gear for squads in need) but it’s not so much that it deters anyone serious from joining. Early members get the benefit of a **fixed, low rate** while we build critical mass. And importantly, paying even a small amount creates a psychological investment – you’re more likely to stay involved when you contribute something tangible, even $5.
