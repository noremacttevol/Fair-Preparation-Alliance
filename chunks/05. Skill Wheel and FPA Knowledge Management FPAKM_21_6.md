We will set **milestones and checkpoints** between phases. Notably, we will not advance to Phase3 (full automation/AI) until we have verified that Phase2’s data is solid and that our AI model – tested in pilot – is reliable and aligned with human judgment. According to our AI reliability plan, we’ll likely run the AI in parallel with human evaluation for a period, and only when the AI’s recommendations align well with what human experts would also suggest will we start deploying those AI suggestions to members directly. In other words, we will earn the membership’s confidence step by step, so that by the time the fancy AI stuff rolls out, members trust that it’s been vetted and is there to help, not to experiment on them.
