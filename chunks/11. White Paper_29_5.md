**Contingency Plan:** If a scheduled convention falls during a major crisis (disaster year), we can postpone rather than rush it – survival comes first. If internal disagreements on changes are sharp, and risk splitting the alliance, we might table the most divisive issues for further study instead of forcing them through – maintain unity as a priority. For global integration (Phase 4 perhaps), we may need to transition to an international constitutional process; our national cycle might become a subset of a larger global one. The contingency there is to ensure global additions don’t override national autonomy without careful consideration – basically apply the same philosophy upward. And if technology fails (e.g., the AI tool isn’t available or online voting is down), fall back to analog: mail out proposed changes via post or couriers to squads, gather their written votes. It’s slow, but in matters of core principles, thoroughness beats speed. Ultimately, the bedrock is the Trust Doctrine – even if we couldn’t formally meet, FPA would continue operating by those values as understood, until such time we can convene and adjust formally. No gap in our legalese will stop the mission, but keeping our doctrine up-to-date will only strengthen our resolve and clarity.
