FPA’s operational readiness operates on three integrated components:  
- **Operational Readiness Progression (ORP):** A four-phase activation model (Passive, Prepared, Active, System Override) with a scoring engine that tracks each unit’s status (SOP compliance, communication performance, skill proficiency). The ORP phases are monitored via the FPA app/AI to trigger escalations as conditions worsen (see Section 3).  
- **Three-Tier Readiness Levels:** Parallel readiness checkpoints at the **Personal**, **Squad**, and **Community/Regional** levels. For example, individual members must maintain personal gear (e.g. go-bag checklists and family plans), squads must verify team readiness (e.g. every member’s gear and deployment status, comms rehearsals), and communities/regions must secure broader preparedness (e.g. functioning radio networks and fallback rally plans). Each tier’s readiness contributes to the next – if one layer is weak, the whole system is weaker.  
- **OpCheck (Operational Check):** A final pre-deployment confirmation step. An **OpCheck** is essentially a go/no-go checklist every member or squad must pass before mobilizing for a mission. It confirms all critical readiness items are green-lit (gear packed, comms tested, objectives clear, permissions granted) so that deployments happen only when teams are truly ready.
