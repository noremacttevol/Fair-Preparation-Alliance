are added (see [[3.19 Continuous Improvement]]). It’s a living collection. The vault also has an index or search function to find things rapidly by keyword. In practice, when a situation emerges, members consult the vault as needed: e.g., if a wildfire approaches, someone might quickly open the “Wildfire Action Plan” note to ensure all steps are being followed. By having this knowledge infrastructure, FPA lessens reliance on memory under stress and provides a common operating picture – everyone referencing the same plans and facts. It also greatly aids new members: instead of tribal knowledge scattered in veterans’ heads, much is documented for them to learn from. In summary, the FPA Knowledge Vault is the embodiment of “prepare the mind”: an accessible, well-organized trove of information that can guide the Alliance through known and novel challenges alike.
