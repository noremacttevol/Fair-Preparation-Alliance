- **Mk1Mod3:** Shorthand referring to “Mark 1, Module 3” – in this context it is an internal code indicating this document’s place in the series of FPA’s core manuals. “Mark 1” might refer to the first edition set of Alliance doctrines, and “Module 3” to the Gear & Endorsements section. It’s essentially a versioning/tagging system for our documents. This helps with organization and referencing across updates. (E.g., Trust Doctrine might be Mk1Mod1, Offline Resilience Mk1Mod2, etc.)
