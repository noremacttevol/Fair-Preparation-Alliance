- **AP as Currency for Rewards:** While AP primarily feeds ranks, we also use it as a sort of **internal currency** for certain privileges. For example, we might allow members to redeem some of their AP for gear upgrades (“spend” 100 AP and the Alliance subsidizes 50% cost of a new shortwave radio for you), or for attending special training events. High-AP members also get voting weight bonuses – if you’ve put in work (say you’re E-7 with 3000 AP), your vote in certain internal polls could count more than an E-1’s, reflecting your earned expertise. This is done carefully and mostly for internal leadership elections or technical decisions, to strike a balance between democracy and meritocracy. We disclose when voting weight is applied, keeping it transparent so that lower-AP members understand that it’s not favoritism, it’s **experience** factoring in.
