assist as needed (sterilizing water for cleaning wounds, fetching supplies, etc.). The group might establish a makeshift “sick bay” if needed, and decide collectively how to obtain more medical help or supplies if beyond their ability. Security and Defense: As per [[Physical Security Measures]], mutual defense is a key part of mutual aid. Members coordinate to protect one another’s property and lives. For instance, if looters threatened one member’s home, the others would show up (if feasible) to bolster defenses or help relocate that member to safety. The understanding is that “your safety is my safety” – an attack on one is an attack on all in spirit, because allowing one group to be picked off endangers the rest eventually. Information Sharing: If one member picks up critical information (like a water distribution point the government set up, or a hazard in a certain area), they disseminate it to all. There’s no hoarding of intel; it’s shared promptly via FPA comms so everyone can benefit or avoid danger. Extension to Family: Mutual aid extends to members’ families by default – if you’re a member, your spouse, children, and perhaps close relatives with you are included in the help (even if those family members aren’t active in FPA). This is clarified in membership expectations: by joining, you commit to help others and in return your loved ones are also protected by the Alliance’s umbrella. Limits and Commitments: FPA does discuss practical limits – members are encouraged
