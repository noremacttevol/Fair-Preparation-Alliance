Q4: How is FPA structured? Is it like a military or hierarchical group?
A: FPA isn’t run like a typical top-down organization with rigid ranks. It’s a volunteer-driven alliance. There is a small leadership team (the founders or a council) that handles overall direction and coordination, but most activity happens at the grassroots level. Members often organize themselves locally or online, forming groups to train or share information. Decision-making is cooperative – major guidelines come from the core team, but there’s a lot of autonomy for members to initiate projects or respond to emergencies as needed. There are no military-style ranks; instead, people take on roles based on their expertise (like medical, communications, logistics) or willingness to lead. In short, FPA is structured as a network of peers, guided by shared principles rather than strict hierarchy. [#Beginner] [#Governance]
