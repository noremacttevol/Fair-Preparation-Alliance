**What’s already implemented (current wins):** We’ve made significant strides: at least **one FPA chapter location in every region now has a solar backup system installed**. For example, our Midwest Safehouse runs a 5kW solar array with battery storage – it recently proved its worth during a multi-day grid outage, seamlessly switching to island mode and keeping the lights, comms, and a community fridge running ([Solar and Resilience Basics | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-and-resilience-basics#:~:text=Here%20is%20an%20example%20of,used%20during%20the%20next%20incident)). On the member front, over 100 portable solar kits (100W panel + battery pack sets) were distributed at cost to members as part of our pilot. Those members have been practicing with them, and many reported that during a recent storm-caused outage, their households had lights and device charging thanks to the kits. Another win: the **Solar Knowledge Drive** – we added a suite of solar setup tutorials to our Knowledge Base (covering basics of solar panels, charge controllers, battery maintenance). As a result, even members who can’t afford big installations yet are learning how to make small DIY solar solutions (like solar USB chargers). A huge milestone was the integration of solar into our Outernet radio network (Innovation 7): several radio repeaters now run on solar+battery, meaning our emergency comms won’t fail for lack of power. This program has also forged partnerships; we
