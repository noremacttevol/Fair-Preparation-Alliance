The outcome of Phase 1 is that by the time a serious crisis looms, FPA has a robust foundation: a well-organized membership, trained and equipped, bound by trust and clear plans. Everyone knows their role, their team ([[Buddy Teams and Cell Structure]] might be assigned during this phase), and the triggers that will move the group into Phase 2 mode. Phase 1 could last indefinitely until an emergency hits – FPA operates in this mode continuously, steadily improving. It’s often said within FPA, “Phase 1 is 90% of success”, meaning the work done now determines outcomes later. If done right, Phase 1 ensures that when alarms go off, Phase 2 will activate smoothly like a well-oiled machine. (Preparedness checklists, training logs, and community maps created in Phase 1 are referenced in [[Resource Management and Logistics]] and [[Scenario Planning and Threat Modeling]].)
