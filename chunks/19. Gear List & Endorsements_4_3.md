- **Fraud Detection and Response:** Our integrated systems include safeguards to detect fraudulent behavior. The combination of human oversight and AI analysis watches for anomalies, such as a sudden influx of overly positive reviews from new members (which might indicate a vendor astroturfing with fake accounts) or a member consistently giving high marks to one brand (which might indicate bias). If such red flags arise, the system alerts the Gear Council and **freezes the endorsement process for investigation**. Affected reviews or votes may be temporarily set aside pending verification of those members’ identities and motives. If fraud is confirmed – e.g., a vendor was caught attempting to influence the vote, or a member lied about test results – the response is swift and firm: the offending inputs are discarded, the member or vendor is **publicly called out and banned** from further participation, and the incident is logged for all members to see as a case study in what not to do. Our Trust Doctrine provides a framework for handling these incidents fairly, including the right of accused members to explain (there’s zero tolerance for vendor interference, but a member might have made an honest mistake that can be corrected). The end result is a self-policing ecosystem: members know that **integrity is watched and enforced**, which discourages bad actors from even trying.
