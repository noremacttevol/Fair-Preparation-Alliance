Resilience is at the heart of FPA, and we achieve it by engineering redundancy into every critical aspect of the system. This section details the mechanisms in place to handle system failures or adverse conditions gracefully. The philosophy is simple: **anything that can fail will eventually fail â€“ so we prepare for that failure in advance**. Our resilience strategy covers technology, communication, power, data, and even leadership.
