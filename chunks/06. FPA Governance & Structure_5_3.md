- **Transparency and Credit:** Just because we hold IP collectively doesn’t mean individual creators go uncredited. In fact, we make it a point to acknowledge who worked on what and to ensure contributors are recognized. If you design a great emergency medical protocol, the “FPA Dictionary” or manual will note your contribution. But you understand that by contributing, you’re donating it to the alliance’s commons. This builds a culture of pride and shared purpose rather than mercenary motives. We also keep our IP use transparent: members can see how any funds related to our products (say we do take donations for printed copies of a handbook) are used to further the mission, not to line anyone’s pockets.
