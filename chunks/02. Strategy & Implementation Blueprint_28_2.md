In summary, the Trust Doctrine is not a single thing but an ecosystem of **culture and structures**: from the Tribunal that watches the watchers, to the firewall that guards against digital missteps, to logs that let light shine everywhere, to a culture where every member has voice. Together, these ensure that **the FPA remains worthy of the trust people place in it**, which is ultimately what will keep the organization cohesive and effective through adversity.
