26. **Milestone 26: Expand Membership and Diversity**  
- _Real-World Example:_ After a year, a squad noticed most of their members were middle-aged homeowners, but the nearby apartment complex (mostly renters, many immigrants) had no representation. Realizing disasters don’t care about ownership or language, they made an effort to recruit from that complex – posting flyers in Spanish and Mandarin (with help from a bilingual teen) and scheduling a meeting there at a convenient time. They gained several new members, including a young mom and a retired mechanic, both of whom brought fresh urgency and skills. In another case, a squad that started with 5 people grew to 30 over two years simply by each member bringing a friend and by public demonstration of their value (people saw them in action during a storm cleanup and wanted to join).
