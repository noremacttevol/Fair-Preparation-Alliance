By the end of the Enlisted core path, an FPA member is a well-rounded **preparedness expert**. They have not only prepared themselves and their family, but have also led teams, mentored others, engineered solutions to problems (like EMP protection), and run community-level initiatives. An E-10 Master is respected as a veteran member who can be trusted in any emergency and who actively lifts others up. This is the launching point for either taking on higher leadership responsibilities or pursuing specialized contributions through the post-enlisted forks described next.
