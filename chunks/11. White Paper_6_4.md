3. **Milestone 3: Define Squad Purpose and Values**  
- _Real-World Example:_ A newly formed flood-response squad in a low-income borough drafted a simple mission statement: “We neighbors band together to prepare, rescue, and recover – **no one left behind**.” This clarity helped unify members who otherwise had diverse backgrounds and agendas. When a flash flood hit months later, everyone knew their squad’s role: check on vulnerable residents, share supplies, and relay information to all.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ Early on, explicitly agree on what the squad is **and isn’t**. It prevents conflicts down the line. Are you focused on disaster response only, or also on general community service? Decide how you align with FPA’s core values (decentralization, transparency, empowerment). **Lesson:** A team charter or mission, even if informal, guides decision-making and brings cohesion. It also signals to outsiders (like officials or potential funders) that you’re serious and organized.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- In a meeting, draft a short mission statement collaboratively. Aim for 1–3 sentences that any member can memorize and recite.  
- List the key values that will shape your work (e.g. “neighbor helping neighbor,” “self-reliance,” “share openly,” “safety first”). These can mirror FPA’s broader principles but make them your own.
