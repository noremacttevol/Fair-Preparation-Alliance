Secret Sharing). The Alliance tests its backups – e.g., during a drill, simulate that the main coordinator’s laptop is destroyed and see if another member can bring up the vault from their backup successfully. Redundancy also applies to knowledge sources: they try to have overlapping info from multiple places. For instance, first aid knowledge might be in a Red Cross manual, a military field manual, and a home medicine book – losing one still leaves others. The attitude is “two is one, one is none” for information, just as with gear. By treating data with the same care as food or tools, FPA ensures that even if their operations center is hit or a malicious actor targets their files, the lights of knowledge stay on. This information resilience is key to long-term survival and rebuilding, since a group with knowledge can improvise and recover much faster than one without.
