- _Lessons Learned:_ **Know your turf.** This is practical empowerment: you don’t wait for authorities to tell you what’s important in your neighborhood – you find out and own that knowledge. Visualizing hazards and resources on a map (even a hand-drawn one) is far better than vague ideas. **Lesson:** By pre-identifying choke points, shelter spots, and danger zones, your squad can act decisively under pressure. This localized intelligence is something outsiders won’t have, which is exactly why local squads matter.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Obtain or draw a map of your area. This could be a large printed Google map, a hand-sketched layout of the streets, or using a tool like OpenStreetMap if tech allows. Define your core “operational area” (e.g., our apartment complex, or our 4-block radius, or our village).  
- Mark hazard-related features: flood-prone areas, tall old trees that might fall, wooden structures (fire risk), industrial sites (chemical hazard?), etc. Use different colored markers or symbols. If you’re not sure, talk to longtime residents for historical insight (“that alley always floods first” or “that hill had a landslide in ’98”).  
- Mark resource-related features: water sources (well, community pump), potential shelter buildings (church, school, sturdy hall), medical facilities (clinic, pharmacy), and known supplies (hardware store, food markets). Also mark squad member homes and the vulnerable residents identified in Milestone 8.
