A standout feature of the AI analysis is how it accounts for **regional threats and context**. When a member joins, their profile will include at least a general location or environment type (e.g. coastal, urban, suburban, wilderness). We do **not** need precise coordinates – just enough context to personalize the risk profile. FPAi uses this context to weight the importance of certain skills for that member. For example, **Navigation** might be absolutely critical for someone living in remote Montana (where getting lost could be fatal and help is far), but slightly less critical for someone in Manhattan (where navigation mostly involves knowing evacuation routes and public transit, and one is rarely far from help). Conversely, **Communications** and community coordination skills might be weighted more heavily for an urban member who would need to coordinate with neighbors and authorities in a crisis. The system thus provides **contextualized feedback** – making training recommendations far more relevant than any one-size-fits-all program. Moreover, if a member moves or if threat patterns change over time (say wildfires become more frequent in their area), the AI can dynamically adjust the learning path and threat assessment for that member.
