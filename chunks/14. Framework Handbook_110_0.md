FPA categorizes gear into **tiers** corresponding to the level of scenario or duration of self-sufficiency the gear supports. This helps members prioritize purchases in stages and ensures their equipment aligns with their readiness level (Chapter 6). The tiers are:  
|**Gear Tier**|**Preparedness Scope**|**Examples**|**Purpose/Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Tier 1** – 72-Hour Kit|Short-term emergencies (up to 3 days). Often called a “Go-Bag.”|Basic first aid kit; flashlight + extra batteries; portable phone charger; whistle; dust masks; 3 days of water (bottles or pouches) & non-perishable food (energy bars, MREs); multi-tool or pocket knife; emergency blanket; lighter/matches; a hand-crank or battery radio; copies of IDs & important documents (USB or laminated); personal medications.|**Goal:** Grab-and-go kit covering essentials if you must evacuate or get through a few days without services. Tier 1 is lightweight and portable, ideally one backpack per person. FPA emphasizes assembling this first – it’s the foundation for personal preparedness.|
