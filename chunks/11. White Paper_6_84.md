28. **Milestone 28: Document Best Practices & SOPs (Compass Guide Integration)**  
- _Real-World Example:_ As one of the first FPA squads, the Elm Street team kept a journal of what they did – what worked, what failed – effectively a living SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) document. They used it to brief new members and even shared it with FPA organizers, some of which made it into the official **Compass Guide** as case studies. Another squad created checklists for common scenarios (flood response, blackout response) and put them in a binder at their base. During a major blackout, even less experienced members could open the binder and follow the checklist (“Step 1: set up info board and lighting; Step 2: check on vulnerable list; Step 3: deploy generator to community center,” etc.), which kept things orderly. These writings became part of the knowledge transfer when transitioning leadership to the next generation.
