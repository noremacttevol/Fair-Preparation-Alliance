- Testing the AI on known scenarios (did it give the correct advice?),  
- Monitoring its suggestions for errors or biases,  
- Setting thresholds for when it should defer to humans. For example, if an AI’s confidence in an answer is low or it’s a life-critical question, it will not give an answer directly but instead say, “Let’s get a human expert on this.”  
- Regularly updating the AI’s knowledge. The AI is fed with our own validated data (like results from gear testing, new SOP changes, recent lessons learned from drills) – this keeps it relevant. We do **not** allow the AI to just pull in arbitrary internet data on the fly, because that could undermine reliability and trust. Instead, new data sources are vetted and added deliberately (like feeding it a new government guideline or research finding after human review).
