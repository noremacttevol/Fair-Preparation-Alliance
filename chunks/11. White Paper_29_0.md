**Description:** Institutionalize a regular cycle for reviewing and updating FPA’s guiding documents – such as the FPA Constitution/Charter and the Trust Doctrine – to incorporate lessons learned and adapt to new challenges (like technologies or geopolitical changes) while maintaining core principles. This includes scheduling a “constitutional convention” at set intervals (e.g., every 2 years) where proposals are debated (aided by AI analysis for consistency), then put to a member vote. The aim is to keep the alliance’s foundation documents living and relevant, and to reaffirm our values in a changing world, preventing stagnation or drift from our original mission.
