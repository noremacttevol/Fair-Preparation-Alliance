- **Medicine and first aid:** If you or family members rely on prescription meds, try to maintain a small emergency reserve (even 3-7 days extra can be lifesaving – ask your doctor for a 90-day prescription or use mail-order which often gives a buffer). Keep a stocked first aid kit and include common OTC meds (pain relievers, anti-diarrheals, etc.). Many items can be acquired cheaply at generic brands. Check kits every 6 months for expired items.  
- **Emergency power & light:** At minimum, have a way to light your home and charge basic devices. Flashlights and headlamps with spare batteries are non-negotiable. You can get decent LED flashlights for $5; get a few. Store batteries in a cool, dry place (and consider a small solar charger or hand-crank flashlight/radio to reduce dependency on batteries). If you can afford, a small solar panel and battery bank (many kits under $100) can keep phones, radios, or medical devices running; otherwise, focus on battery-operated solutions. Candles and kerosene lamps are old-school options but come with fire risk – use with caution and never leave unattended.
