- **Squad Autonomy & Self-Management:** The core of Phase3 is that **squads function as independent, resilient units** of the FPA, guided by a shared framework:  
- **Standardized Squads with Leader Succession:** Every squad operates under the **“New Squad Blueprint”** – a standard SOP that was introduced in Phase2 and proven out ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=all%20ai%20insights%20printable;%20offline,votes%20remove%20inactive;%20day%20zero-mn31f/)). This blueprint covers roles (leader, comms officer, quartermaster, etc.), meeting cadence, drill schedules, and even succession plans (each squad has a second-in-command and an emergency chain of command). Regular **“Leader Down” drills** ensure if a squad loses contact with its leader, another member can step up seamlessly ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=reprintable%20pre,blueprint;%20regional%20mentors%20ensure%20consistency-in74e/)). This means the user journey for a squad leader includes mentoring their deputy; for a regular member, it means being prepared to take on responsibility if needed. It’s a mature culture of shared leadership.
