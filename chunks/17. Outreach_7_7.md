- **Physical Signals & Community Messaging:** In some scenarios, even printing might not be enough â€“ say a fast evacuation is needed. FPA encourages communities to establish **analog signaling systems** as part of preparedness. For example, some towns might use volunteer bike messengers (as was done in some disasters historically) to relay messages if fuel is scarce. Others might designate a church bell or siren for certain signals (one kind of ring for fire, another for flood). Our outreach before events helps set these up, and during the event, we remind and utilize them. A concrete example: If the phone network is down and an area must evacuate due to a secondary threat (like a compromised dam post-earthquake), our local FPA team might ring the church bell in a pre-agreed pattern and use megaphones to direct people, because that may reach more people than trying to text everyone.
