Section Summary: FPA operates in a landscape of stakeholders that may not all be friendly. By anticipating who might want to impede the alliance (and why), FPA can take measures to protect itself. Cooperative posture toward government, strict neutrality and transparency to fend off partisan or corporate capture, strong internal governance to keep extremists out, and legal precautions for liability will all fortify FPA against disruption. In many ways, how FPA handles these threats will determine if it remains a benevolent community network or gets entangled in external conflicts. A prudent motto for FPA could be “Strengthen communities, not oppose institutions,” keeping its focus on constructive action that is hard to demonize or forbid.  
Psychological, Memetic, and Spiritual Implications  
Beyond the tangible, the FPA project carries profound psychological, memetic, and even spiritual implications for individuals and communities – both in steady-state operation and especially in post-crisis scenarios. Understanding these can help FPA refine its approach and gauge its broader impact on society’s psyche.
