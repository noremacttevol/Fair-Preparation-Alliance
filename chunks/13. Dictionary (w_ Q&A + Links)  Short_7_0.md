1. **Note weight** – This single file is intense; next sprint may split tier snapshots.  
2. **Answer brevity** – Hit 6‑20 words; confirm clarity with user feedback.  
3. **Citation granularity** – Many short answers boil down to doctrine summaries; may add specific page cites later.  
4. **Index integrity** – Anchor tags presumed; verify after final import to Obsidian.  
5. **Glossary duplication risk** – Keep glossary edits synced across other notes.
