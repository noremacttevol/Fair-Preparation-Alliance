**Description:** Form an **Outernet Content Team** tasked with curating, preparing, and uploading information for broadcast over the Outernet network. This team acts as the brain behind the data: deciding what each daily (or emergency) transmission contains, ensuring accuracy and timeliness, and interfacing with external information sources (like weather services or relief agencies). A dedicated content team transforms Outernet from a tech gimmick into a life-saving information service tailored to FPA’s needs.
**Real-World Example:** By 2026, the FPA Outernet Content Team – a mix of volunteer analysts and retired emergency managers – was operating out of a spare room in Kansas (and virtually). When spring floods hit the Midwest, they quickly assembled a packet: river gauge readings, a Red Cross clean water guide, and an updated list of county evacuation orders, beaming it down to all affected regions. An FPA member in rural Iowa, without power or phone, recalled receiving that info via a small satellite kit: “It was like a news broadcast just for us, telling us exactly what we needed to know.”
