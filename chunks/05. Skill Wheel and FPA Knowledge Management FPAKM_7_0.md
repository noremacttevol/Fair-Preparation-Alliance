The **Projected Survivability Score** is an AI-generated metric estimating a member’s likelihood of surviving various disaster scenarios given their current skill profile (and assuming they utilize FPA’s support and resources). FPAi calculates this by considering the member’s Skill Wheel – their strengths and weaknesses – _and_ factoring in **regional threat profiles** specific to that member’s environment. For example, a member living in a coastal hurricane zone will be evaluated against the skills needed for hurricanes and flooding, whereas a member in an earthquake-prone region will be evaluated for earthquake preparedness. The survivability score might be presented as an overall percentage (and possibly also broken down by scenario type).
