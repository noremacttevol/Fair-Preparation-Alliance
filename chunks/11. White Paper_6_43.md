- _Lessons Learned:_ **No squad is an island.** Tapping into established NGOs (like Red Cross, Salvation Army, local food banks, etc.) multiplies your effectiveness. They often have resources and training that can augment your low-budget operations. Likewise, local businesses can be crucial allies – they have infrastructure and supplies that might be repurposed in emergencies. Transparency and goodwill go a long way: by openly explaining your squad’s aims, you invite trust and support. **Lesson:** Build these bridges _before_ you need them. In a crisis, you don’t want to be introducing yourself for the first time.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Identify key NGOs and community organizations around: Red Cross, Community foundations, places of worship with relief missions, volunteer fire companies, etc. Reach out with a polite introduction: a short email or phone call explaining the FPA squad and suggesting a meeting or attendance at one of their events.  
- Offer to support their initiatives (volunteer at a charity drive, help a church distribute food boxes). By helping them, you both do good and show that your squad is a responsible community player and not just out for itself.
