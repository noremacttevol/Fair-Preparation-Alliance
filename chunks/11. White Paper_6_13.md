- Identify other essential courses: First Aid/CPR (often free or low-cost through Red Cross or local clinics), basic firefighting (some fire departments offer community fire extinguisher training), and **IS-100 and IS-700** (FEMA’s intro to Incident Command System and National Incident Management System). These independent study courses are free and online – assign them as “homework” with a flexible deadline.  
- Organize low-cost group training if possible: for example, invite a local nurse to teach a “Stop the Bleed” workshop at a community center, or a veteran to demonstrate emergency shelter building. Leverage willing experts in your community for mini-courses.  
- Track who has completed which training in a simple roster. Recognize and celebrate these achievements (even if just a shout-out in a meeting) – it keeps motivation up. Equip trained members with any low-cost identifier (like a colored armband or cap during drills) so everyone knows who can do what in a pinch.
