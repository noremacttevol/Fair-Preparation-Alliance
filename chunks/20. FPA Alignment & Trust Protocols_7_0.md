All trust interactions are logged and tracked through visible metrics:  
- **Transparency Index** – Measures what % of leadership roles have visible logs and audits  
- **Responsiveness Score** – Tracks how quickly squads and leaders respond to reported incidents  
- **Patch Log Volume** – Records all violations and how fast they were resolved. More is not bad—slow responses are.  
These scores are viewable to all members ranked E-2 or higher on the [[Trust Dashboard]] in the app and in squad reports.
