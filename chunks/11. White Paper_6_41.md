- Pair up members so that each expert teaches at least one other person their skill. For example, the Comms Lead spends a session with a couple of others showing how to set frequencies on the handheld radio and proper radio etiquette. The medically inclined member teaches others how to splint an arm or do a patient assessment.  
- Integrate role rotation into drills: explicitly assign people to roles outside their comfort zone during scenarios. One drill, have someone else act as Incident Coordinator, another person handle first aid who normally wouldn’t, etc. Supervise so that mistakes become learning moments safely.  
- Encourage “ride-alongs” or shadowing: if a member attends a specialized training or event (say one attends a Red Cross seminar), have them bring another squad member or at least share the knowledge after.  
- Track cross-training progress. Ideally, aim for at least two people competent in each key skill. If you have enough members, three is better (redundancy!). This way, no single failure point exists in your human resource structure.
