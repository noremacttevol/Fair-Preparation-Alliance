Organizational Structure & SOPs: This team defines how we organize ourselves. Core Coordination maintains the squad–platoon–company hierarchy and ensures every member is accounted for in the chain of command. They issue and update the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that everyone follows. SOPs cover everything from how to file a situation report to how to request resources or escalate a problem up the chain. The tone is deliberately direct and tactical – minimal bureaucracy, just clear steps. And they’re not static documents; if something isn’t working (say a drill revealed confusion due to unclear orders), Core Coordination will quickly revise the SOP or tweak the structure to fix it. They’re obsessive about eliminating friction and ambiguity. They’ll cut redundant steps, flatten hierarchy if needed or tighten it if control is lacking – whatever makes us more effective and agile.
