so in a way that does not expose or dilute the Alliance. As FPA moves into Phase 3, outreach becomes more open, with [[Outernet (Phase 3 Media Layer)]] and possibly public-facing initiatives to aid reconstruction ([[Rebuilding and Recovery Planning]]), but even then, the distinction between FPA’s internal network (the “Realnet/Real network”) and its public outreach is maintained. Members are coached on what they can share publicly and what stays internal ([[Public Outreach and OPSEC in Communication]]). This careful balancing act allows FPA to maintain good public relations and partnerships without losing its core identity or security. (Related: [[Alliances and External Coordination]] for operational collaboration details, and [[Public Image and Perception Management]] regarding how FPA is viewed externally.)
