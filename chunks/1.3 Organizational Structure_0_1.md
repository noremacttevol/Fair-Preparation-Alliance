also includes functional teams or committees across the network for special areas – for instance, an AI oversight committee (see [[AI Oversight and Ethics Guidelines]]) or a communications network team (overseeing [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] and radio nets). Overall, FPA’s structure is relatively flat and decentralized, avoiding bureaucracy to remain agile. It is built to endure crisis conditions: if central coordination goes down during an SHTF event, local chapters can still function effectively and support one another, thanks to this robust yet flexible structure.
