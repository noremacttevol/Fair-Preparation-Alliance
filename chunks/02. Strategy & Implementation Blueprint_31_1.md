- **Approval Process:** For any patch or new version, there’s an approval workflow. Small changes (typos, clarifications) can be made by the committee in charge (with logging). Larger changes (altering a strategic objective, adding a new Trust principle, etc.) require broader approval – possibly a Tribunal sign-off and even a membership vote if it touches the core mission or member rights. We define these thresholds clearly. The Living System Clause might specify that anything affecting the Trust Doctrine, for example, must get supermajority support from all members because trust is paramount.  
- **Communication of Changes:** When changes are made, they are communicated clearly to all members, with both **what** is changing and **why**. If a new SOP is introduced or an old one revised, squads are briefed and often a drill will be run specifically to practice the new procedure. If the app gets an update, the release notes are explained not just in technical terms but how it benefits the members. We don’t do silent, mysterious updates – every update is an opportunity to reinforce trust (by showing improvements and honesty about fixes) and to retrain or inform everyone to stay on the same page.
