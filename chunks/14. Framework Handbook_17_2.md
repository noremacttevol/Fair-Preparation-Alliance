**Training and Drills:** Squads frequently train together, which not only builds skills but reinforces the team dynamic. A typical squad drill might simulate a night-time power outage: members practice setting up a generator and lights, establishing radio comms, and rotating security watch. Another drill could be a medical emergency scenario, where the Medic leads a response to a simulated injury and other members practice their supporting roles. These exercises highlight the importance of each role and reveal any weaknesses (e.g., if the comms radio wasn’t charged, everyone learns to keep it ready). Under Mk1Mod2, some groups trained individually; Mk1Mod3 emphasizes team drills to ensure interoperability of skills under stress.  
**Flexibility:** While roles are defined, Mk1Mod3 preaches flexibility. If a situation demands it, people will step outside their normal lane – and that’s fine. The doctrine is “know your role, but be ready to adapt.” For example, if the squad Medic is busy treating someone and another person gets hurt, anyone with the knowledge should start first aid rather than waiting. The structure exists to provide clarity and readiness, not to create rigid silos.
