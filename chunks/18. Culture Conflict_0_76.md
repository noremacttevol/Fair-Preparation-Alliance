Expected Outcomes: By focusing on continuous learning, we expect that over time conflicts will become less frequent and more swiftly resolved, because the organization itself gets smarter and more mature. Issues that in early years might have caused big fights could in later years be anticipated and prevented thanks to the improved systems we’ve put in place. This does not mean we seek zero conflict – as noted, some conflict is healthy and inevitable – but we aim for a culture where conflict never threatens our cohesion because we’ve seen it all before and handled it. Essentially, we are “hardening” the Alliance with each challenge.  
Failure Modes: One risk is complacency – thinking we’ve solved conflict forever. That would be dangerous; the environment changes and new forms of conflict can arise. Our antidote is the institutionalized reflection and amendment process that keeps us vigilant. Another risk could be data misuse: if our conflict repository is not handled with care, it could violate privacy or become a gossip archive. We mitigate this by strong anonymization and limiting access, focusing on aggregate learning not individual dirt. Also, while learning from conflict, we must not over-correct by imposing too many rules after one incident (avoid knee-jerk reactions that add bureaucracy). That’s why we deliberate on changes in a measured way, possibly waiting to see a pattern before major policy shifts. Balance is key.
