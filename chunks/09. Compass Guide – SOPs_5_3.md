**Roles and Ranks:** To make this work, FPA uses a **ranking system** for members, similar to how the military or Scouts use ranks to denote experience and responsibility. Don’t let this intimidate you – ranks in FPA aren’t about bossing people around; they’re about recognizing who has put in the work and who can lead when needed. Every member starts at **E-1** (Entry Level 1) upon joining. As you train and contribute, you earn promotions through E-2, E-3, and so on, up to E-9 (the highest enlisted rank, usually national leaders). Above E-9 there is an **Officer tier** for those who take on executive leadership roles, but that comes into play only as the alliance grows into later phases. For now, most members will progress through E-1 (novice) up to around E-5 or E-6 (local leadership). We’ll cover more on ranks and the **Alliance Points (AP)** system that drives promotions later. The main idea is that rank isn’t about ego – it’s a measure of trust and contribution. Higher-ranked members mentor others and assume more responsibilities; new members focus on learning and following guidance. The system is meant to be **meritocratic and transparent** – if you do the work, you will advance.
