A hallmark of the FPA strategy is that **trust and culture** are intentionally woven into the user journey, rather than handled separately. The application and onboarding process is not just a funnel for users, but a **filter and forge** for community values. Likewise, the **member progression system** reinforces the culture by rewarding alignment and participation. Below are the key integration points:  
- **Application as a Culture Gate:** The initial application itself is designed to screen for values. By asking for a gear tip and motivation (Phase2 onward), we signal that FPA expects effort and a certain mindset from day one. An applicant who writes _“I tested my generator last weekend”_ shows hands-on mentality, whereas someone who writes nothing or something irrelevant is showing misalignment. The explicit **“Not Allowed”** list (violence, political rants, etc.) is communicated up front in public-facing guidelines, and the review process filters those out. This means the very _composition_ of the member base is curated to fit FPA’s apolitical, constructive culture. Early members then set the example for newcomers.
