Logging also reduces confusion: if someone thinks a message might not have gotten through, the comms person can confirm from the log whether it was transmitted and acknowledged. At the end of an event, these logs help in debriefings to reconstruct what happened. Ultimately, maintaining a written or typed record means the group isn’t relying purely on memory in a chaotic scenario – there’s a paper trail (digital or physical) of what was communicated, which is invaluable for accountability and learning.
