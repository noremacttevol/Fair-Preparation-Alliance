Like other aspects of Mk1Mod3, the offline-first systems have been tested in drills:  
- **Grid-Down Drills:** Squads conduct exercises where they simulate a total communications blackout. They practice passing messages via ham radio only, or use the mesh chat app to coordinate a task, all while mains power is turned off (running on solar/battery). These drills expose weaknesses – maybe a certain house’s solar panel is shaded too much or a mesh node’s range is insufficient. Then they tweak the setup according to the blueprint’s recommendations (perhaps raising an antenna higher, or getting a better battery).  
- **Event Deployment:** FPA also volunteers at planned events (like a large public marathon or a festival) to set up off-grid comms in support of organizers. This is a win-win: it provides extra safety for the event and gives FPA folks a chance to deploy and practice their gear in a non-emergency setting. For instance, an FPA mesh network might be used to track runners at checkpoints in a marathon where cell coverage is bad – a very similar setup to what we’d use in a disaster, just different purpose. These experiences help refine the blueprint: making sure our solutions are user-friendly and robust.
