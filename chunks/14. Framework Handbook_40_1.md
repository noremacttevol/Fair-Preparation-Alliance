- **Peer-to-Peer Mesh:** In the digital domain, the blueprint introduces a local mesh networking system. Using technologies like Wi-Fi Direct, LoRaWAN, or dedicated mesh devices (e.g., goTenna or meshtastic modules), squads set up networks that allow devices to connect to each other without central infrastructure. Imagine a daisy-chain of nodes (phones, routers running special firmware) that pass messages along – even if one node goes down, the message routes around via others. FPA has experimented with community Wi-Fi mesh in neighborhoods: small wireless routers (often repurposed, with open-source firmware) are installed at members’ homes, forming a web of connectivity. In normal times, they might just carry benign local traffic; in a crisis, they automatically switch to emergency mode, carrying text messages, VoIP calls, or sensor data within the community network. If at least one node in the mesh still has an internet connection (say via a generator-powered modem or a satellite link), it can share that with others. And if there is no internet connection, a mesh network can still operate to provide emergency information and basic messaging services, like texts.
