Q23: What is an MRE and why do preppers use them?
A: MRE stands for “Meal, Ready-to-Eat.” It’s a self-contained prepackaged meal originally developed for the military, but many preppers use them too. An MRE includes an entrée and various sides (like bread or crackers, peanut butter or jam, dessert, and a powdered drink mix) all sealed in durable packaging. They often come with a chemical heater pouch that lets you warm the meal without fire – you just add a little water to activate it. MREs are designed to have a long shelf life (several years) and provide a lot of calories. The advantage is convenience: you can eat them straight out of the pouch, no cooking needed. On the downside, they can be bulky, a bit expensive, and not everyone loves the taste. They’re useful for emergencies when you need ready-to-eat, non-perishable food. [#Beginner] [#Logistics]
