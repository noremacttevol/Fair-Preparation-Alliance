A. Safeguards Against Process Abuse  
No Retaliation Policy: Central to all our processes is the guarantee that no one will be punished or disadvantaged for raising a concern or participating in a conflict resolution in good faith. Retaliation – whether overt (like demoting someone for complaining about their supervisor) or covert (social ostracism, cutting someone out of information loops) – is strictly prohibited. Any evidence of retaliation is itself treated as a serious violation of trust and subject to discipline. Members are informed of this protection, and multiple reporting routes (including anonymous) exist if they suspect retaliation. The presence of a strong whistleblower process means members can report retaliation or other abuses to an impartial body, which will investigate and protect the reporter. This encourages people to use the conflict resolution channels without fear, which is fundamental for them to be effective.
