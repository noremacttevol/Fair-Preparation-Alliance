- **Alliance-Friendly Vendor:** A designation for companies or sellers who have shown good ethics and cooperation with FPA’s processes without trying to influence outcomes improperly. It is _not_ an endorsement of all their products, but a note that they are trustworthy in business practices (fair pricing, honoring warranties, etc.).  
- **Panic-Bait:** A term used to describe language or marketing that tries to scare people into buying something. FPA avoids this, focusing instead on rational, fact-based reasoning for preparedness.  
- **Bulk-Buy / Group Purchase:** An organized effort where multiple FPA members combine orders to purchase gear in volume, often to receive a discount. Facilitated by the Alliance to ensure fairness (everyone pays the same cost price) and reliability (dealing with known vendors).  
- **OpSec (Operational Security):** The practice of protecting information that could be used against you. In FPA context, this might mean keeping certain details (like exact locations of caches or personal stockpiles) restricted to need-to-know. It’s why we have visibility tiers – some info is kept within squads for OpSec.
