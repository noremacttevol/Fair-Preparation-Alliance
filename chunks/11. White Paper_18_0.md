**Description:** Link the FPA’s two major communication channels – the HAM radio network and the Outernet broadcast – into a cohesive system. This means developing procedures for cross-utilization: important information received via HAM (like a distress call or resource offer) should be packaged and sent out on Outernet for wide awareness, and critical Outernet bulletins (like weather alerts) should be echoed on HAM for those actively on the radio. Integration ensures no matter which channel a member is monitoring, they won’t miss vital news, creating redundancy and greater reach.
**Real-World Example:** During a 2026 national drill, FPA Region 7’s relay operator received a HAM message about a hypothetical dam failure affecting multiple downstream squads. He immediately forwarded this to the Content Team, who included it in the next Outernet update marked “URGENT.” Within an hour, even squads that hadn’t heard the original radio call saw the alert on their satellite feed and mobilized accordingly. Conversely, when the Outernet issued a midnight tornado warning for two counties, the relay squads in those areas woke up their local nets and broadcast the warning via HAM to ensure everyone (even those without a receiver) got the heads-up.
