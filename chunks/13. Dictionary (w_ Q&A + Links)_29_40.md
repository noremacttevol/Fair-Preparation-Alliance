- All gear, no skill: Relying on equipment you don’t know how to use. Tools like generators, water purifiers, firearms, etc. won’t help if you haven’t practiced with them. Training and hands-on practice are as important as the gear itself – otherwise the equipment can fail you when it matters.  
- No upkeep: Stockpiling and then ignoring your supplies. Food can expire, water can stagnate, batteries die. Don’t “set and forget.” Rotate your food stock (use and replace it periodically), refresh stored water and batteries on a schedule, and test your equipment to ensure everything still works.
