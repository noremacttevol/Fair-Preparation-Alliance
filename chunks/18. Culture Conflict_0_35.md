Step 3: Escalate to Circle-Level Review (if needed) – If mediation within the squad still fails to achieve resolution, or if the conflict is of a nature that the squad’s resources are insufficient (for example, it might involve allegations of serious misconduct, or it’s causing significant disruption to the squad’s work), the issue is escalated beyond the squad. At this stage, the matter goes to the Circle Council or a designated Circle Mediation Panel. The squad lead or Trust Liaison will inform the circle’s leadership that a conflict requires their attention. The circle might convene a small panel of peers from outside the immediate squad – possibly including one member of the Circle Council, another squad lead, and the Trust Liaison – to take a fresh look at the issue. This panel again does not hand down orders; rather, it provides a broader perspective and additional ideas for resolution. Sometimes bringing in people from outside the squad helps break a deadlock (they might suggest options neither party in the conflict considered). The panel meets with the individuals involved, either all together or separately as needed. After discussion, the panel will typically make a recommendation. This could be a suggested compromise, or in some cases, a finding that some corrective action is needed (like recommending one person take a cooling-off leave, or get specific training, or in extreme cases, be reassigned if they cannot work together).
