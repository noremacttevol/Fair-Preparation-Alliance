- **Global Perspective and Fallbacks:** A Phase 4 communicator always asks, “What if everything fails?” and then answers it. They design the ultimate fallback sequences for the Alliance. For example, they might create a plan that if all comms are lost, certain key members will travel to predetermined meeting points over the course of weeks to reconnect regions (basically a communication via movement strategy). They ensure that _knowledge_ itself is backed up in multiple formats (digital, paper, mnemonic). They might spearhead something like an “Alliance Almanac” – a printed or microfilm compendium of crucial info distributed to all chapters as a backup of the backups. This forward-thinking attitude at Phase 4 means even if lower phases haven’t thought about it, someone has a contingency.  
In summary, ORP Phase 4 is about **leadership and oversight** of the comms program. By then, one is shaping policy, not just following it, and looking to the horizon for threats and opportunities in keeping the Alliance connected.  
**Training Progression is Cumulative:** Each phase builds on the previous. A Phase 3 leader still needs all the skills of an operator if they have to jump on the radio themselves. Thus, training is **cumulative and ongoing**. We encourage all members, regardless of phase, to continually practice fundamental skills. Phase 1 and 2 drills (radio checks, etc.) remain useful even for Phase 4 folks to keep sharp and lead by example.
