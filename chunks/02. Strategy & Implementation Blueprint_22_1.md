- **Gear and System Refresh Cycles:** Part of redundancy is replacing things before they fail unexpectedly. The Operational Readiness plan sets refresh cycles for gear: e.g., replace batteries every X years, or rotate the role of who holds the emergency satellite phone to ensure multiple people know how to use it. Software and hardware are updated on a staggered schedule so that not everyone is changing at once (to avoid a single update bug crippling all units). These practices keep our “spares” fresh and our primary systems from aging into failure.  
To encapsulate our redundancy strategy, the following table provides examples of primary systems and their backup mechanisms across key domains:  
_(Table: Resilience Plan – Primary and Backup Systems for Critical Functions)_  
|**Function**|**Primary System/Method**|**Backup Mechanism**|
|---|---|---|
|**Communication**|FPA App messaging (internet or mesh)|Radio comms (HAM/GMRS), in-person relays, pre-set signals|
|**Navigation**|Digital maps in app (GPS-enabled)|Paper maps & compass; local geographic knowledge by members|
|**Information Access**|FPA App digital Guide & AI assistance|Printed guide excerpts; knowledge retention through training (members recall key info)|
|**Power Supply**|Electrical grid or vehicle power to charge devices|Solar chargers, battery banks, generator, hand-crank chargers|
