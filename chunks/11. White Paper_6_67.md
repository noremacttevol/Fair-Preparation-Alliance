- _Lessons Learned:_ **HAM radio is the fallback of all fallbacks** for communication. While not every member needs to be a HAM, having access to one (or a friendly local HAM club) is invaluable. And passing a message through multiple volunteer operators is an art – it requires brevity, clarity, and standard format (often written). **Lesson:** If your area has HAM operators, coordinate with them (some might not be formal squad members but will gladly assist). Also, train your squad to compose a proper emergency message so that it can be relayed accurately. Practicing a relay or participating in a regional HAM emergency net builds confidence that your squad will not be totally cut off.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- If you have a licensed HAM in the squad, great – engage them to set up a session teaching others how to format messages. If not, reach out to a local HAM radio club or an ARES group and explain you want to practice emergency messaging; most HAMs love to help and show off their gear.  
- Learn the standard message format (ARRL Radiogram format is one example) which includes fields like message number, precedence (emergency/priority), location, time, and the text. Even if you don’t use the exact format, structure your messages: Who, What, Where, When, Needs. For instance: “From FPA Squad Eastwood. After tornado, 5 injured, 20 homeless. Need water and tarps at Eastwood High School shelter. Over.”
