_Technical Structure:_ The AI logic is implemented as part of the application workflow (e.g., after form submission, a backend script or GPT service analyzes the input). A **“Yellow queue”** is available in the Admin Dashboard for staff to review flagged apps ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=ownership,%20skills,%20safety.%20,ham%20radio%20setup,%20drill%20signup/)). All decisions and data are recorded for transparency and to continually refine the AI’s accuracy. Anti-gaming measures are in place – e.g., the exact keywords looked for are kept internal, and true commitment is verified through later activity (no one gets to stay just by writing the right words if they don’t follow through in drills). By combining AI speed with human judgment, Phase2 can onboard many more members quickly **without lowering the bar** for quality.
