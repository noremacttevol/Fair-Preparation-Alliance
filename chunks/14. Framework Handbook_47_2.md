All these features are designed with an offline-first mindset. For instance, messages you send will queue and attempt every possible path (mesh, SMS if cell towers recover briefly, Wi-Fi when found, etc.) until delivered. Data sync happens opportunistically – if your phone meets another member’s phone via Bluetooth, they exchange any new info (this concept is called “sneakernet” or data ferrying). In short, the app tries hard to not let the lack of internet isolate you from your community.  
**Security:** Because we deal with sensitive information (locations, inventories), the app uses strong encryption for any data at rest and in transit. A Trust Doctrine principle is digital trust: members’ privacy is respected. Even if someone outside FPA intercepted our mesh messages, they’d get gibberish. The app requires member authentication, and if a device is lost, we have a remote wipe feature (which triggers once it connects to any other member device).
