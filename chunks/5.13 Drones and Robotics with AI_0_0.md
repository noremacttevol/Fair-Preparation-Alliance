In the realm of physical tasks, FPA is exploring how AI-driven drones and small robots could assist in emergency scenarios. Drones equipped with cameras, sensors, and even AI vision can be game-changers for reconnaissance. For instance, after a disaster like a hurricane, instead of sending people into uncertain areas, an FPA team can deploy a drone that autonomously navigates a preset grid, using AI to identify things like stranded individuals, flooded zones, or fires. The AI can flag these on the drone’s live feed, effectively highlighting “this house has a help signal on roof” or “this road is blocked by debris” without the operator having to catch every detail in real time. In wilderness searches for a missing person, thermal imaging drones with AI can scan large areas and pinpoint heat signatures that look human. On the ground, small robotic rovers could carry supplies to someone trapped or enter hazardous spots (like a partially collapsed building) to deliver water and a radio, guided by AI that avoids obstacles. These are emerging capabilities, so FPA treats them as experimental – they might have a tech subgroup that tests commercially available drone tech or even partakes in community robotics projects to tailor bots for their needs. A key aspect is making these systems resilient: ensuring drones can operate offline with manual overrides, and programming them to come back home if signal is lost. Also, charging and maintaining them is part of gear planning. In drills,
