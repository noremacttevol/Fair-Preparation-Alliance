Phase 2 (Gray-Sky Partial Outage): As communications infrastructure becomes unreliable – perhaps due to network overload or local outages – FPA members execute the next layer of the comm plan. Here, concise SMS texts become primary if voice calls are dropping (since texting can often work on weak networks). An example protocol: send a short check-in text to the group or to your chapter lead at the top of each hour with your status (“OK @ home” or “Evacuating now”) to conserve network usage. If internet is intermittent, members post updates on a pre-designated online board whenever they can connect. Out-of-area contacts might be used: if local comms are spotty, a member may reach a friend or relative outside the affected area, who in turn relays messages to others (a technique to get around localized blackouts). Meanwhile, FPA activates radio communications in parallel as a failsafe – local teams turn on FRS/GMRS radios on a chosen channel or ham operators prepare to relay info via repeaters if available. The Phase 2 plan is all about bridging the gap: using any working channel to ensure no one is in the dark. The communications become more structured – for instance, radio check-ins at scheduled times – to compensate for the reduced reliability. By the end of Phase 2, all members should know the situation status and the plan, even if conventional comms collapse further.
