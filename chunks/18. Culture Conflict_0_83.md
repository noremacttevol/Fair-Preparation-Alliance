Restorative Practices: We incorporate restorative justice approaches, where appropriate, especially for interpersonal harm. This means the person who caused harm and the person harmed (if willing) engage in a facilitated dialogue about what happened, its impact, and what the offender can do to repair the harm. Such reparations could be a sincere apology, community service within the Alliance, or specific commitments to change behavior. The focus is on understanding and healing, not just retribution. This can be powerful in preserving relationships and reintegrating people into the community after conflict. For example, if a member made a public outburst that embarrassed a team, a restorative action might be to take responsibility in the next meeting and commit to an agreed plan (maybe anger management coaching). Provided they follow through, trust can be gradually restored.
