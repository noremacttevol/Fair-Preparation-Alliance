Members are encouraged to develop specialized skills and take on roles that match their expertise for the benefit of the group. Common roles include medics, communications operators (radio specialists), security coordinators, logisticians (supply managers), and educators/trainers. By assigning roles, FPA ensures that critical functions (first aid, radio operation, etc.) are covered by qualified members. However, cross-training is also emphasized â€“ every specialist shares their knowledge so others can step in if needed. In practice, a member might primarily be a communications lead but also have basic medical and self-defense training learned from fellow specialists ([[3.17 Mentorship & Skill Exchange]]).
