Through collective experience, the Alliance has developed an “FPA Approved Gear List” – a list of vetted items that have proven reliable and cost-effective. This list helps members (especially newcomers) avoid trial-and-error with critical gear. It covers categories like:  
- Water Filters: e.g., “Sawyer Squeeze” and “Berkey” for home use are on the list after testing flow rate and longevity.  
- Radios: recommended models of HAM/GMRS handhelds that most use, for easy programming and part swaps (like Baofeng UV-5R or Wouxun models, including programming cable info).  
- Generators: specific inverter generator models that are quiet and fuel-efficient which the group has used successfully.  
- First Aid Kits: either a commercial kit brand that FPA supplements or a detailed list to DIY assemble one, which meets certain standards (like Adventure Medical Kits with added tourniquets).  
- Multitools/Knives: Brands like Leatherman (e.g., Wave model) and Morakniv companion knives made the list due to durability and value.  
- Solar Panels: a certain folding panel and charge controller combo that members found user-friendly and robust.  
- Backpacks and Totes: tested packs for BOBs that withstand heavy use, and waterproof totes for cache storage that sealed best.  
- Protective Gear: e.g., a specific work glove that lasted longest, a headlamp brand with good runtime, etc.
