There may also be a voting element: perhaps each chapter leader gets a vote on major changes, ensuring democratic input. They want to avoid any authoritarian vibe in strategy – part of maintaining trust is that members feel heard in decisions that affect the alliance’s path. At the same time, to avoid paralysis, they entrust certain seasoned leaders with emergency decision power if needed (like a strategic pivot during an unfolding crisis). But generally, slow, deliberate consensus-building is the norm for growth direction. Transparency is key; after making a strategic decision, they likely publish a summary to all members (“after considering X and Y, we have decided to do Z”). This approach keeps strategy aligned with the group’s values and the real conditions on the ground, and helps ensure members at all levels are on the same page about where FPA is headed.
