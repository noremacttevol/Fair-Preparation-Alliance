- **EMP and Data Protection:** FPA’s systems consider worst-case scenarios like electromagnetic pulses (EMP) that could knock out electronics. That’s why there’s emphasis on things like Faraday-caging vital electronics and having non-electronic backups. For example, the FPA **HAM radio policy** suggests storing your radio in a shielded container when not in use ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=ham%20info%20overview%20access%20pulse,shielded%20in%20a%20faraday%20cage/)). Similarly, FPAi’s knowledge can’t be zapped from your brain – members are encouraged to memorize critical protocols and keep printed cheat sheets. While FPAi itself won’t run without power, the knowledge it helped you curate will still be with you. Additionally, all FPA data is routinely backed up offline in secure storage by the organization (and key protocol documents are distributed to local leaders in print) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=match%20at%20l1313%20,%20so%20an%20attacker%20cant-wk10dhq/)). So even if an attack or outage hits our servers, we can restore from backups quickly, or fall back to paper until systems are back. **Bottom line:** FPAi is woven into a broader resilience plan. It’s incredibly powerful during connected times, and it leaves behind tangible, low-tech assets for when the lights go out. You can trust that the fancy AI stuff won’t leave you high and dry; FPAi’s guidance lives on in
