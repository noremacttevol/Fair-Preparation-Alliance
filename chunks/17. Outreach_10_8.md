with caution until verified. In essence, we distribute the **sense-making** process across the network. Compare this to most emergency communication systems that either blast unverified social media posts (risky) or only allow official sources (which can be slow and limited). We’ve found a middle way, harnessing community eyes and ears but tempering them with validation steps. This system is unique in emergency prep in that it formalizes what often happens informally in disasters (neighbors checking with neighbors). We’ve turned it into part of our SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures). The result is higher signal-to-noise ratio in our comms.
