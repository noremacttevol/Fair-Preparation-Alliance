- **Compass Guide Orientation:** The [[Compass Guide]] (FPA’s ethos handbook) is introduced during onboarding to every member. In Phase1 this is via a PDF or link; by Phase2 it could be an interactive mini-course or at least a required reading acknowledgement. The Compass Guide covers principles like **community cooperation over lone-wolf prepping, fairness in resource sharing, neutrality** in political/religious issues, etc. ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=the%20,strategic%20compass%20for%20the%20community/)) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=of%20fairness%20in%20resource%20distribution,,in%20line%20with%20its%20principles/)). Ensuring each user grasps these principles is crucial. The app can incorporate _checkpoint questions_ (e.g., “According to the Compass Guide, why do we emphasize helping neighbors?”) to reinforce understanding. By Phase3, referencing the Compass Guide becomes second nature in decision-making. For example, if a squad debate arises about whether to admit a controversial member, leadership might recall Compass Guide directives. Keeping these principles in the **lexicon of the user journey** (through quotes, tooltips, or scenario-based learning) helps maintain a **strong, shared culture** even as the user base scales.
