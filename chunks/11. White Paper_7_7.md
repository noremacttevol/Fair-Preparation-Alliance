- **Volunteer Management Integration:** FEMA guidance on spontaneous volunteers suggests having a structure to integrate them ([Working with the Cajun Navy: Optimizing the use of volunteers in disaster response | NSF - National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/news/working-cajun-navy-optimizing-use-volunteers#:~:text=Communication%20between%20volunteers%20and%20formal,coordinated%20to%20help%20dispatch%20volunteers)). Your squad can be ahead of the game by being an **organized cluster of volunteers** rather than individuals. Emphasize this when talking to emergency services: “Instead of 20 separate volunteers, you get one cohesive unit.” Some progressive emergency managers will then task your squad as a whole, effectively making your squad lead a “Unit Leader” in ICS managing those 20 people. This is ideal integration. To facilitate it, provide the officials a roster of your squad (names, skills) when you check in. Also carry any ID or CERT credentials members have. The Volunteer Coordination Team at the EOC (if activated) might have you officially sign in for liability coverage ([Working with the Cajun Navy: Optimizing the use of volunteers in disaster response | NSF - National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/news/working-cajun-navy-optimizing-use-volunteers#:~:text=volunteers%20often%20entered%20dangerous%20areas,coordinated%20to%20help%20dispatch%20volunteers)) – ensure everyone does so, or the Liaison signs in on behalf of the group, as required.
