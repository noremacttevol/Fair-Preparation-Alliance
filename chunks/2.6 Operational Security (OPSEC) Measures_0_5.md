they might be on the move (“heading to family”), to deflect inquiries. The alliance has contingency plans if they suspect they’ve been compromised (like relocating a meeting site, or in worst case scattering and regrouping later). The balance FPA strikes is between secrecy and effectiveness: members need enough info to act, but not so much that a single breach endangers everyone. These OPSEC measures are drilled into members from day one – it’s part of the culture of trust that you protect each other’s privacy and security. By rigorously following OPSEC, FPA increases its survivability; enemies cannot easily target what they cannot pin down. (Cross-ref: [[Member Privacy and Data Security]] focuses on individual data protection, which overlaps OPSEC. Also [[Ham Radio Network]] and [[Communication Security (COMSEC)]] notes detail specific comm security tactics.)
