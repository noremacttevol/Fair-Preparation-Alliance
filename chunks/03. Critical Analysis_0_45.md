Corporate and Economic Pressures: The corporate world could react in multiple ways. The burgeoning “disaster preparedness industry” (selling everything from freeze-dried food to bunkers) might see FPA as a huge new market – which is both a danger and opportunity. If corporate sponsors flood FPA with money, they might expect influence (e.g. pushing FPA to recommend their products, undermining the “fair” aspect). Co-optation by commercial interests could turn FPA into a marketing platform, damaging its credibility and trust among members. On the flip side, certain industries might dislike a movement that encourages self-reliance (for example, if FPA promotes local food growing and tool sharing, it might very slightly dent consumer spending on groceries or goods). This is likely a minor issue, but in theory large corporations benefit from dependent consumers, not self-sufficient communities.
