- **Proto-AI and Analytics:** While full AI integration comes in Phase3, in Phase2 we can start building simple analytics rules. For instance, we might implement a basic algorithm for a preliminary survivability score: e.g., “If First Aid >70% AND Navigation >70% AND all others >50%, then mark survivability as ~75%.” These kinds of rules (more complex than that example, but along those lines) can be tested internally. We might also run the AI in a “shadow mode” during this phase: FPAi generates recommendations or scores based on the data, but we don’t show them to members yet – instead, we give them to a few staff or beta testers to evaluate whether the AI’s advice is good. This way, when we officially launch AI features in Phase3, we’ve already verified their quality.  
- **Offline Preparedness:** We’ll begin implementing some of the offline features in Phase2. For example, by the end of Phase2 it’s reasonable to aim for every member’s physical SHTF binder to include a printout of their current Skill Wheel and a basic personal skill page. We might coordinate a one-time mailing or meeting where we distribute these printouts to all members, to test how they use them. This also gives us a chance to test our offline update process – for instance, during a nationwide drill or event, we can observe whether members reference their printed skill cards and if they find them useful in practice.
