- **Financial Oversight & Live Audit Feed:** One of Governance & Oversight’s key tasks is managing finances **transparently**. They run the **live audit feed** that was mentioned earlier. Every financial transaction the Alliance makes is logged (likely via accounting software with a public dashboard). Governance folks monitor this feed for accuracy and propriety. They perform audits – both routine and surprise – to ensure no funds are misused. They produce quarterly financial summaries that any member can review, translating the raw feed into understandable reports (“Last quarter, we spent $20k on gear subsidies, $5k on training events, saved $10k for emergency fund, etc.”). They handle tax matters and legal filings if any (like maintaining our non-profit status or equivalent). If someone suspects embezzlement or waste, this team investigates. The “live” aspect means members usually catch things even before official audits – and Governance encourages that, effectively crowdsourcing honesty. They are keenly aware that trust is our currency, and money issues can destroy trust fast. So they act with _complete transparency_ and invite scrutiny.
