Many of the most visible changes from Mk1Mod2 to Mk1Mod3 are operational – the day-to-day methods and tools we use.  
**Squad-Based Organization:** Operationally, FPA now runs on a **squad structure** (Chapter 4). In Mk1Mod2, local groups existed but were loosely organized. Mk1Mod3 formalizes squads as units of about 5–12 people with defined roles (leader, medic, communications lead, etc.). This clear structure improves efficiency and ensures critical tasks are covered. It draws inspiration from proven models like community emergency response teams and even the Incident Command System, wherein having defined roles and common terminology allows diverse groups to “meld” into a common structure quickly. By adopting a small-unit approach, we can operate effectively even if larger coordination breaks down; each squad is a self-sufficient team that can also plug into bigger operations if needed.
