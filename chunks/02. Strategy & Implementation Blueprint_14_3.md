This architecture has been rolled out in phases to members, with early testing in low-stakes environments to iron out issues. The rollout plan ensures that by the time we rely on the app in a critical situation, it has been **battle-tested** via drills and perhaps small real incidents. Each update to the app (patch) is first approved by a tech committee aligned with the Trust Doctrine â€“ meaning no code that compromises privacy or resilience is allowed. Members are notified of app updates and patches (with release notes in understandable language, not just technical jargon, to maintain transparency).
