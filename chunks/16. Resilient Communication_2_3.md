use solid metal or double-layered foil as needed. For larger installations, entire rooms or closets can be converted into shielded vaults by lining walls with metal foil or mesh and grounding it properly at a single point. The goal is simple: any spare radio, backup laptop/tablet, hard drive, or solar charging unit that you might depend on post-disaster **must** survive the pulse. That means stashing it in a Faraday container or a similarly shielded state **ahead of time**.
