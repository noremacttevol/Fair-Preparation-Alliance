At the foundation are our people organized into **squads**. A squad is a small, tight-knit team of FPA members (typically 5-10 individuals) who operate together as the primary unit of action. Each squad is designed to be **semi-autonomous and self-sufficient**:  
- **Composition & Roles:** Squads have a balanced mix of skills. Members may take on roles like coordinator (squad lead), medic, navigator, communications, safety officer, etc., depending on context. These roles are defined in the _Compass Guide_ and ensure that within each squad, essential responsibilities are covered.  
- **Unit Cohesion:** Squad members train together regularly. They build trust through shared experience in drills and small missions. This cohesion means that in an emergency or complex task, they can rely on each other instinctively.  
- **Autonomy and Networking:** While squads can act independently when needed (e.g. if cut off from others), they are also nodes in a larger network. Squads coordinate with other squads for larger operations or mutual aid, using the FPA App and SOPs to stay in sync. This network-of-squads model means we have **scalable operations** â€“ small teams handling local issues, scaling up to the whole organization for big challenges.
