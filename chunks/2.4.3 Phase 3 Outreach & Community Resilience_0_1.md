can benefit their neighbors. For instance, an FPA medical specialist might help establish a community clinic; members with engineering or trade skills may assist in repairing critical infrastructure (wells, power generation via solar, etc.). Community resilience projects could be initiated: setting up community gardens with saved heirloom seeds from members’ stocks, organizing neighborhood security patrols that include non-FPA residents (always guided by FPA’s fairness and anti-discrimination values), and establishing barter markets (with principles from [[Barter and Trade Strategies]]) for equitable exchange of goods. During Phase 3, FPA transitions from semi-secret network to an integral community pillar.
