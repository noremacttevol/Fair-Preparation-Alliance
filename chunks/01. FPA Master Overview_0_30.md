Continuous Improvement & Feedback Loops: Finally, Core Coordination institutionalizes learning. They collect after-action reports from every exercise or incident and look for lessons. They track performance metrics (participation rates, response times, audit scores) and identify trends. If a plan or policy isn’t yielding results, Core changes it. This feedback loop means FPA’s strategy and structure are always evolving for the better. (For example, if readiness audits show many members are weak in a certain skill, Core might task the Readiness team to emphasize that in training, or update the SOPs to address it.) In collaboration with Governance & Oversight, they ensure member feedback and on-the-ground realities directly inform strategic updates. Nothing stays on paper if it doesn’t work in practice.  
Tech & App Dev (Content Family2)  
The Tech & App Dev content family is FPA’s innovation engine – the builders and maintainers of the tools that give us our modern edge. Their mandate is to develop technology that amplifies our capabilities, keeps us connected, and safeguards our operations. Crucially, all tech is developed with our core worst-case scenario in mind: we must be able to use it in austere conditions, without internet or even grid power. Tech & App Dev works hand-in-hand with Core Coordination’s strategic needs, focusing on engineering resilient digital solutions. Here’s a deep dive into what this family handles:
