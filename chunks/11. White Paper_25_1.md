**Lessons Learned:** One lesson was to keep the council size manageable but representative – we started with about 15 members (which worked). Too few would ignore voices, too many would be unwieldy. We learned to rotate agenda and leadership to avoid any one faction dominating: e.g., different regions take turns chairing monthly calls. Initially, some local squads feared this was a drift to centralization, but by publishing council meeting notes and inviting feedback on decisions, trust was maintained. Another lesson: we needed a mechanism to resolve ties or disagreements – we adopted a simple voting system (one region, one vote on major issues) and a commitment to consensus where possible, which has held so far. The council also learned its limits – it doesn’t micromanage local squads; if it tried, people would ignore it. Instead, it focuses on big picture and leaves execution to those on the ground.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Determine the composition of the National Council: likely one representative from each region (10), plus a few at-large positions for key domains (communications, training, logistics, etc.) for expertise. Ensure every member is an active FPA volunteer with trust of their peers.  
- Set selection method: allow regions to choose their rep by vote or consensus among squad leaders. For at-large seats, perhaps the existing interim leaders (from Phase 2’s core team) fill them initially, with plan for formal selection later.
