- **APIs and Integration:** The app and servers communicate through well-defined APIs. All API endpoints are designed to tolerate delays and outages (using store-and-forward techniques). For example, if a user submits a log entry or vote, the app will keep it locally until it can reach a server or a peer that can forward it. The system is event-driven â€“ changes are propagated when possible, rather than constantly depending on a live connection.  
- **Security Layer:** Throughout the stack, security protocols (authentication, encryption) are in place. Members authenticate with strong credentials (and offline, the app can use cached credentials and device security to allow access). Any data leaving a device is signed and encrypted, preventing forgery or eavesdropping. When edge or central servers receive data, they verify signatures and then update logs or data stores accordingly.
