- _Lessons Learned:_ You need a redundant, layered **alert system** to mobilize the squad (and possibly the wider neighborhood). Electronic methods (group texts, apps) are convenient but may fail in disaster conditions. Old-school methods (phone trees, sirens, physical runners) shouldn’t be discounted. **Lesson:** Have at least two ways to reach each member. Also, practice it – an untested alert plan is just theory.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Compile a contact list of all squad members with multiple contact methods (cell, landline if any, email, social handle). Secure this list but ensure every member has a copy in some form (laminated card, or saved offline on their phone).  
- Establish a primary alert method for different scenarios: e.g., **Tier 1** – a WhatsApp/Signal group or SMS blast for when internet/cell is up; **Tier 2** – a phone tree (designate who calls whom) for when urgent voice contact is needed; **Tier 3** – physical methods for when phones are down (this could be designated people biking to certain blocks to shout or using whistles).  
- If available, integrate any local warning system: encourage members to sign up for official text alerts (e.g., FEMA Wireless Emergency Alerts, local reverse-911). The squad can act on those quickly as a trigger.
