- **Continuous Adaptation:** New problems arise, like a rumor of looters targeting an abandoned store. FPA’s Security Leads coordinate with local neighborhood watch and actually make contact with the police to prevent vigilantism – they set up a schedule to keep watch and report anything, effectively stopping false rumors. Another issue: some members are exhausted after 48 hours of work; ORP planning kicks in and fresher members rotate in, ensuring people rest. The Trust Doctrine ensures no one is doing this alone or unnoticed – if a Squad Leader is overwhelmed, a Chapter Coordinator steps in to support.
