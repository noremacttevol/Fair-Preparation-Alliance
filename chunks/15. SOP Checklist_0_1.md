...# Personal SOP Checklist  
**Your FPA Personal SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) Checklist** is a step-by-step guide to becoming a reliable and active member of the Fair Preparation Alliance. This isn’t abstract advice – it’s a blunt list of what you need to _do_. By following this checklist, you ensure you meet FPA’s Phase 1 expectations for individual readiness and set yourself up for greater responsibilities in Phase 2 and 3. Think of it as your prepper “to-do list” with the Alliance: it covers training, gear, personal readiness, and squad participation. Complete these items, and you won’t just call yourself an FPA member – you’ll **prove** it. _(If any terms or tools are unfamiliar, refer to the **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]**. If you want to understand the philosophy behind these tasks, see the **[[Compass Guide]]**.)_
