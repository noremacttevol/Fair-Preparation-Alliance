- **Ethical Endorsements – No Hidden Commissions:** FPA does not accept hidden commissions or kickbacks on endorsed products. If the Alliance ever earns any referral fee or affiliate reward from a purchase link (for example, if we share a link to a trusted retailer who gives a small percentage back to our nonprofit operations), it will be explicitly stated to members. Currently, our default practice is to negotiate **up-front discounts for members** instead of any back-end commissions. That means when you see an endorsed item, you might also see a code or link for, say, “FPA Member Price: 15% off retail.” That benefit goes directly to you, rather than the Alliance taking a cut in secret. If, in some cases, we do arrange a small commission to fund Alliance activities (for instance, to cover web hosting of the gear list), this will be out in the open and agreed upon by the membership council – and it will never influence which products we endorse or how we evaluate them. The evaluation happens first, independently; any deals are made **after** and are purely to benefit the community or mission.
