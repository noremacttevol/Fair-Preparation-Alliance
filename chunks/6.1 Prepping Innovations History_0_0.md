Understanding where we came from helps FPA innovate for the future. Historically, emergency preparedness has evolved from simple civil defense measures (like backyard bomb shelters and canned food stockpiles in the mid-20th century) to today’s high-tech gadgetry and community-driven approaches. In the past, innovations were often driven by governments – e.g., the US Civil Defense program introduced air-raid sirens and neighborhood wardens, and later, FEMA developed the CERT (Community Emergency Response Team) concept to train civilians. Grassroots preppers innovated too: in the 1970s-80s, survivalists popularized homesteading skills and alternative energy like DIY solar panels or wind turbines to live off-grid. We saw the rise of survival literature: books and newsletters sharing new ideas (like square-foot gardening for efficient food production, or the first “bug-out bag” checklists). As technology advanced, the late 90s and early 2000s brought in personal GPS devices, affordable HAM radios, and online forums which allowed rapid exchange of prepping ideas globally. The term “prepper” itself became mainstream around then, shifting away from lone survivalist towards community networks sharing tips. More recently, open-source movements and maker culture contributed to prepping – think of innovators creating cheap water purification systems, or 3D-printable parts for hand pumps and tools. FPA catalogs these past innovations to both pay homage and pick up the baton: whether it’s
