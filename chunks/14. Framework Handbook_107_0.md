The FPA App and AI were developed with input from our tech-savvy volunteers and are continuously refined. We value **transparency**: members are educated about how data is used (no data leaves the network unless they choose to share it) and how the AI operates within set ethical guidelines.  
The system is modular so we can improve components over time (e.g., swap in a better offline map tool, or update the AI model as technology advances). Importantly, we keep the **user experience simple** – in a crisis, tools must be intuitive. One tap to report an incident, clear big buttons for emergency modes, etc.  
**Accessibility:** The app runs on common Android devices (iOS support is being tested). It’s optimized for low-power phones so that older or inexpensive devices can still use it. We even have a basic text interface via SMS/mesh for those who prefer non-smartphone use, ensuring no one is left out due to tech preference or limitations.  
In Mk1Mod2, much of our coordination relied on external apps and platforms. Mk1Mod3’s integrated app and AI bring everything under one resilient umbrella tailored to our mission. It exemplifies our realist approach: we use advanced tools _practically_ and _ethically_ to empower communities, without making us dependent on any single technology.
