How does the Trust Doctrine manifest day-to-day? Here are a few examples:  
- A hurricane is approaching and a new member posts an alert on the FPA app. Others see it and trust that it’s genuine (because misinformation is taboo in our culture). They act on it, securing their homes earlier than they might have otherwise. Meanwhile, leadership trusts the on-the-ground reports enough to mobilize resources even before official news confirms the event.  
- During a heatwave, one squad’s water supplies ran low. They reached out to a nearby squad for help. Thanks to established trust, the second squad immediately shared a portion of their water, trusting that if the roles were reversed, the favor would be returned. There was no bargaining or hesitation – the doctrine of mutual support was ingrained.  
- A member had financial trouble and couldn’t afford a new generator when hers failed. Instead of quietly hoping for the best, she was honest about it with her squad. Because of the culture FPA has set, she felt safe admitting this vulnerability. The squad pooled funds to get a generator using the alliance’s dynamic pricing credits, treating it as an investment in the whole team’s resilience. Trust made it possible for her to speak up and for others to help without judgment.
