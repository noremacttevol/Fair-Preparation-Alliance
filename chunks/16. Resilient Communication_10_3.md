**Continuous Improvement:** This doctrine is meant to be a living document. After major drills or real events, we will revise it. Every lesson learned is incorporated so mistakes are not repeated. Section 16 will be updated with vignettes of what actually happened in crises and how we overcame challenges (or failed to, and how to fix it). Members are encouraged to provide feedback – if something in the doctrine didn’t work in the field, report it up so it can be addressed. This loop ensures that our communications readiness remains cutting-edge and battle-tested. It also keeps members engaged in thinking critically about our procedures, not just rote following. Remember, _flexibility within a framework_ – the doctrine gives a strong framework, but we empower smart adaptation when needed and then fold those adaptations back into the framework for all.  
**Mission-First, People-First:** Ultimately, communications readiness is not for its own sake; it’s for the mission – which is the preservation and prosperity of our people in the worst of times. Every antenna raised, every battery charged, every code word memorized, is in service of saving lives and rebuilding hope. When the world goes silent, we will be the ones to find each other in the darkness and organize. When others are isolated and afraid, we can extend our network to bring them in. This is _coordinated survival_. It’s how a prepared community beats the odds that would crush any lone actor.
