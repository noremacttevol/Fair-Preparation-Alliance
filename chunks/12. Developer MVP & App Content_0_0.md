INSTRUCTION FOR GPT REWRITE Â· FPA Mk1Mod3 Â· 12. Developer MVP & App Content.md  
This note is part of a coordinated 21-file rewrite. The system has accumulated inconsistencies in terminology, outdated references, and fragmented logic. Your task is to:  
âœ… Standardize terminology across the Mk1Mod3 system.
âœ… Flag and fix misalignments between sections and related files.
âœ… Deeply interlink this note with all other Mk1Mod3 documents using [[Note Name]] format.
âœ… Maintain original meaning â€” but clarify, consolidate, and format for coherence.
âœ… DO NOT create new ideas or models â€” restructure only based on what exists.  
Known systemic issues to watch for:
- Terms, role names, or procedures that differ between files and need unification.
- Notes that refer to concepts covered elsewhere without linking or quoting.
- Updates to frameworks or protocols that aren't reflected consistently.
- Lack of clear flow between orientation â†’ training â†’ execution â†’ governance â†’ feedback.  
Your rewrite goal:
Define features, flows, and GPT touchpoints. Interlink all modules with corresponding logic and readiness states.  
Audience:
developers, content architects
