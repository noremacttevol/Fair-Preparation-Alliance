FPA encourages members to study the SHTF Bible _before_ the SHTF. Many squads have a “topic of the month” they study together from the Bible (e.g., in January they might all review the Winter Storm section, in summer the Heatwave section). This not only prepares them mentally, but also helps catch any errors or unclear parts, which they can report.  
Yes, members can suggest edits. There’s a feedback loop: if someone finds a better way to do something, or if a section wasn’t clear in practice, they can submit suggestions through the app or at meetings. The content team reviews it and, if validated, updates the master document. In this way, the knowledge base grows and adapts. The Trust Doctrine ensures contributions are shared freely – FPA is about pooling knowledge for everyone’s gain, not hoarding secrets.  
**Legacy Note:** In Mk1Mod2, various guides existed (we had a “Prepper Library” online), but it wasn’t unified. The SHTF Bible in Mk1Mod3 consolidates all those separate PDFs and tipsheets into one canonical collection with the latest info. If you come across older references to the “FPA handbook” or “manuals”, know that those have all been rolled into the SHTF Bible now.
