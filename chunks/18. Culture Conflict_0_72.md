Knowledge Management: FPA will maintain a repository (with respect for confidentiality) of conflict cases and resolutions (anonymized as needed), and reflection outputs. From this, we can derive patterns and trends. For instance, if multiple conflicts cite “unclear decision rights” as a factor, that pattern is flagged and taken to the Governance team to clarify roles Alliance-wide. If our repository shows that mediation at step 2 often succeeds when a certain technique is used (like caucusing separately first), we incorporate that into mediator training. Essentially, we treat conflict management as a discipline to be continuously improved – similar to how companies use incident databases to improve safety. Perhaps we produce an annual “State of Internal Peace” report that summarizes the number and type of conflicts, how they were resolved, and any policy changes that resulted (again, likely anonymized). This transparency, if eventually made public, could even serve as a model for other organizations.
