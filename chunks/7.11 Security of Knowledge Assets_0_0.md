FPA treats its knowledge assets with the same caution as physical supplies, ensuring they are protected from loss, theft, or tampering. Digitally, sensitive parts of the Knowledge Vault (like member contact info, cache locations, or operational plans) are encrypted so that if a drive falls into the wrong hands, data remains safe. Password managers are used for any credentials, with master passwords known only to trusted council members (and backup written copies in secure places). The alliance might even have an “emergency data wipe” procedure – for instance, if an area is overrun by hostile actors, a member can trigger a quick format of a drive containing sensitive info, relying on the redundant backups elsewhere to restore later. In terms of cyber security, they keep systems offline as much as possible; the vault might live on devices not regularly connected to the Internet to reduce hack risk. When devices do connect (for updates or sync), they use VPNs or secure networks. Physical documents are locked in safes or lockboxes when stored at chapter locations. The membership is briefed on OPSEC (operational security) regarding information: e.g., don’t leave printouts of plans lying around publicly, and don’t discuss sensitive details over unsecured channels. Code words might be used in comms to obscure meaning (as mentioned in [[4.15 Communication Security & Encryption]]). Additionally, they consider the longevity and safety of knowledge storage – USB drives and hard drives
