- **Printed Outputs and Guides:** All of FPA’s AI insights are **exportable to print**. The system makes it easy to download or print your plan reports, checklists, and guides ahead of time. FPA encourages members to keep hard copies of crucial info. In fact, FPA’s preparedness philosophy always includes a paper layer: the _SHTF Bible_ itself is a physical binder you can reference when devices fail. FPAi complements this by ensuring anything it helps you with (like your refined emergency plan or a squad roster with roles) can be turned into a printable format without hassle. Prior to a looming disaster (say a hurricane forecast), you might use FPAi to double-check and then print your plan report and some “just-in-time” checklists. **If Day Zero (the crisis) arrives and the power’s out**, you’ll have those FPAi-generated printouts ready. In FPA’s _Day Zero protocol_, there are three pillars for when everything fails: **HAM radio for communication, printed manuals for plans, and pre-set squad rally points** ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=the%20fpa%20ensures%20squads%20are,manuals%20for%20plans,%20and%20squad/)). FPAi’s role here is pre-crisis – it helps you get your plan in top shape and then **outputs it to a durable format**. For example, if FPAi identified gaps in your plan, those insights can be inserted into your printed manual so that even without any tech, you have the AI’s guidance in hand
