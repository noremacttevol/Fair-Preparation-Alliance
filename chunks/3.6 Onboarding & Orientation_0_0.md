Upon joining, new members undergo a structured orientation to become effective parts of the Alliance. This onboarding process includes introductions to key contacts and mentors, a briefing on current plans and resources, and an overview of communication channels ([[4.1 Communications Strategy Overview]]). New members receive or create a profile of their skills and needs, helping the group integrate them appropriately. They are guided through initial preparations â€“ for example, assembling personal emergency kits (with the help of the FPA [[7.41 FPA Approved Gear List]]), and setting up any required tools (such as joining the radio network or digital platforms). Early orientation ensures that even newcomers are quickly ready to contribute during an emergency rather than being a liability.
