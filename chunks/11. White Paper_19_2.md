- Choose a format and platform for the registry. Ideally, maintain a master digital database that can be easily updated, but also produce a static export (PDF or print directory) for offline use. A simple spreadsheet or table that can be printed as a booklet might suffice.  
- Populate the registry: task each Squad Leader from Phase 2 to submit their squad’s details. Provide a template form (both online via a secure form and offline via mail-in or phone for those without internet). Emphasize the importance of accuracy and that this isn’t for public distribution – it’s an internal FPA tool under the Trust Doctrine’s privacy guidelines.  
- Implement verification: regional coordinators (or newly formed regional councils) verify the existence and info of squads in their territory. This can be as simple as a quick call or cross-check with known members, ensuring no fake entries or outdated squads remain listed.  
- Once data is collected, publish the first edition of the registry. Distribute it to FPA leadership and relay squads. Also, consider giving each squad a list of other squads in their state/region so they know their neighbors.  
- Establish an update mechanism: require squads to confirm their info every 3 or 6 months. This could be done during a scheduled net meeting or an email reminder. No response after a period could flag a squad as inactive until reconfirmed.
