- Partner with a tech volunteer group or university to develop or adapt AI software for FPA needs. Perhaps adapt existing disaster management tools. Ensure data inputs (like squad inventories, requests, etc.) are fed in from our registry and comm logs.  
- Pilot the AI on historical data: run it against past situations (e.g., last year’s hurricane response logs) to see what it would have suggested and tune its parameters based on whether those ideas are actually sensible or not.  
- Set up an **AI Oversight Board** (maybe the one mentioned in governance planning) – a few FPA members with tech savvy and ethics insight – to monitor the AI’s recommendations and effects. They will ensure it’s not drifting into bias or misinterpreting our values (for instance, if the AI starts favoring efficiency over equitable help, that’s a red flag to correct).  
- Incorporate AI outputs into decision-making routines: for example, before a council meeting, review the AI’s resource distribution suggestions as one input to plans; have moderators glance at AI-flagged posts in the forum each day as part of their workflow.  
- Train members in how to work with the AI: e.g., regional leads learn to query the dashboard (“show me all unmet requests in my region”) or ask for possible solutions (“how can we get more medical kits?”). Provide cheat sheets or a help function (and yes, print a guide for those who might use it via text interface only).
