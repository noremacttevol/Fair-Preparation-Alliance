Preparedness is not a one-time checklist; it’s a continuous journey. Recognizing this, FPA’s Mk1Mod3 introduces an **Operational Readiness Progression (ORP)** program – a structured path for members to develop their skills and preparedness over time. This progression provides milestones and goals, helping members gauge their growth from novices to seasoned responders. It’s both an individual and collective measure: as each member advances, the whole alliance becomes stronger.
