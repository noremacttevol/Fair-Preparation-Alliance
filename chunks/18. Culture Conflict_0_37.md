Step 4: Resolution, Documentation, and Follow-Up – Once a conflict is resolved (at whatever step – it might have been resolved at step 1 itself, or required step 3), it’s important to document the outcome and follow up over time.

Next check-in on this will be [date].” This record is useful in case the issue resurfaces or if there are patterns of repeated conflicts. It will be kept confidential, accessible only to relevant parties and the necessary oversight persons (e.g., Trust Liaison or HR if applicable). Follow-up means that after some weeks or months, the mediator or squad lead should touch base with the parties: “How are things going? Is the agreement holding up? Any new concerns?” This reinforces that FPA cares about lasting resolution, not just quick fixes. If the conflict was serious, maybe a formal review at 3 and 6 months is scheduled. If the conflict led to any broader changes (like new team guidelines), those should be evaluated later to ensure they had the intended effect. We also encourage the individuals to reflect on what was learned. The squad might do a retrospective where, without rehashing personal details, they discuss what the team learned about teamwork from that conflict (e.g. “We learned we need clearer roles, so we’ve implemented that.”). Positive reinforcement is given when people
