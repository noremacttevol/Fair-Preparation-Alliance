**A Founding Fathers/Mothers Moment:** We often draw inspiration from the founding of free nations or pivotal movements. There is a similar romance and gravity to what we’re doing. It’s as if we’re gathering in our equivalent of Philadelphia’s hall, hashing out how to empower the people to handle crises themselves. Each of you brings unique perspectives (some are medics, some radio techies, some community organizers, etc.), and just like those historical figures, we debate, we refine, and ultimately we agree on a blueprint. Take pride in that role. Not everyone gets to say they helped write the playbook that might save civilization (or at least communities) in its hour of need.
