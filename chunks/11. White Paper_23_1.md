**Lessons Learned:** Joining VOAD taught us the value of visibility and standards. We had to clearly explain our mission and abide by certain guidelines (like not self-deploying into disaster zones without checking in, to avoid duplicating efforts) – a reasonable trade-off to be at the table. We learned that through VOAD, we could influence broader strategy: for instance, FPA lobbied successfully within VOAD for better use of HAM radio when phone networks collapse, something that wasn’t on their radar before. Another lesson from joint exercises was that FPA needed to practice the Incident Command System (ICS) structure to slot into multi-agency operations smoothly. Some squads initially chafed at “command and control” style, but drills underscored that we can follow an incident commander in the moment and still stay true to our independence outside those operations.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Complete the application for National VOAD membership (or relevant regional VOAD chapters where applicable). Highlight FPA’s unique contributions: community reach, communications, flexibility. Provide references from any friendly agencies or NGOs to bolster the application.  
- Once a member, assign a representative to attend VOAD meetings regularly (national conference calls, regional coordination meetings, etc.). They will report back to FPA leadership so we stay aligned with larger efforts.
