Fairness and Impartiality: Our processes strive to be fair and unbiased. Conflicts are handled based on evidence and principles, not politics or personal favors. Whenever mediation or adjudication is needed, neutral parties (peers trusted by all sides or designated mediators) will facilitate. Everyone involved in a conflict – including leadership – will have a chance to be heard. Decisions and resolutions will be reasoned and aligned with FPA’s values (guided by the moral “compass” of our Compass Guide). Conflicts of interest are carefully managed; for example, a person will recuse themselves from mediating or deciding a dispute if they have a close personal stake in its outcome.  
Constructive Conflict & Growth: FPA views constructive conflict as essential for innovation and avoiding complacency. We distinguish productive disagreement from destructive fighting. Members are encouraged to voice dissenting opinions and debate ideas vigorously, in pursuit of the best solutions for the Alliance. By embracing differences in perspective rather than silencing them, we guard against groupthink and continually improve. Even when conflict is interpersonal, we seek outcomes that heal relationships and yield lessons. Every conflict is an opportunity to reaffirm our principles or to refine them. Through structured reflection, we convert conflicts into organizational learning (just as resolved conflicts can reveal underlying issues in processes and policies, prompting positive change).
