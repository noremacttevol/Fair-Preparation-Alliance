used items. Simplicity is valued: a manual can opener may be preferred over an electric one, fewer moving parts equals less chance to break. They also incorporate gear sustainability: items that are rechargeable via solar, or that can use renewable resources (like a wood gas stove vs. canned fuel only) are favored to last through a long crisis. Cost is a factor in fairness – they often seek the best-value option, not always the absolute best performing if it’s prohibitively expensive for many. Essentially, gear selection in FPA is about balance – every item should earn its place by contributing significantly to survival, comfort, or efficiency, and those chosen are robust enough to trust under duress. Members share reviews and experiences, which the Alliance consolidates into recommendations (like the [[7.41 FPA Approved Gear List]]). The philosophy ensures that group resources aren’t wasted on gimmicks, and that when an emergency comes, everyone’s equipment is up to the task because it was chosen with care and foresight.
