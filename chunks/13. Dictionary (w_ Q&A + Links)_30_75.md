sessions where each person presents something from the base theyâ€™ve tried or mastered, reinforcing its use. They likely use the knowledge base to create standard training curricula for the three tiers (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) so that as you progress, you revisit the base at deeper levels. Given the emphasis on internal links and such, if they use Obsidian or similar, every member can have the vault and cross-reference easily. In essence, the knowledge base is treated as a living commons: everyone feeds it with lessons learned, and everyone draws from it to make plans, with a structure in place to keep it coherent, updated, and accessible regardless of situation (online or offline).
