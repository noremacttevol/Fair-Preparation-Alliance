- **Cybersecurity & Data Protection:** In any tech-forward group, **cybersecurity** is paramount. Tech & App Dev forms the cybersecurity strike team for FPA. They set up firewalls, monitor for intrusion attempts, and maintain the encryption keys and protocols that protect member data. They also educate members on cyber hygiene – simple guides like “Use strong passphrases, don’t share your QR login codes, report lost devices immediately for remote wipe,” etc. If there’s an attempted breach (say a bad actor tries to infiltrate our comms or a government subpoenas our data), the tech team handles it within the bounds of law and security. They ensure that even if servers are seized, the data on them is encrypted and useless without keys (which are distributed, not centralized). They also handle **member anonymity/pseudonymity** features. Some members, for privacy, might operate under callsigns or IDs in the app. Tech ensures the system respects that and only authorized leaders can match real identities when necessary (for trust or vetting). Overall, they cultivate a **hardened digital backbone** for the Alliance – we won’t be taken down by a keyboard attack.
