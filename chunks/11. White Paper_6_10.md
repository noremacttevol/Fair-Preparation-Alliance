- Mark any glaring gaps. Prioritize filling these via recruitment (find someone who has it), training an existing member, or obtaining needed equipment through donation or purchase.  
- Revisit this inventory periodically (people move away, new folks join, someone buys new equipment). Keep it updated so you’re never guessing in a crisis who might handle a task.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If people are shy or modest about their skills, do this as a casual group discussion to draw them out instead of a formal survey. If privacy is a concern (some may not want wider community knowing what they have, like a generator), keep the detailed inventory within the squad only and handle sensitive info respectfully. In the absence of certain critical skills (say no medically trained person at all), contact nearby squads or CERT teams – perhaps an adjacent community’s nurse can advise or assist your squad if needed, forming a mutual aid pact.
