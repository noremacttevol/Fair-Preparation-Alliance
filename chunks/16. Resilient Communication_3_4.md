All ham rigs operate on radio spectrum that is free to use (with a license) and spans short-range VHF/UHF to long-range HF frequencies capable of reaching other continents by bouncing off the ionosphere. Because **virtually all ham rigs can run on 12V DC** (often between 11–16V) ([katrina_hamradio](https://mst.rice.edu/PHYS501/SPR2007Papers/Nkung_kat.pdf#:~:text=morse%20code%2C%20can%20be%20extremely,This%20point%20is%20not%20accidental)), they can be powered from car batteries, solar panels, or generator hookups in the field with ease. This means even in a grid-down scenario, any FPA member with a working car or solar battery can power a ham radio and get on the air. During Katrina, hams used local VHF/UHF frequencies to coordinate within the state and HF frequencies to reach out nationally for help ([katrina_hamradio](https://mst.rice.edu/PHYS501/SPR2007Papers/Nkung_kat.pdf#:~:text=patrol%2C%20and%20other%20federal%2C%20state%2C,hams%20stationed%20themselves%20at%20airports)) – effectively creating an ad-hoc communications web spanning the country. They passed health-and-welfare messages for families, coordinated supply convoys, and even reported critical news (HAMs were first to report the New Orleans levee breaches in Katrina’s aftermath ([Hams in Haiti - IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/hams-in-haiti#:~:text=%E2%80%9DHams%20hold%20down%20the%20fort,chaotic%20aftermath%20of%20the%20hurricane))). All of this happened _without_ phones, internet, or any commercial
