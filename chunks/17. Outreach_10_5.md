**3. QR-to-Offline Nodes:** Marrying the digital and physical, we use **QR codes** in a novel way to bridge online resources with offline availability. Normally, scanning a QR code takes you to a website (which assumes internet). FPA’s innovation is to also set up **offline content nodes** that can be accessed via QR. Here’s how it works: many of our print materials and posters include QR codes that _either_ point to an online URL _or_, if you’re connected to a special FPA local network, to a local resource. For instance, consider a community center that has an FPA “hub box” (perhaps a Raspberry Pi server with a Wi-Fi hotspot but no internet). If internet is up, a person scanning the QR might go to our website’s emergency prep section. But if internet is down, we instruct people to connect to the local FPA hotspot (the SSID would be publicized like “FPA_Offline_Hub”) and then scan – the same QR would direct to a local IP address on that hub, pulling up the data. This dual-function QR ensures **continuity of information access**. We often use QR codes on our laminated guides to say “for more details on topic X, scan here”. Pre-disaster, that gets them to the site (where maybe there’s a full PDF or video). Post-disaster, that same code, via our local nodes, delivers the cached PDF to their phone _over a local Wi-Fi_ (no internet needed). We essentially create a **sneakernet / localnet** distribution of data. Our squads set up these nodes at key spots: one might be in each
