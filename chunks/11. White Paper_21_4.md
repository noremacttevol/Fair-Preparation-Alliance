- Keep relationships warm: attend FEMA workshops, invite officials to observe FPA drills, and maintain a quarterly check-in so the partnership isn’t just on paper.
**Contingency Plan:** If federal bureaucracy stalls (it can), focus on building success at local and state levels – FEMA will eventually take note of a proven track record. Should any government official attempt to direct or control FPA beyond the MOU’s scope (e.g., telling squads they can’t self-deploy when lives are at stake), FPA leadership must diplomatically push back, invoking the independence clause. In scenarios where politics make open partnership risky (perhaps some regimes might distrust citizen groups), FPA can adopt a more informal support role – we’ll still operate, just without public fanfare, coordinating through back-channels if needed. If MOUs are questioned legally, lean on the fact that volunteer efforts are protected under Good Samaritan laws and that FPA is simply an organized extension of neighborly aid. And if all else fails with formal recognition, remember FPA can still do its work without permission – but having even a loose handshake with authorities greatly reduces friction when on the ground.
