- _Lessons Learned:_ **Wireless two-way communication is essential** for a functional squad. Don’t rely solely on cellphones. Family Radio Service (FRS) radios are cheap and license-free, GMRS offers a bit more range (with a simple license), and HAM is excellent for long-range if you have the expertise. A combination can cover your needs. **Lesson:** Start with FRS/GMRS to get everyone comfortable (no barriers to entry), then encourage at least one or two members to pursue an amateur radio license for extended capability. Regular drills on radios will uncover usage issues and build confidence. By Phase 2’s end, the squad should have a basic radio net operational.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Acquire a set of FRS radios (the walkie-talkies sold in electronics stores – no license required up to 2W power). Aim for enough that at least each buddy team in your squad has one. These are relatively low-cost; seek community donations or bulk purchase deals ([A Community Volunteer Radio Network That CAN - Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network](https://fireadaptednetwork.org/a-community-volunteer-radio-network-that-can/#:~:text=neighborhood%20residents%20who%20prefer%20to,that%20their%20radios%20are%20functioning)).
