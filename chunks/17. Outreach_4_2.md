**Offline-First & Stress-Tested:** “Offline and under stress” is our baseline for designing outreach methods. We ask _“Will this work if the power is out? Will this make sense to someone terrified and in the dark at 3 AM?”_ If the answer is no, we rethink it or add a backup. This might mean: if we build a mobile app for emergency tips (as described in the App Whitepaper), it must store critical data on the phone (offline mode) and operate with minimal taps and clear visuals (for use under duress). If we print a guide, we laminate it so water, mud, or tears won’t ruin it. If we record a how-to podcast, we also provide a transcript and distribute it as text via radio teleprinter or SMS, in case people can’t listen but can read a text feed on a basic phone. We constantly simulate worst-case scenarios to improve: we’ll hold surprise drills where a local group has to use only analog tools to get a message out, or cut off the internet during a regional training to see how the network copes. These tests keep us honest about “preparedness for the prepared.” We won’t be caught off guard by foreseeable failures – we plan around them now.  
In summary, FPA’s mission demands that our outreach be **omnipresent (decentralized), honest (transparent), credible (trustworthy), and unkillable (offline-capable)**. The following sections translate these ideals into concrete strategies across different phases of a crisis timeline.
