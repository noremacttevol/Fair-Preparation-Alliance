In summary, **having tools is not enough – using them in concert is what counts**. Ten thousand bullets won’t save you if you’re deaf and blind to the world. But ten people with a thousand bullets collectively and radios linking them can form a defensive network that outlasts and outthinks any single Rambo. FPA chooses the latter path: smart, coordinated, and mission-driven. Our doctrine and all our training aim to turn individual preppers into cohesive squads, and squads into a resilient Alliance. We will not waste; we will coordinate and win.
