Our gear endorsement process doesn’t exist in a vacuum – it’s tightly integrated with the FPA’s broader **trust, firewall, rank, and credit system** as defined in our Trust Doctrine. This integration ensures that the members and information we rely on are trustworthy and that good actors are recognized while bad actors are deterred. Here’s how the systems mesh:  
- **Readiness Cred (Trust Currency):** The FPA uses a reputation-based currency called **Readiness Cred** to quantify each member’s contributions and reliability. Members earn cred by participating constructively – for example, by performing gear tests, providing detailed audit reports, identifying faults, or helping compile results. High cred indicates that a member consistently acts in the Alliance’s best interest. During gear endorsement, Readiness Cred plays a role in **weighting input**: feedback or votes from members who have earned strong credibility (especially in a relevant area, like medical gear or communications gear) may carry more influence in decision-making. _For instance, a long-time member with high cred in “water purification” who reports on a new filter will be heeded strongly._ However, no endorsement decision is ever made by cred alone – it must align with the actual test data and consensus. The trust currency simply helps highlight our most proven contributors so their expertise isn’t lost in the crowd.
