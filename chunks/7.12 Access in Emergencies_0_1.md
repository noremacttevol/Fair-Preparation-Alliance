- Emergency “Cheat Sheets”: The Alliance prepares concise field guides for the most likely scenarios. For example, a hurricane kit might include a laminated sheet of “What to do when the hurricane hits” steps. These cheat sheets boil down info from the vault into immediately actionable checklists or diagrams that are easy to follow under stress.  
- Buddy System for Info: They also encourage that less experienced members pair up with veterans in emergencies. If someone doesn’t have direct access to the knowledge base, their buddy does and can guide them.  
- Caching Knowledge with Gear: In gear caches, not only are supplies stored but also instructions for using them. A medical kit might have a first-aid booklet, a generator in storage has a laminated start-up guide attached, etc.
