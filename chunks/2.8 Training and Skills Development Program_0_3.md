or an advanced firearm tactics class), they return and present key lessons to the group. This multiplies expertise without everyone attending everything. Phase 2 Adaptation: During crisis, training doesn’t stop; it adapts to circumstances. Members continue to learn on the job, and experienced members rotate to ensure less-experienced ones are paired with them in tasks (so learning continues under pressure). Debriefings after events double as training moments – “this is what we did right/wrong and how to do better next time.” Overall, FPA’s training program aims to make each member a well-rounded prepper and to collectively have depth in every crucial skill. It transforms a collection of individuals into a skilled team that can handle a wide array of challenges. As a result, FPA members often become community experts in emergencies – even outside of FPA operations, they can lend a hand, which further solidifies the value of the Alliance’s training ethos.
