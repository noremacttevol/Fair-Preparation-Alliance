FPA has begun integrating small drones and ground robots for reconnaissance and delivery tasks, marking a step into autonomous systems. Quadcopters equipped with cameras give the Alliance “eyes in the sky” to survey damage, locate people, or scout routes without putting a human in harm’s way. An innovation here is to use AI onboard (as noted in [[5.13 Drones and Robotics with AI]]), allowing the drone to identify points of interest (like movement, heat signatures, or specific colors like SOS signals) and perhaps operate with limited input if communications are weak. They’ve also tested fixed-wing drones for longer flight times that could ferry lightweight supplies (like dropping a small first aid kit or note to someone across a flooded area). On the ground, FPA tinkers with remote-controlled rovers – maybe a modified RC car or an open-source robot platform – that can carry loads through rubble or narrow passages. One scenario tested was sending a rover with a two-way radio or phone into a collapsed building where signals from outside couldn’t penetrate, effectively acting as a signal repeater to talk to anyone trapped inside or at least to gauge conditions. These autonomous or semi-autonomous devices are hardened for field use: drones with water-resistant casings, robots with tracks for rough terrain, and all with backup manual control in case AI fails. The alliance also ensures these gadgets can be charged off-grid (portable solar panels, bike generators, etc.). By adding
