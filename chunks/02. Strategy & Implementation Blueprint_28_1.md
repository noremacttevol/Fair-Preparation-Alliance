- **Ethical Guidelines:** The Compass Guide includes a code of ethics for members – honesty, respect, service, preparedness, etc. Violating these ethics undermines trust and thus is taken seriously. This might seem obvious (most groups have codes of conduct), but what matters is enforcement. In FPA, because of our transparency and Tribunal, ethical breaches are hard to hide and will be addressed. Members know this, which deters would-be bad actors from joining or misbehaving, and reassures good actors that they’re in a safe, fair community.  
- **Trust Through Competence:** Finally, a subtle aspect: people trust those who are competent and diligent. By emphasizing training, vetting, and progression, we cultivate competence. A member is more likely to trust their squadmate who has demonstrated skill in a drill, or an AI that has proven accurate over dozens of queries. Thus, operational excellence is itself a trust-building mechanism. Our doctrine, by formalizing training and improvement, indirectly but powerfully enhances trust in each other’s abilities.
