- **War Gaming and Scenario Outreach:** In preparation mode, we also run scenario-based communication drills. For example, we simulate a scenario like “grid-down for 72 hours after cyber attack” and practice our outreach: which channels do we use first? What pre-scripted messages do we send? Are our phone trees up to date? We treat misinformation as an adversary in these war games, practicing how we’d counter rumors (e.g., if a fake message goes out that a dam is breaking, how do we quickly verify and correct it with our trusted channels?). By running these drills publicly or semi-publicly, they double as outreach events themselves. We might invite community members to participate (“This Saturday, join us in a city-wide blackout simulation – test your preparedness and communication!”). This not only tests our readiness but raises awareness in a hands-on way.  
In pre-event outreach, **success is measured by growth of the network and depth of trust**. Are more people attending each workshop? Do we see user-generated content (a great sign – like a local member writing their own blog about what they learned from FPA, meaning they’ve internalized it)? Did a neighborhood start a community emergency plan after engaging with us? We track these because when the storm clouds gather, these are the assets that will pay off.
