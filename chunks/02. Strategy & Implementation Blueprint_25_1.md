- **Appeals and Grievances:** Members can appeal to the Tribunal if they believe a decision affecting them was unjust (like if a leader removed them from a squad unfairly, or if they suspect a transparency log has been tampered with). The Tribunal acts as the ultimate internal court of appeal.  
- **Oversight of Leadership and AI:** The Tribunal keeps an eye on leadership performance and the AI systems. It receives regular reports (some generated by the system, some by whistleblowers or observers) about these. For instance, if an AI module is frequently flagging content incorrectly, the Tribunal can demand a review or rollback of that AI feature. If a leader or committee is exceeding their authority, the Tribunal can check them. In severe cases, the Tribunal can suspend a leader pending a membership vote to remove or replace that leader.  
- **Policy and Doctrine Guardianship:** Changes to this Strategy Blueprint or the Trust Doctrine itself often require Tribunal review and recommendation before being presented to membership. The Tribunal ensures that proposed changes donâ€™t undermine core principles. They can also issue interpretations or guidance on grey areas (similar to a supreme court clarifying a constitution). These interpretations are logged and added to the Compass Guide for reference.
