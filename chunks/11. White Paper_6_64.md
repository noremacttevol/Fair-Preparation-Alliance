- If an Outernet device is acquired, set it up at a member’s home or squad base with a clear view of the sky. Test it and start downloading useful content. Many such devices broadcast a local Wi-Fi signal – you can connect a tablet or phone to read the downloaded info.  
- Curate what info to gather: weather forecasts, emergency alerts (some feeds like GDACS or ReliefWeb offer global disaster alerts), medical references from WikiMed (offline medical Wikipedia), etc. Also, include FPA’s own Compass Guide digital copy so you have all best practices on hand without internet.  
- Train at least two tech-savvy members on operating and troubleshooting the system. Write a short manual in case they’re not available when needed.  
- Plan how to disseminate the received info to the community. For example: if a major storm forecast comes in via satellite while everything else is down, the squad will update the physical info board (Milestone 20) and perhaps do a round of public announcements (even with a bullhorn or driving around with a speaker). Essentially, integrate Outernet data into your comms plan.
