they have no one knowledgeable in, say, wild foraging, they might seek out training or recruit someone new with that skill. It’s also a morale booster – members feel valued for the skills they bring, not just seen as generic bodies. Privacy is respected (the skill list isn’t public-facing outside FPA), but within the group it’s accessible so that even if people haven’t met, they know “Oh, Alice is our herbal medicine guru, I’ll reach out to her for this question.” By mapping out human capabilities, FPA ensures that knowledge isn’t just in documents, but embodied in people and that those people can be identified and tapped when their know-how is needed most. It turns the alliance into a well-rounded team where one person’s strength covers another’s weakness, and collectively, they have an expert in nearly every facet of survival and resilience.
