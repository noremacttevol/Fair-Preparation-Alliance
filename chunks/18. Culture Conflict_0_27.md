Two teams are about to deploy a joint initiative, but a dispute over data privacy arises with some members feeling the plan violates our ethics. An engineer calls a Pause on the deployment. This triggers an immediate review involving the Trust Liaison and the Ethics Committee from governance. They discuss the concern, adjust the plan to resolve the ethical issue, and only then is the project un-paused and allowed to proceed. The Pause Protocol builds resilience by preventing hasty actions that could splinter trust, and by institutionalizing the principle that addressing ethical and interpersonal concerns comes before business as usual.
