- **“Founding Member” Experimental Tier:** _(Experimental / Pending Consensus)_ In our early formation we’ve acknowledged a special, **temporary tier** for the original founding contributors – tongue-in-cheek we’ve called it the “Founding Father” tier (name likely to change to something more inclusive). This is a **test initiative** to reward those who put in significant time or resources at the very start. The concept is that founding contributors might have certain perks or voting privileges in the first year, and **in return for their early dues or donations, they could get a future membership dues credit or partial refund** if they step away. The idea is to honor early risk-takers without creating permanent nobility. _For example, if John and Jane each contributed $500 in seed funding to kickstart FPA’s app development, they might receive a “Founding Member” status that lets them recoup that investment from membership fees over time or have first say in some pilot programs._ However, let’s be clear: this tier **does not confer any permanent governance power** beyond the initial phase. It’s being tried out as a way to balance financial fairness and recognition. **This feature is experimental and will be adjusted or discontinued based on member feedback and a formal vote by the end of the year.** We tag it clearly to avoid confusion: no one wants an entrenched privileged class here, and we will shut it down if it even _smells_ like that.
