To support members who are off-grid, FPA plans to utilize low-bandwidth broadcast services (such as the “**Outernet**”) to push updates and information. _Outernet_, broadly speaking, is a concept for broadcasting internet content via satellite or other means for one-way offline reception (i.e., users with a simple receiver can get data without needing a two-way internet connection). In our context, if a member has an FPA-issued portable data receiver (or even just a radio tuned to FPA’s channel), we could periodically broadcast updates that include new training material or even updates to personal skill data, in a secure form.  
For instance, suppose a member in the field completes a drill and later comes within range of a field HQ or relay – their device might send a tiny packet of data (“Member #12345 completed Drill X”). At the next scheduled Outernet broadcast, FPA could beam out an updated skill summary for that member (encrypted for their device). When the member’s receiver picks up that transmission, their offline app or device would update to show the new achievement. In another case, regular broadcasts might include generic updates like, “New chapter on cyber-security added to SHTF Bible, here’s the text,” or urgent alerts like, “Hurricane incoming – all coastal members, review your Comms and Medical segments now.”
