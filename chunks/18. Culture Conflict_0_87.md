Leadership Code of Conduct: Leaders sign on to an explicit code that they will uphold the values and foster the culture. It includes clauses like “Leaders shall not retaliate against those who disagree or raise concerns; leaders shall actively participate in conflict resolution processes and not exempt themselves.” Violations of this code carry clear consequences (from formal warnings to removal). Importantly, any leader who tries to short-circuit the conflict process (for example, preventing a subordinate from escalating a complaint) is breaching the code. We give others in the organization the right and duty to call out such breaches. For instance, if a circle lead tells a team member “Don’t take this issue to the Trust Liaison, just drop it,” that team member (or the Liaison if they hear of it) should report this interference to higher authorities. The framework then protects the whistleblower and addresses the leader’s misconduct separately. No leader is allowed to be the final judge of their own case – that’s a principle we hold. So if a complaint is about a leader, that leader cannot be the one to decide the outcome; it will always be handled by peers or higher levels.
