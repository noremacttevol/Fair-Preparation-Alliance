- **Transparency & Feedback:** The app now features a **Live Audit Feed** showing key metrics and decisions (membership count, fee changes, recent community votes) to all members ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=%20section%20iv:%20governance%20&,the%20fpa%20live%20audit%20feed-1l001i/)). This builds trust by making growth and governance visible. Users can also give feedback on the AI guidance (e.g. rating chatbot answers “helpful” or not) ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=%20personalization%20enhancements:%20expanded%20examples,location%20to%20tailor%20disaster%20advice-l898h/)), creating a loop to improve the system. Regular surveys or town-hall style polls might be conducted in-app to keep leadership informed of member sentiment.
