Because we put trust over control, **who we trust in which role really matters**. The FPA uses a role-based authority system with built-in checks and **expiration dates** – ensuring that power doesn’t concentrate or linger unchallenged. Here’s how we manage roles and keep leaders accountable:  
- **Clear Role Definitions:** Every official role in FPA (from a local Squad Leader to a national Coordinator) has a written description of its **scope of authority, duties, and limits**. These definitions are public to all members. If you take on a role, you and everyone else knows exactly what you can decide on your own and what requires wider input or approval. For example, a Logistics Circle Lead might be allowed to authorize use of regional stockpiled supplies during an emergency, but purchasing new major equipment might require a council vote. By setting these boundaries upfront, we prevent power grabs and confusion. _It’s not personal authority – it’s the role speaking._ If you step out of your lane, members will call you on it because the lane markings are visible to everyone.
