their decisions to the group as soon as feasible to maintain trust. There are also checks and balances: if a decision is controversial, members can appeal it up the chain or ask for a review by the leadership council, ensuring accountability (related to [[Accountability and Transparency]]). At times, formal guidelines are documented: the [[Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)]] includes a section on decision hierarchy (e.g., life-or-death immediate decisions defer to whoever is on scene and qualified, whereas long-term policy changes require broad input). Importantly, FPA’s decision-making is guided by its values – any proposal is measured against the mission and core principles from [[Core Values and Principles]] to ensure alignment. This process has allowed FPA to be both participatory and decisive, avoiding paralysis by analysis but also avoiding authoritarian rule. (See also: [[Member Participation in Governance]], [[Conflict Resolution and Discipline]] for how disagreements in decisions are handled.)
