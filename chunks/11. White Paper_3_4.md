**Phase1.2: Ensure 100% of members complete a Personal Emergency Plan review (“Test My Plan”) by Q4 2024.**
_Real-world example:_ Imagine a family who thought they were prepared: they had some food, a generator, and an evacuation plan to drive to Aunt Sue’s house. Then a real flood hit. In the chaos, they discovered the generator was out of fuel, their evacuation route was underwater, and they had never arranged a backup place to stay. Such failures are common when plans aren’t stress-tested. To prevent this, FPA created the **“Test My Plan”** initiative – essentially a guided dry-run of your personal emergency plan. One member in Oregon did a 48-hour off-grid test during a winter storm; he found that his backup heat source wasn’t sufficient below freezing. Thanks to the test, he rectified that (got extra propane and blankets) _before_ a real blizzard hit. The goal is for every member to uncover and fix weaknesses in their plan now, rather than during an actual disaster.
