- **FPA App Development & Maintenance:** Tech & App Dev are the custodians of the **FPA App** – the mobile/PC application introduced in Phase2 and continuously improved. They write the code, squash the bugs, and push the updates. The app itself is a multifaceted tool: it includes secure messaging, event scheduling, a library of resources (manuals, how-to guides, maps), an SOS alert feature, and modules for logging activities and AP. This team ensures the app remains **offline-first and secure**. For example, they design the database to run locally on phones, with sync protocols that work over any network (Wi-Fi, cellular, mesh, even acoustic modem over radio if needed). They also implement encryption (likely using robust open-source crypto libraries) so that even if a device is captured, without the member’s key it yields nothing useful. In Phase3, the app might have advanced AI capabilities embedded – Tech & App Dev makes sure those models run locally if needed, so advice is available even off-grid. User feedback flows to this team constantly, and they iterate quickly to add features that field members need.
