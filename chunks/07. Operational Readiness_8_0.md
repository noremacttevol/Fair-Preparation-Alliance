Even in worst-case failures, FPA has redundancies at every layer. The table below outlines common failure modes and our countermeasures:  
|**Failure Scenario**|**FPA Countermeasure**|
|---|---|
|**Power Outage**|Battery backups: hand-crank generators, solar chargers, vehicle inverters to power gear.|
|**Internet Down**|Radio networks fill the gap: HAM and VHF communication, plus printed SOPs for guidance (offline workflow).|
|**App/System Failure**|Pre-printed materials: every team has offline kits and task cards to continue operations without the app.|
|**AI Corruption**|Human override: local squad councils assume decision-making, and any AI guidance is halted until verified (following the [[Trust Doctrine]] protocols).|  
In short, for each critical dependency, thereâ€™s a fallback. If one link breaks, another mechanism (human or analog) is in place to keep operations moving safely.
