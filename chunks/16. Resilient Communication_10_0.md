This Communications Readiness & Resilience Doctrine has detailed the what, why, and how of keeping the Alliance connected through any crisis. Now we emphasize the endstate: this isn’t just a document to read – it’s a doctrine to **live and drill** continuously. The ultimate measure of readiness is execution under pressure. We bridge planning and action by making these procedures second nature: _we train as we intend to fight, and we fight (or survive) by our training_. Every FPA member, from the newest recruit to the highest commander, has a role in this communications web, and only through collective diligence do the individual strands form an unbreakable network.  
**No tool works without a practiced hand.** Owning a radio is not enough; one must know its feel in the dark, the sound of a clear vs. a weak signal, the cadence of proper net call-ups. Having a Faraday cage is useless if you never store your gear in it or don’t know how to quickly retrieve items when needed. Thus, repetition and realism in practice are key. We expect all chapters to incorporate communications scenarios in every major exercise: lights-out nights, EMP simulators (even if just imagination – “Pretend your phone is fried now, what do you do?”), surprise radio-only musters, etc. Leaders at all levels must evaluate and mentor their teams in these situations. Weaknesses found are not to punish but to improve – better to lose comms in a drill and learn from it than in reality.
