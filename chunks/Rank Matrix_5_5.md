**Time-Limited Roles and Returning to Enlisted:** Officer roles are not permanent promotions – they are positions of service. Many officer roles have term limits or mission-specific durations. After fulfilling an officer term, a member might either be re-elected/appointed to continue, move to a higher office, or step back. If they step back, typically they retain their E-10 Master status (and of course the experience gained). In this way, **rank = contribution, not privilege** – holding an officer rank is about serving the Alliance, not gaining personal perks. Officers are expected to meet higher standards of conduct and transparency since they are entrusted with leading peers.
