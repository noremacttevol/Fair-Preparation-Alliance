In all this, we integrate with **Trust Doctrine**: communications, especially in a fragmented scenario, must be truthful and verified. Leaders must avoid rumors; they should confirm reports with at least one other source or scout before acting. For example, if one squad reports “large gang moving north,” another squad should attempt to verify via eyes or another channel before the whole community evacuates and possibly falls for a false alarm. We build in verification steps: requiring at least two independent reports for big decisions if at all possible. This is communicated to all members: don’t spread unverified info on the net – label it as unconfirmed if you do (“Condition: Rumor, content: X, source: unverified”). Our trust web relies on honesty about what we know and don’t know.  
Finally, **morale** over the network is a factor. Community formation means maintaining not just technical links but human bonds. A radio net shouldn’t be pure tactical talk; occasional encouragement, a bit of humanity, keeps people connected. Leadership should signal hope as well – e.g., sharing positive developments (“The spring still has water, over”) to balance dire news. A quiet, disciplined but also _compassionate_ communication style will keep the community functional over time. That is strategic realism: acknowledging hardship while galvanizing collective spirit.
