Q33: What is an emergency evacuation plan and how do I make one?
A: It’s a predetermined plan for how you and your family will get out of danger and where you’ll go in an emergency. Instead of figuring things out in the moment (when everyone’s panicked), you’ve mapped it out ahead of time. A good evacuation plan covers the key details: when to evacuate (the trigger – e.g. fire alarm, flood warning, official order), how to evacuate (the routes you’ll take out of your home and neighborhood, with backups if roads are blocked), where to go (a safe destination, like a relative’s house or designated shelter, and a meeting point in case family members get separated), and how to communicate (ensuring everyone can check in, perhaps via phone or an out-of-area contact). By having an evacuation plan and practicing it, you won’t waste time wondering what to do – everyone will know how to get out quickly and where to regroup. [#Beginner] [#Preparedness]
