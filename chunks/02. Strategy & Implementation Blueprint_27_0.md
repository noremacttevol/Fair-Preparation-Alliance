Transparency is only meaningful if it’s backed by concrete tools – that’s where **transparency logs** come in:  
- **Comprehensive Logging:** As noted, most significant events and decisions are logged. This includes:  
- Operations logs (drills, missions, outcomes).  
- Decision logs (meeting minutes of leadership councils, Tribunal verdicts, policy changes).  
- System logs (AI updates, app version changes, detected security incidents).  
- Financial/resource logs (if applicable – e.g., how resources in a cache were allocated, or donations spent – even though financial aspects are not our focus here, if it exists it’s logged).  
- Membership changes (new members, progression achievements, departures – though personal reasons might be private, the fact that someone progressed or left is recorded).  
- **Member Access:** Every member has access to the logs through the app or requesting a physical print if needed. The logs are organized for usability – an interface to search and filter by category and date. This prevents information overload. For example, a member can easily pull up “all policy changes in the last month” or “outcome of last quarter’s multi-squad drill” without sifting through irrelevant data. We invest in making transparency **user-friendly**.
