**2. Laminated Micro-Guides:** As mentioned, one hallmark of FPA is the use of durable micro-guides. These are essentially **micro-publications**: small form factor (perhaps pocket-sized or a folded roadmap size) references that are laminated or otherwise made rugged. The reason for lamination and small size is simple: we expect these to live in wallets, bug-out bags, glove compartments – and to survive rough conditions. Some examples of micro-guides we deploy: “The 5 Pillars of Survival” quick reference, a First Aid mini-manual, a “Comms Cheat Sheet” listing emergency frequencies and Morse code, etc. We even have a micro-guide on “FPA Doctrine & Signals,” which concisely states our core principles and the meaning of any special codes or symbols we use in communications (so someone finding it can quickly understand how to engage or decode an FPA message). These guides are unique because they distill _a lot_ of expertise into a very compact and indestructible form. To produce them, we curated content from our **Dictionary**, **SHTF Bible**, and other detailed sources and condensed it. We periodically update them as needed (offering updated versions to members), but we also ensure even older versions remain broadly useful (timeless info). In outreach events, handing someone a laminated card with life-saving info is not only practical, it’s symbolic – it’s like handing them a _membership card in the prepared community_. People tend to keep such items. And when all else is
