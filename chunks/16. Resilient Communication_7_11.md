By end of Phase 3, the individual is essentially a **Communications Leader** – capable of running the show for their squad or even coordinating between multiple squads. If a disaster struck and all higher command was silent, a Phase 3 person could feasibly organize local units and establish a working comms network from scratch, using their knowledge of equipment, protocols, and leadership.  
**Phase 4 – Alliance Network Strategist (ORP IV: Commander/Strategist):** Not everyone will reach Phase 4; this is the realm of senior leadership, where broad strategy and inter-regional coordination come in. In communications terms, Phase 4 members are the architects and stewards of the entire Alliance communications strategy. Their training/role is less about operating a radio (by now that’s second nature) and more about **planning large-scale networks and ensuring interoperability at all levels**.  
- **Doctrine and Policy Formulation:** Phase 4 comms specialists contribute to writing documents like this one. They refine the communication doctrine over time, incorporate lessons learned from exercises or real incidents, and ensure consistency with our other doctrines (Trust, Compass, etc.). They might lead after-action reviews following drills to capture what went wrong or right in communications and update procedures accordingly.
