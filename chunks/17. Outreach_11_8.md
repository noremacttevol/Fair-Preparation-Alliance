**The Doctrine Lives in People:** Ultimately, the concept is that the FPA doctrine – our principles and plans – should not only live in written documents or cloud servers. It should live in the **minds and hearts of people** such that even if all paper and digital copies burned up, the mission would continue from human memory and conviction. This sounds almost like how religious or philosophical movements endure: through disciples and oral tradition when needed. We indeed take inspiration from that – think of how, historically, important knowledge was preserved by individuals who memorized texts (like medieval bards or scholars) or how communities maintained rituals under oppression when they couldn’t openly share written instructions. We’re not aiming for that level of adversity, but being prepared for worst-case includes even that. So we might even encourage key members to memorize certain critical protocols or to have redundant personal copies tucked away.  
In treating our volunteers and followers as future teachers and leaders, not just recipients, we create a living network of _human_ resilience. This is the opposite of, say, a large Twitter following that evaporates if the internet goes out. Instead, you have, in each locale, a human who embodies the knowledge and can rally others with or without tech. That is the power of building interpreters, and that is how FPA’s message can survive and spread under the harshest conditions.
