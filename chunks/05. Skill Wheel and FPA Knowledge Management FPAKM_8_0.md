Based on the member’s identified skill gaps and personal context, FPAi will also suggest a tailored **Personalized Learning Path**. This is essentially a custom training and development plan generated for the individual. It could include recommended training courses, specific study materials, or even mission assignments that would help boost particular segments of their Skill Wheel.  
For example, if the AI flags that a member’s First Aid skills are low relative to the flood risks in their region, it might recommend something like: _“Complete the Flood Response First Aid module (see Chapter4 of the [[SHTF Bible]]) and attend the upcoming Red Cross disaster medicine workshop in your area.”_ If Navigation is the weak link for someone living in wildfire country, the AI might suggest, _“Join the next orienteering hike with your local FPA squad to practice land navigation.”_ These suggestions essentially create a **custom curriculum** for each member, focusing their efforts on the most impactful improvements first – much like a personal coach saying “here’s your next drill.” The recommendations will draw from FPA’s own resources (like chapters of the SHTF Bible, local FPA training events) as well as external opportunities (reputable courses or certifications) to fill in the gaps.
