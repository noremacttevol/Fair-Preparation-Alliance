C. Integrating Values and Doctrines  
Our conflict handling methods do not stand in isolation – they are the practical expression of FPA’s core values as laid out in our foundational doctrines:  
Trust Doctrine: The norms defined in the Trust Doctrine (such as honesty, promise-keeping, and assuming good intent) are actively applied in every conflict situation. For example, one provision of the Trust Doctrine is that members will not speak ill of others behind their backs – instead, they will address issues directly or seek mediation. Accordingly, this framework prohibits gossip as a way to deal with conflict; it channels members toward face-to-face resolution or facilitated dialogue, which builds trust rather than eroding it. Trust is also protected by requiring confidentiality in sensitive proceedings (so people can open up without fear of rumors) and by ensuring follow-through on any agreements (so that trust, once rebuilt, is justified by actions). In essence, the Trust Doctrine provides the ethical compass for how we treat one another during conflict: with sincerity, respect, and a focus on mending rather than blaming.
