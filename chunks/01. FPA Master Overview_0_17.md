Transparency and Trust: Every dollar collected through dues is tracked on our live audit feed (first introduced in Phase2). Members can see in real time exactly how funds are allocated: server costs this month, aid sent to flood victims, bulk food purchases for regional caches, etc. Nothing is a mystery. Because of our cap system, if a surge of new members joins, members will literally watch their own dues decrease in the next billing cycle. It’s almost unheard of – an organization charging you less as it grows – but that’s our promise. We exist only to make communities readier and safer, not to line anyone’s pockets.
