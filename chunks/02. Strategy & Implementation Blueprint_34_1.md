- Members have the responsibility to train, to follow SOPs, to prepare their backup plans, to log truthfully, and to watch out for the integrity of the group.  
This Blueprint will be reviewed by the founding FPA membership and ratified as our guiding framework. From there, it will live in our daily actions and be referenced in our toughest decisions. It is deliberately written in plain, direct language – we want it to be understood and scrutinized by all. In fact, we invite critical review of this document: if you find something lacking or unclear, that is exactly the kind of feedback that our Living System Clause welcomes and that will make the next version even stronger.  
As we move forward, let this Blueprint remind us that **resilience is not just about tools or tactics, but about trust and teamwork**. By adhering to these principles and structures, we ensure that FPA remains grounded, realistic, and ready for whatever comes. Together, guided by this Blueprint, we will operationalize our mission in the real world – making our communities safer, our technology accountable, and our membership empowered.  
_Adopted by the Founding Membership on 20250501_, this Blueprint is henceforth the supreme guiding document of the FPA. All subsequent charters, manuals, and protocols derive from it and must remain consistent with its letter and spirit. We will uphold it, defend it, and improve it as a living document – just as we build and safeguard the future of the FPA itself.
