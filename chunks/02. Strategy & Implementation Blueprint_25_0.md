The **Tribunal** is the highest oversight and adjudication body in FPA, a key pillar of the Trust Doctrine in action:  
- **Composition:** The Tribunal is composed of experienced, respected members (often Phase IV leaders or founding members initially). Ideally it has a small odd number of people (e.g., 5 or 7) to deliberate on issues. Tribunal members are selected through a process agreed upon by the membership – possibly elected at large or appointed by regional councils with membership ratification. The selection process itself is transparent, with criteria like experience, track record of fairness, and broad trust within the community.  
- **Role and Powers:** The Tribunal’s mandate is to **safeguard the principles of the FPA and resolve issues that go beyond individual squads.** It does not micromanage daily operations – rather, it intervenes when an incident or decision has organization-wide implications or when trust might be at stake. For example:  
- Handling **Disciplinary Cases:** If a member violates core principles (e.g., steals equipment, consistently endangers others, or breaches privacy rules), and the issue cannot be resolved at squad level, the Tribunal reviews the case. It hears all sides (the member can defend themselves). Outcomes can range from mandated training, probation, up to expulsion from FPA in extreme cases. All such proceedings are documented (with sensitive personal details protected as appropriate) so others see that justice was done.
