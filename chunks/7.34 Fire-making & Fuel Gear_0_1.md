- Fire Safety Gear: A collapsible shovel (to manage campfire and cover with dirt) and a bucket or container for water/sand are often on hand to fully extinguish fires. Also, knowledge of clearing a fire ring and wind management is imparted.
Members practice fire-making under various conditions (after rain, at night quickly, with one hand simulated injury, etc.). Having multiple ignition sources ensures they can always create flame â€“ critical for survival. In essence, FPA treats fire-making as a fundamental skill and equips each person to confidently and safely spark a life-sustaining fire whenever needed.
