Training Programs & Curriculum: This team designs and delivers the training curriculum for FPA members at all levels. It starts with basics (a “Prepper Boot Camp” for new recruits covering water purification, basic first aid, fire-making, etc.) and goes up to advanced courses (e.g. Small Unit Tactics, Advanced Trauma Medicine, Radio Operator Certification). They collaborate with subject-matter experts (often senior members or trusted external experts) to develop courses. The curriculum is standardized so an FPA member in Oregon gains the same core skills as one in Florida, but it’s also adaptive: if certain regions face specific threats (wildfires in the West, hurricanes in the Southeast), training emphasizes those scenarios locally. Readiness doesn’t believe in “online-only” learning – while materials might be available in the app, every key skill must be practiced physically. They schedule regular hands-on workshops and field exercises. Even something like cybersecurity has a real-world drill (e.g. practicing secure comms in the field or simulating a lost laptop scenario). The motto is “Train as we fight, fight as we train” – realism is baked into all training.
