- **Advanced Dashboards for Command:** At this stage, we can develop higher-level views for regional and national leadership. These dashboards would aggregate data in anonymized form to give a picture of FPA’s overall readiness. For instance, national HQ might see a “Skill Readiness Index” by region – highlighting if a particular region is lagging in medical training, or if another region excels in navigation, etc. This helps in resource allocation (e.g., sending traveling instructors to the areas that need improvement). We will implement these carefully to avoid any misuse of data – it’s meant for supporting and focusing training efforts, not for shaming chapters. Any public or organization-wide stats will be anonymized and framed positively (like identifying needs and offering help).
