- **AI Oversight Committee:** Given the heavy integration of AI in Phase3, Governance & Oversight likely has a sub-committee specifically for **AI oversight**. This group reviews the algorithms and data to ensure no bias or unethical decision-making is creeping in. They set rules for AI use – for example, “AI can never be used to identify individuals for any punitive action without human investigation,” or “AI cannot override a human order unless life is in immediate danger and even then must alert human oversight.” They treat the AI kind of like another member or officer that needs evaluation. If an AI module is consistently giving questionable advice, they can order it retrained or shut down. All AI-driven decisions above a threshold likely trigger an automatic report to this committee for review. Essentially, they ensure our embrace of AI **never compromises human judgment or alliance values**.
