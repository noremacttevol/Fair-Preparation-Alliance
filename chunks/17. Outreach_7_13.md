- The local squad switches on a **satellite receiver** and pulls down the latest national FPA bulletin via Outernet, which includes a safety message and a weather update that perhaps the local news can’t transmit. They print it and post it at the shelter.  
- They also radio out on the agreed HAM frequency to report their status (“Town X: flooding in low areas, approx 50 people at community center, need drinking water”). Another FPA operator 100 miles away hears this and relays it to state authorities or FPA central via HF radio.  
- Meanwhile, our team activates a **neighborhood patrol**: two volunteers go street by street with a bullhorn (battery-powered) announcing key points: “Power is out, estimated 3 days. Do not drink tap water without boiling. Come to the fire station at noon for updates.” They carry a stack of our laminated guides and hand out water purification cards to anyone who needs one, explaining verbally as well.
