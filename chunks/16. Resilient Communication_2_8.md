and fragility of AC inverters. Fewer complex electronics in the system means fewer failure points under EMP. A basic setup could be: a 100W folding solar panel feeding a charge controller, charging a 50Ah LiFePO4 battery, which directly runs your 12V radio and an LED lantern, and also charges handheld radios or tablets via car-plug adapters. This entire setup can be EMP-hardened: keep a spare charge controller and adapter cables in a Faraday bag, and perhaps even the solar panel rolled up in a grounded metal tube. Should an EMP strike, you might lose the controller in use, but your spare from the cage can be deployed within minutes to restore solar charging capability. In the field, **12V DC is our standard** for interoperability â€“ it allows vehicle batteries, solar units, and even hand-crank generators to all feed our equipment pool.
