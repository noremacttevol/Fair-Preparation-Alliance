- Identify sympathetic officials or emergency managers (some may have seen FPA in action locally). Use those champions to get introductions at higher levels. If possible, secure a meeting between FPA national leaders and FEMA’s volunteer liaison or even Administrator to discuss collaboration.  
- Work state by state as needed: have regional FPA leads approach their state emergency management offices to be included in state disaster plans. Show up at state-run drills or planning meetings to make FPA known.  
- Once interest is established, formalize it: sign MOUs or letters of agreement with clear language that FPA remains an independent volunteer entity but will coordinate through established structures (like reporting to the local Incident Command Post when responding, etc.). Also clarify liability and safety expectations so everyone is comfortable.  
- Place liaisons: designate experienced FPA members who can represent us in emergency operations centers. Train them in ICS (Incident Command System) jargon so they can interface professionally. Get them badged if required for EOC access ahead of time.  
- Integrate communication: ensure FPA’s radio frequencies or contacts are known to FEMA’s communication unit leaders, and vice versa. Possibly tie into FEMA’s radio plans (like RACES frequencies) during big events so information can be shared.
