Consider some scenarios to illustrate how the app and AI come together:  
- **Missing Person Search:** A child is missing after a storm in a neighborhood. Squad members use the app to coordinate a search grid – there’s a map where each member marks areas searched. They use the AI to remind them of best practices for search and rescue (like how to call out, what signs to look for, how to avoid getting lost themselves). One member finds faint footprints in mud; she snaps a photo and while offline, the AI can’t do cloud image recognition, but she describes it and it helps deduce the direction (suggesting based on terrain likely heading downhill towards water). The child is found safe, and the app documents the timeline which later goes into an after-action debrief.  
- **Resource Allocation:** There’s been a supply drop of relief goods in town (assume authorities or a charity came through). Through the app, Chapter coordinators list what’s available at the drop point. The dynamic pricing logic in the app (Chapter 10) allocates those resources: families in more affected zones get priority or subsidized points to claim items. The AI assists by forecasting needs: it might suggest “Area 5 still has no running water, allocate more water purifiers there, whereas Area 3 grocery# Fair Preparation Alliance – Mk1Mod3 Framework Handbook
