A: For FPA, a bug-out vehicle (BOV) is a means to evacuate efficiently, and they treat it as an important asset but one with limitations. They advise members to get their vehicles ready for emergencies if possible: keeping the gas tank at least half full at all times, having a vehicle emergency kit (tools, spare tire, jumper cables, fuel can, etc.), and maybe even storing extra fuel safely. For those who can afford it or need it, some might have more specialized BOVs (like off-road capable trucks, campers, or motorcycles that can weave through traffic). FPA likely shares tips on how to harden a vehicle for crisis – e.g., roof racks with extra supplies, hidden compartments, or even modest armor if someone goes that far – though not everyone will do those. Importantly, FPA training would cover when to use a vehicle and when not to: in some scenarios, roads will be parking lots, so a good on-foot plan (with a get-home bag or bug-out bag) is crucial too. They might have convoy protocols where groups of members plan to travel together for safety if evacuating. Also, alternate vehicles (bicycles, boats, etc.) come into play depending on region. While some individual preppers turn their trucks into Mad Max rigs, FPA’s collective wisdom is probably: make your vehicle reliable and ready, but don’t overly rely on it – always have a backup plan if you have to ditch it or if fuel runs out. They also emphasize that a BOV is only as good as knowing where you’re bugging out to (your BOL).
