4. Scaling Logistics: Volunteer Burnout + Quality Drift  
Real Threat Level: High (but surmountable)  
Why it’s real: CERT barely held together a few thousand programs with FEMA backing. You’re talking tens of thousands, with complex AI + rank + gear + printing + radio layers.  
Where you're strong: You've embedded redundancy in roles, layered squads into a federated structure, and trained for rank-to-role alignment.  
Still weak?: Long-term retention requires meaningful feedback loops. Your AP system and drills are solid—but you may need to add mental health fatigue detection, flexible leave systems, and family-level rewards to avoid burnout.

5. Public Legitimacy: Fringe or Future?  
Real Threat Level: Moderate  
Why it’s real: Without mainstream adoption, FPA remains fringe and at risk of being labeled extremist or conspiracy-based during a political panic.  
Where you’re strong: The memetic narrative is slowly being built through fairness, transparency, and public wins (e.g. Ohio blackout case study).  
Still weak?: You’ll need pilot success stories and non-scary ambassadors (teachers, nurses, clergy) to counterbalance the prepper stereotype. The SHTF Bible might be intimidating by name alone—have a “Family Edition” brand for civilians.
