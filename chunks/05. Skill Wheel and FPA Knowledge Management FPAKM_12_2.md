These Skill Cards would be formatted for easy printing (e.g. black-and-white friendly, minimal fancy graphics). Members could print and laminate them to carry in a go-bag or include in their emergency binder. The content for these cards would be generated by pulling from our knowledge base as appropriate. The _SHTF Bible_ (FPA’s comprehensive survival manual) is structured into chapters and modules on various threats and skills. Our Knowledge Management System knows which sections correspond to which skills. So, if FPAi determines “this member needs a refresher on X,” the system can automatically excerpt key points from the relevant SHTF Bible chapter to include on their card. It’s essentially an automated _“extract and summarize”_ process tailored to the individual. In Phase1, doing this might involve an instructor manually selecting relevant pages for a member. By Phase3, it will be fully AI-driven and kept up-to-date whenever the member’s profile changes.
