**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** We plan to **formalize and expand these protocols** as AI’s role grows. In the coming month: (a) Schedule **monthly AI Audits** – a thorough review of a random sample of AI interactions each month by the committee, with findings and recommended fixes published internally. (Previously it was ad hoc; now it will be regular.) (b) Develop an **AI Incident Response Plan**: if a member reports a potentially harmful AI suggestion, we have a procedure to immediately halt similar advice, notify users who might have received it, and correct the issue. We thankfully haven’t needed this yet, but we want it defined. (c) Increase **member education** about the AI’s limits – perhaps a short required tutorial before using FPAi the first time, emphasizing critical thinking and not relying solely on AI. Also on the tech side, we’re working on a **“AI Oversight Dashboard”** for the committee, which will have real-time analytics on AI usage, common questions, any spikes in strange outputs, etc., to proactively spot issues. In 30 days, we aim to have that dashboard up and running. We’ll also invite a couple more members with diverse backgrounds (perhaps a psychologist and a long-time community elder) to join the Oversight Committee to broaden perspective on what is “good” advice. Additionally, we will document these protocols in an official **FPA AI Governance Charter** to be ratified by leadership – solidifying our commitment. By the end of the month, with FPAi
