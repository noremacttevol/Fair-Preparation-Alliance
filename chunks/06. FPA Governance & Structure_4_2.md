- **Core Members:** After proving themselves, members become Core (full) Members. Core Members are the backbone of FPA – they have voting rights in local decisions, can take on circle roles, and can access the full resources and knowledge base of the alliance. Most of our governance processes (like electing circle leads or ratifying policies) are driven by Core Members. We emphasize that _with rank comes responsibility_: Core Members are expected to stay active, continue learning, and uphold alliance ethics. In return, they are trusted as equal peers in running and improving FPA. There’s usually no further hierarchy needed for most purposes – one Core Member, one vote in any democratic process. However, for operational efficiency and to recognize expertise, we do have **advanced ranks** for those who take on major leadership or specialized roles.
