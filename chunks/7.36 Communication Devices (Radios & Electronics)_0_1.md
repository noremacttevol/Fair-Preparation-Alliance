- Signal Boosters: In weak signal areas, some have cellular boosters in cars or for home, and radio repeaters (even portable ones like duplexers with two radios) for extending ham/GMRS range during an event.  
- Antennas: Various collapsible antennas (taller whip antennas for handhelds, magnet-mount mobile antennas, roll-up J-pole antennas made of twin-lead for field expedient use) are part of comms kits to improve range substantially when deployed.  
- Accessories: Spare batteries, solar chargers (as noted in power gear), and headsets (earpiece/mic) for radios so communications can be done quietly and hands-free when needed.
With these devices, FPA ensures that each member can stay connected with the team through layers of comm options. Drills include practicing relaying messages through different devices (maybe starting on cell phone, switching to radio, etc.). The communications gear is one of the most vital categories of equipment because it binds the group together in action, so the Alliance spares no effort in procuring and training with these tools.
