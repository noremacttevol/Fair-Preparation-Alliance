During drills, FPA tests how quickly someone can retrieve needed info without internet or power. They simulate, for example, “Find how to treat cholera from our materials” and see if the person finds the answer in printed binders or offline files efficiently. These practices refine how info is packaged and labeled. Ultimately, the goal is that no member is left guessing in a crisis; even if personal electronics fail, the community ensures knowledge is reachable – through shared printouts, communal devices, or good old communication. In essence, FPA designs redundancy not just in comms and gear, but in knowledge delivery, so the right instructions and information reach the right people at the right time, even in dire conditions.
