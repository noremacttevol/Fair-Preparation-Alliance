The transparency logs are basically our **collective memory and conscience**. They ensure we don’t forget mistakes, we give credit where due, and we spot patterns over time. They are also a training resource – new leaders can read past logs to gain wisdom from predecessors. In short, transparency logs turn the abstract principle of transparency into a daily practice that anchors trust.
