- _Contingency Plan:_ If growth stalls (maybe people think “the core team has it covered”), consider doing a high-visibility activity that draws interest. For example, volunteer as a squad in a community fair or parade – being seen in matching vests and helping out can spark conversations with those who never considered joining. If certain demographics remain absent (no young people, for instance), specifically target outreach via channels they use (maybe local high school or college clubs for youth). Sometimes incentives help: could be as simple as providing snacks at meetings or the appeal of learning cool skills. Be cautious to expand at a manageable rate – quality matters. If a sudden influx happens (like after a disaster people are motivated), have a crash orientation ready to plug them in quickly, or else they may drift away once the immediate scare fades.
