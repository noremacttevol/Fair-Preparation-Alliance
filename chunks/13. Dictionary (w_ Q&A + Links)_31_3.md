They envision small, local councils or leadership groups emerging – likely elected or chosen by merit/trust from the survivors. These would be similar to the way FPA chapters run: consensus-driven and accountable to the people they lead. The Trust Doctrine principles would scale up – transparency, fairness, and community consent in decision-making. Rather than one central authority ruling over many, FPA sees a federation of communities, each self-governing with perhaps an alliance compact (like a charter) binding them to mutual defense and trade agreements.
