**(6) Solar Resilience Program**
**What it is:** A comprehensive program to incorporate **solar energy solutions** into our preparedness strategy, enhancing off-grid self-sufficiency for members and FPA operations. This includes installing solar panels and battery backups at key FPA sites (like chapter safehouses and radio relay stations), providing training for members on setting up home solar generators, and even a group-buy initiative to make portable solar chargers and power banks affordable to all members. It’s not just about gear – the program teaches **solar know-how**: how to maintain systems, optimize energy usage during outages, and safely “island” from the grid when needed. In essence, the Solar Resilience Program aims to ensure that when the grid goes down, the lights (and comms) stay on for FPA.
