Q2: What is the mission of FPA and why was it founded?
A: The Fair Preparation Alliance was founded to make prepping more accessible and cooperative. The founders saw that too many people were unprepared or isolated, so they created FPA to bring individuals together and share life-saving knowledge. The mission of FPA is to empower everyday people to handle emergencies through teamwork, education, and a fair approach to resources. Instead of a fear-driven or elitist mindset, FPA promotes mutual trust and ethical preparedness – making sure no willing participant is left behind due to lack of knowledge or means. In essence, FPA’s mission is to build a culture of readiness where members help each other become more resilient, rather than each person fending for themselves. [#Beginner] [#Governance]
