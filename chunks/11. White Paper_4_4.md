- **Lack of Engagement:** Some members might simply drop out or go dormant. The contingency plan is to **reach out and reactivate**. Mentors will check in on quiet members; if someone leaves the program, their mentor can adopt a new mentee to keep capacity up. We also plan periodic Phase1 refresh events – e.g., a “Preparedness Challenge Month” open to all members to re-do a drill or update kits, which can re-engage those who drifted. Ultimately, individuals have freedom – we can’t force participation. But by building a strong peer network (not just top-down direction), we create a sense of belonging that pulls people back in. Transparency also means if someone leaves, others know – maybe a friend in the group gives them a nudge to return. We view dropout not as failure but as a temporary setback to overcome with outreach and adjustments.
