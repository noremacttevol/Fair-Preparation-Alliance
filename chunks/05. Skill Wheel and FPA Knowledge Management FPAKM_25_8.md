- **Avoiding Over-Gamification:** We have been very careful not to turn the Skill Wheel system into a trivial game. Yes, we use game-like visualization and progression, but we stop short of things that could cheapen the seriousness of our mission. For instance, we are not implementing virtual currencies, pointless collectibles, or gimmicky rewards like “buy new avatar clothes with points” – those have no place in a survival preparedness context and would distract from the mission. The _reward_ for leveling up your Skill Wheel is **real competence and the ability to handle crises**, and maybe increased respect and responsibility in the community – not virtual trinkets. This keeps the tone aligned with FPA’s no-nonsense mission. We can certainly have fun during training (friendly competition, badges as mementos, etc.), but everyone knows it’s in service of real-world goals.  
In essence, we strive for what one might call **“authentic gamification”** – using a few game design elements (visual feedback, levels, achievable challenges) purely to drive genuine engagement and skill-building, _never_ to create a false sense of accomplishment. If we ever detect vanity or gaming of the system creeping in, we will recalibrate the system to refocus on reality. Both FPA leadership and the member community will hold each other accountable to keep the Skill Wheel honest and useful.
