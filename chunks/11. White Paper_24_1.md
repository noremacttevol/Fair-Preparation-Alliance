**Lessons Learned:** We realized that some military-like ranks help quickly convey roles, especially when interfacing with officials (who understand what a “Captain” or regional lead implies). But we had to customize it to our volunteer spirit: no saluting or rigid command-and-control. A lesson was to avoid rank inflation – initially we had too many levels for the size, causing confusion. We trimmed it to what made sense (few if any O-7 to O-10 at the start, those ranks mostly empty or honorary until growth warrants). The creation of an **E-10** rank for seasoned field leaders was born from feedback: not everyone wants to sit on a council, some want to keep doing rescues at 60 years old but deserve recognition and a voice. We also learned to tie rank with accountability, not privilege: a higher rank means more duties to the network, and our culture needed to reflect that (avoiding ego trips). Clear documentation in the FPA Dictionary and Compass Guide addendum helped members grasp the new system quickly.
