**6. Culture of Continuous Drilling and Engagement:** Not a technology per se, but a unique trait of our outreach system is that it is _alive_ year-round. Many emergency plans sit on a shelf until needed. FPA’s communications web is continuously active through regular drills, weekly nets (like a weekly radio check-in), newsletters, and community events as described. This constant engagement means our channels are well-oiled. People don’t forget about us in the “down time” because we aim to make preparedness a part of life (without being burdensome). It’s somewhat analogous to volunteer fire departments that have frequent training – the community sees them out there, and when a fire happens, they trust them. Similarly, we run communications exercises that often double as community events, so our presence is known and valued. It’s unique for a preparedness org to integrate with community life to this extent, blurring the line between “the before times” and “disaster times.” We treat every day as potentially the day an emergency could happen, without being paranoid – just staying ready and keeping folks plugged in.
