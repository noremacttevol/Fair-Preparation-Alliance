**Why “Interpreters” Matter:** In a decentralized emergency network, rigid top-down command is neither feasible nor desirable. Situations on the ground evolve quickly, and communications could be cut off. We need people who don’t just await orders but know the _intent_ and _philosophy_ of FPA’s guidance so well that they can make judgment calls consistent with our aims. These are people who can **translate high-level doctrine into specific local action** without needing hand-holding. In essence, they carry the “spirit” of FPA in them. If FPA’s central node went silent, interpreters across communities would continue the mission, improvising as needed but holding to the core values and strategies they’ve learned. This is analogous to how a constitution guides a nation even if some leaders fall away; the citizens know the law of the land and can self-organize to uphold it. We want each prepared community member to be like a constitutional scholar of emergency response, not just a foot-soldier waiting for orders.
