**What’s already implemented (current wins):** The “Test-My-Plan” beta rolled out to a pilot group of 50 members last month. Already, **over 200 plan critiques** have been generated. The wins have been eye-opening: every single pilot user discovered at least one significant oversight in their plan thanks to FPAi. For example, one member learned their home evacuation route was likely to be flooded and blocked in a severe storm scenario – a detail uncovered by the AI’s cross-check of floodplain maps (they’ve since added an alternate route). Another user found that while they had plenty of food, they’d overlooked water needs for sanitation; the AI pointed out a **water storage gap** relative to family size. Importantly, the tone of the critiques has been tuned to be **helpful, not alarming** – users report feeling guided rather than judged by the AI’s suggestions. We’ve also integrated an _“Ask FPAi”_ feature where members can query the AI for clarifications (e.g., “Why did you suggest I need more water?” and it will cite the guideline of one gallon per person per day ([Build A Kit | Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/kit#:~:text=After%20an%20emergency%2C%20you%20may,the%20event%20of%20an%20emergency))). The AI engine is learning from each plan it analyzes, which means the more it’s used, the smarter and more contextual its feedback becomes for our community.
