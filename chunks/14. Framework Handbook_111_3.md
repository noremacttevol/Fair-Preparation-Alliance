- **Points System:** FPA has an internal points currency that works alongside money. Members earn points by contributing time (volunteering at events, teaching a skill), donating gear, or paying above-cost if they’re Supporters. They spend points to get gear, training, or extra help. It’s a bit of a mutual credit system. During an emergency, if external money is useless (ATMs down, etc.), we can temporarily run purely on points/barter among members. Dynamic pricing in that scenario might mean adjusting point costs so supplies go where needed most but with an IOU system to keep it fair (for instance, we note that one squad took extra fuel from the cache, using up points; later when fuel is restocked, those who didn’t get any might get priority or bonus points). The **goal is not to micromanage with bureaucracy, but to prevent panic buying and ensure equitable distribution**. Our points and pricing are tools to reinforce the Trust Doctrine in practical terms.  
- **Marketplace & Barter:** The app also has a section for peer-to-peer exchange. If a member has spare gear they want to sell or trade, they can list it. We encourage fair pricing there too (and users often use the points system). For example, someone might trade a spare tent for 50 points, which they can then use to “buy” something else from someone. This internal economy strengthens self-sufficiency and keeps resources circulating within the community rather than everyone buying new.
