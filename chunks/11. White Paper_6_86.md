- Keep these documents accessible: a binder at HQ, and/or in a shared online folder (for as long as internet is available). Also, perhaps put key action checklists on laminated cards for quick reference (laminate a card that says “House Fire Response Steps” and put in go-bags, etc.).  
- After any exercise or incident, hold a brief post-mortem and update the documentation. For example, “We realized our phone tree was outdated; updated contact list attached. Also added protocol that if no response from a person after 3 attempts, send a runner.” By Version 3 or 4, you’ll have a pretty robust SOP.  
- Cross-reference entries to FPA Dictionary or Compass Guide entries where relevant. E.g., if you write “We follow ICS principles for command,” footnote it like “(see **ICS** in FPA Dictionary for definitions of roles).” This helps ensure consistency with wider standards and helps any outside reader or successor understand context.
