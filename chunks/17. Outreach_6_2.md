- **Social Media vs. Owned Channels:** We leverage social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.) to meet people where they are, but we always funnel interested individuals to **deeper engagement channels** that we control, such as our email newsletter, Signal/Telegram preparedness groups, or the FPA community forum. This way, if an algorithm changes or the internet is temporarily inaccessible, we still have a direct line (email and SMS, for instance, can still function in partial outages and can be exported as contact lists for other uses). Our messaging on social media uses the tone described above â€“ for instance, a Twitter thread might tell a mini-story of how a prepared community handled a recent flood better than an unprepared one, highlighting our principles in action. We actively avoid toxic or divisive online discussions; our voice stays above the fray, focusing on solutions and unity.
