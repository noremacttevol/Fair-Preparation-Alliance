not stealing from fellow survivors). If doing any scavenging, they do it systematically and carefully (buddy teams go out with communication, areas are assigned to avoid duplication, and OPSEC is maintained to not advertise what they gathered). The logistics team prioritizes needed items – e.g., water and medical supplies first, then fuel, etc. Fair Distribution: True to “fair preparation,” the Alliance has an understanding that resources will be shared so everyone meets basic needs.

If someone contributed less before, they aren’t left to die, though afterwards things might be evened out in work or replacement. This fairness is discussed beforehand to prevent conflict during crises.
