**Solar, DC-to-DC Power: Off-Grid Energy Immune to EMP:** Traditional power infrastructure will be one of the first casualties of an EMP. Every member and squad must have off-grid power that can function in a blackout: primarily **solar photovoltaic panels, charge controllers, and battery storage**. But it’s not enough to have a solar generator – it must be configured for resilience. Wherever possible, use **DC-to-DC** power setups to reduce dependence on sensitive inverters. Most of our critical comms gear (radios, LED lights, tablets, certain appliances) can run on low-voltage DC power. In fact, virtually all ham radio transceivers are designed to run on ~12 volts DC (standard vehicle battery voltage) ([katrina_hamradio](https://mst.rice.edu/PHYS501/SPR2007Papers/Nkung_kat.pdf#:~:text=morse%20code%2C%20can%20be%20extremely,This%20point%20is%20not%20accidental)). This is by design: a radio can be powered directly from a car battery or solar-charged deep-cycle battery without an AC grid. We leverage that feature. Each squad should have a **solar charging kit** that includes panels, a battery (or supercapacitor bank), and DC adapters for their devices. By using DC-to-DC converters (for example, a 12V to 5V USB adapter, or 12V to regulated 9V for certain devices), we avoid the inefficiency and fragility of AC inverters. Fewer complex electronics in the system means fewer failure points under EMP. A basic setup could be: a 100W folding solar panel feeding a charge controller,
