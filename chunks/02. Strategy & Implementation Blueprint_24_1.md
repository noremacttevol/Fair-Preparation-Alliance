- **Security with Privacy:** Trust also means members feel their rights are respected. While we are transparent about operations, we also protect personal privacy (e.g., personal data not relevant to the group’s functioning remains private). The Trust Doctrine outlines that surveillance is not a tactic we use internally; any data we collect is with consent and for the purpose of safety and coordination, never for personal gain or control. Security measures are implemented to guard member data, and any breach or misuse of data is itself a violation of trust that is treated seriously.  
- **Meritocracy and Fairness:** Positions of responsibility are earned through the progression system, and decisions (like resource allocation or policy changes) are made based on merit and need, not favoritism. The Trust Doctrine demands impartiality – we strive to avoid biases and if any are discovered (say an AI algorithm inadvertently favoring certain members’ input over others), we correct them. Fairness extends to conflict resolution: everyone gets to voice concerns and have them addressed through proper channels.
