C. Leadership Accountability and Checks  
Leadership in FPA is not a privilege to be guarded, but a responsibility under oversight. To guard against leadership failure or abuse:  
Role of the Board/Movement Council: If FPA has a Board of Directors or equivalent top oversight group (depending on structure), that body ensures leadership adheres to this framework. They periodically review whether leadership (circles and movement level) is handling conflicts appropriately. If there are signs of cover-ups or patterns of complaints about a particular leader, the Board will investigate. They also maintain a succession plan – meaning if a key leader has to step down due to conflict or misconduct, the Alliance isn’t thrown into chaos. Knowing that there is oversight helps leaders remember they too are accountable.  
Democratic or Consent-based Leadership Selection: FPA might incorporate member input in choosing leaders (through elections or consent processes). Leaders who are accountable to members will be more mindful of their actions. Moreover, terms or periodic reconfirmation can avoid entrenched power – e.g., a circle lead must be reaffirmed annually by their circle. If they’ve caused many conflicts or lost trust, the circle can decide to rotate someone else in. This built-in renewal prevents the scenario of a toxic leader remaining indefinitely and the conflict system being powerless against them.
