- Invite CERT instructors to FPA regional gatherings to give talks or run drills. Likewise, offer FPA experts (like a HAM lead or wilderness medic) to present at CERT events, raising FPA’s profile.  
- Document FPA member participation in CERT (maybe a checkbox in the squad registry for who’s CERT-certified) so we know our internal capability and can leverage those folks as instructors within FPA too.  
- Use CERT’s existing evaluation drills as a low-cost way to gauge squad readiness – basically piggyback on their simulations rather than always staging our own, saving resources.
