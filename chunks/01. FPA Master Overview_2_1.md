- **Squad Formation (Ground-Level Units):** We organize members into squads (small, tight-knit teams) right from the start. A typical squad might be **8-12 members** who live in proximity, with an elected squad leader. This **squad logic** ensures that even at the smallest unit level, there’s leadership and accountability. Squads train together, maintain local caches of supplies, and form the first line of mutual aid in an emergency. Everyone knows their squad mates by name – these are the people who will have your back when things go wrong.  
- **Communications Backbone:** During Phase1 we establish robust low-tech comms. The Alliance designates **7.200MHz** as our **pulse frequency** on the HAM bands – a calling and coordination channel for FPA operators. At scheduled times (for example, a brief roll-call transmission every evening), members broadcast a “pulse” – a short status update or even just an acknowledgment signal – on 7.200MHz. This habit forms a reliable heartbeat for the Alliance: even if phones and internet fail, anyone with a shortwave radio can tune in to **hear our presence and coordinate**. Other communications include CB channels and offline messengers – whatever it takes to stay linked.
