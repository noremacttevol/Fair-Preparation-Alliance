shared document) that alerts when certain stored items need refreshing (e.g., rotate water storage every 6 months). If the group has a garden or livestock in a friendly member’s care, others pitch in labor in exchange for share of produce, thereby integrating ongoing resource generation. Logistics in Crisis (Phase 2): When an emergency hits, FPA has a logistics plan ready. For example, they know which vehicles are available and who will drive them (if evacuating, one member with a truck might do multiple trips to help move others’ families or gear, following the plan). They set rally points that allow for load consolidation – at a rally, members pool what they brought to ensure an even distribution. Perhaps family A’s house burned so they lost supplies; the group will allocate extra from others so that family still has food and water. Supplies are then managed collectively to some degree – the group might designate a “quartermaster” role to track group inventory and ration if needed. Resupply and Scavenging: FPA also plans for acquiring resources post-event. Members skilled in hunting, fishing, foraging or gardening will take lead on those tasks, while others maybe secure fuel from safe, non-intrusive sources (like siphoning from abandoned equipment, but always ethically – e.g., not stealing from fellow survivors). If doing any scavenging, they do it systematically and carefully (buddy teams go out with communication, areas are assigned to avoid duplication, and OPSEC is
