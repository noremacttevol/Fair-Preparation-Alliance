**Cultural Movement, Not Fan Base:** We instill in our community that being in FPA is joining a movement, not subscribing to a channel. The difference is engagement. We expect participation, feedback, and co-creation. Our communications frequently call on people to do something tangible (share with 3 friends, lead a family prep night, write in with your ideas, etc.). By giving people roles and expecting growth, we naturally filter in those who will become standard-bearers. The “fan base” approach – just having millions of passive followers – might boost numbers but won’t save lives when networks are down. A smaller number of true interpreters distributed in each community is far superior. They are our _force multipliers_. If each interpreter trains 10 more people around them in core skills, and those in turn train others, we get an exponential spread of capability (much like the concept of **Train the Trainer** programs).
