- After drill, gather immediately for debrief. Discuss what went well and what failed. Perhaps one person couldn’t hear on the radio, or people forgot steps. Capture these on paper. This is a **no-blame, learning** discussion – every mistake is a gift for improvement.  
- Update your plans and training based on the findings. If the flashlight issue happened, now “check batteries monthly” gets added to someone’s duties. If comms were chaotic, maybe implement simple radio codes or discipline. Plan the next drill addressing some of these improvements to see progress.  
- _Contingency Plan:_ If turnout for the drill is low (only a few members available), scale the scenario down but proceed – even a partial team drill is useful. If someone panics or there is confusion, pause, explain, then continue – it’s a **learning environment**. Avoid extremely high-stress or dangerous simulations; keep it safe. If you lack realism (maybe no props or actors), just talking through steps while physically walking the area is still valuable (“tabletop exercise”). Document the lessons in a shared log (transparency ensures even absent members learn from it). Ensure no one’s pride is hurt by mistakes – frame everything as collective improvement, not individual failure.
