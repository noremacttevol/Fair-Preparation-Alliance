The top layer (though in practice it underpins everything) is the **physical and infrastructure layer**. FPA equips its members and squads with tools and systems that provide **redundancy and resilience** in hardware and infrastructure:  
- **Communications Equipment:** Every squad is encouraged to have multiple communication tools. This includes standard smartphones with the FPA app, but also radios (e.g. HAM or FM transceivers), satellite communicators for remote areas, and even signal tools like whistles or flares for worst-case scenarios. The idea is to have a communication **Plan A, B, C** (e.g., internet messaging as primary, radio as secondary, in-person runners as tertiary). We maintain a **comms SOP** that defines which channels to try in sequence if others fail. Squads practice switching to backups during drills.  
- **Power and Energy:** To support an offline-first operation, power independence is vital. Squads maintain **SHTF power kits** such as solar chargers, battery banks, hand-crank generators, or small fuel generators where appropriate. The infrastructure plan assumes grid power may be unavailable, so critical devices (phones, radios, medical devices) must be rechargeable off-grid. We vet and recommend reliable models of power banks and solar panels (part of our **gear vetting** program, see below). Additionally, important facilities like any FPA base camps or data relay points have backup generators and fuel stock.
