**Description:** Create a framework for international communications among FPA chapters: common HAM radio HF frequencies for long-distance links, time-coordinated global radio check-ins, and shared Outernet content streams for worldwide alerts. This ensures that even across continents, FPA teams can reach each other and share critical information.
**Real-World Example:** By 2028, FPA’s Global Net schedule was in place – every Sunday GMT, ham operators from different countries checked in on a designated 14.300 MHz frequency. During a Pacific earthquake, an FPA operator in Japan relayed damage reports over HF radio that were picked up in California and forwarded to other chapters, providing early situational awareness globally.
**Lessons Learned:** We discovered propagation and language barriers needed addressing – some regions couldn’t reliably reach others via HF at certain hours, so we added alternate freqs and relays. Also, having basic English language protocols helped, but we learned to incorporate translation help (like bilingual operators or simple codes) so no group is left out due to language.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Assign specific HF frequencies (and backup frequencies) for FPA international use on popular ham bands (20m, 40m), and publish this in all chapters’ comm plans.  
- Coordinate a global communications schedule (e.g., weekly nets) and practice cross-border message relays during these nets to build familiarity.
