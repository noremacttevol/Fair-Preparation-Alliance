**Links to FPA Resources:** The **Squad Hub** is accessible via the FPA App (“Teams” section). The **Team Formation & Merge SOP** (to be published) codifies the merge-logic criteria and approval process. We drew inspiration from Incident Command System (ICS) principles – see Compass Guide’s _“Modular Response Structure”_ section for the philosophy【CompassGuide】. Also, our **Trust Graph** data (Innovation 11) is being integrated to ensure merges respect interpersonal trust levels. Check the **Dictionary** for definitions of squad roles like “Squad Leader,” “Deputy,” etc., which the Squad Tools use for permissions【Dictionary】. This all upholds the Trust Doctrine idea that _effective organization increases trust and success_, by making sure squads are neither isolated nor overburdened【TrustDoctrine】.
