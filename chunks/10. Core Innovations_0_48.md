**(10) Squad Tools & Merge-Logic**
**What it is:** A set of digital and organizational **tools to support squads** (our small teams of members) and an intelligent “merge-logic” system that suggests optimal merging or restructuring of squads for strength. The Squad Tools include a squad management app interface where members can share calendars, tasks, and resource inventories with their team, and emergency activation features (like a one-tap “SOS to squad” alert). The **Merge-Logic** is an algorithm (used by leadership or region coordinators) that analyzes squad composition, geography, and activity levels to recommend when two squads should merge into one or when a large squad should split. It considers factors like skill diversity (from the Skill Wheel data), headcount, and proximity. Essentially, these innovations ensure that our fundamental operating units – squads – are **well-equipped and appropriately structured** as conditions change.
