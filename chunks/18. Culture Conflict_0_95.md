Learning and Adaptation = Relevance Maintained: Through continuous learning and adaptation (Section V.C), FPA avoids stagnation. Many organizations fragment because part of the group feels the organization is no longer effective or true to its mission, so they start a new one. We prevent that by regularly updating our practices and even mission interpretation through collective reflection. If some members feel weâ€™re off-course, we have mechanisms for the movement to self-correct with them, rather than them feeling they must break off. In effect, the Alliance can evolve to incorporate valid critiques, keeping the whole group together through changing circumstances. This adaptability means that 50 years from now, FPA may look different in operation but will still be one Alliance, having transformed rather than shattered under pressure.
