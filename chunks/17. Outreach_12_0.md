To our early builders, top contributors, and squad founders reading this: understand that what you are constructing is nothing less than the communications backbone of a new, decentralized **emergency republic**. This term may sound grandiose, but it captures the vision: a republic is a form of self-government by the people, and in our context, it’s the people self-governing their preparedness and disaster response, rather than relying solely on external authorities. The strategy laid out in this document is akin to the constitutional framework for that republic – and _you_ are the framers.
