- _Contingency Plan:_ If actual satellite gear is out of reach due to cost or complexity, implement “poor man’s Outernet”: maintain an **offline knowledge library** on a laptop or printed binder. Download key PDFs (first aid manuals, crop planting guides, etc.) when you have internet and save them offline. Even an old smartphone with a downloaded set of pages can be a mini-library in a pinch. For weather, consider radio data like NOAA weather radio – inexpensive receivers can get forecasts that you then share manually. As Outernet constellations like Rivada come online by 2026-27 with likely wider coverage, revisit funding – there may be grants available for community nodes (the question prompt explicitly hints squads should target grant programs for Outernet by 2026). Be prepared to justify the cost by showing how many people it will serve with critical information during crises.
