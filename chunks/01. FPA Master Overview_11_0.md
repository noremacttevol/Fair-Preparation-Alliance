The **Governance & Oversight** content family is the conscience and guardrail of the Fair Preparation Alliance. While other teams execute operations, build tools, and train members, Governance & Oversight ensures that everything we do stays true to our values, is legally and ethically sound, and that power is exercised fairly. This content family deals with structure, rules, ethics, dispute resolution, and financial oversight. They make sure the “Fair” in Fair Preparation Alliance is not just a tagline, but a daily practice. Here’s how they function in detail:  
- **Alliance Charter & Policies:** Governance is responsible for drafting and updating the **Alliance’s Charter, Bylaws, and Policies**. This is essentially our constitution. It outlines how decisions are made, how leaders are chosen, the rights and responsibilities of members, and the code of conduct. For instance, the dynamic pricing model’s rules (when to cap, how to vote to zero, etc.) are codified by this team. They also establish **membership standards**: e.g., zero tolerance policies for theft, violence against innocents, or any form of discrimination within our ranks. They regularly review these governing documents, especially after major phases or incidents, to see if rules need adjustment. They’ll often consult the membership for input on big changes (we’re participatory), then finalize and enforce.
