- **Unachievable Perfection:** The decision that 100% is unreachable is in part to prevent the “game over, I won” mentality. In many games or gamified systems, once people hit the max level or collect all badges, they lose interest or get overly proud. By always leaving room for improvement, even top performers stay engaged and humble. It also encourages knowledge-sharing: if someone has an impressively filled-out wheel, one of the only ways for them to keep growing is to **mentor others** (teaching is a great way to deepen one’s own understanding). We’ll encourage this – essentially saying, “If your wheel is nearly full, your new goal is to help someone else fill theirs.” It transforms high achievers from being end-of-line “winners” into valuable coaches and force-multipliers.
