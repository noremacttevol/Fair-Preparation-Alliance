- **Anchoring in Core Principles:** While we evolve details, certain foundational things _should not_ change lightly. Our trust-over-control philosophy, our civic resilience mission, our commitment to transparency – these are bedrock. If any proposed change ever seems to violate those, that’s a red flag. In fact, the **Trust Firewall** concept applies metaphorically to governance changes too: if someone proposed “let’s give one person permanent supreme authority in emergencies,” the cultural firewall (and likely many vocal members) would reject that as against everything we stand for. We bake our values so deeply into our culture that it would be very hard for a malicious actor to steer us away from them without everyone noticing. In practice, our AI co-pilot (under oversight) might even be used to scan proposed amendments for keywords or patterns that hint at centralization of power or other unwanted shifts – another example of human values guiding tech to help protect human values. (This is a case where our [[AI Reliability & Human Oversight]] tools can assist by flagging anything that looks like a betrayal of trust or transparency.) We intend to use every defense we have – cultural, procedural, and technological – to keep the alliance anchored to its core principles.
