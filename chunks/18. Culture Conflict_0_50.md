By having these escalation pathways, FPA ensures that no conflict slips through the cracks or festers just because it crosses team boundaries. There is always a “next step” available if needed, up to the highest levels of authority. This multi-tier approach hardens us against fragmentation: rather than splintering off in separate ways when disagreement arises, we have a built-in path to confront and reconcile differences under the umbrella of our shared Alliance.  
Process 3: Movement-Level Critique & Collective Reflection  
Not all conflicts are narrow disputes; sometimes, tension is diffuse or many members feel discontent about something in the movement’s culture or direction. Additionally, even when we resolve individual conflicts, it’s important to reflect on them collectively to learn and improve. Thus, FPA has institutionalized processes for movement-wide critique and reflection. Think of this as the Alliance taking its own pulse and holding up a mirror to itself, ensuring we course-correct and evolve through the years. This is less about resolving a specific “Case #123” and more about ongoing resilience-building.
