**Scalability:** Squads are the building blocks of the larger FPA network. In a major event, multiple squads can coordinate for broader coverage. Because all squads follow the same structure and terminology in Mk1Mod3, any two squads can collaborate easily â€“ a member from Squad A can slot into Squad B temporarily if needed, with minimal confusion about who does what. This interoperability is much improved from Mk1Mod2, when group structures varied.
