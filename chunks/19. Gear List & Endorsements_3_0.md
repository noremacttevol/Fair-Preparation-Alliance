To put our principles into action, the FPA follows a rigorous multi-phase process for every piece of gear before and after it earns an FPA endorsement. This **gear lifecycle**—from discovery to potential de-listing—is designed to be thorough, transparent, and member-powered. Below are the phases of the process, each with its purpose and an example of how it works in practice:  
1. **Tip Drop (Gear Discovery):** It all begins when a member drops a tip about a piece of gear. This could be a new water filter someone heard about, a reliable old tool not widely known, or a popular gadget gaining buzz online. The tip is logged in our system (with date, source, and who submitted it). _For example, a member might post: “I found a new solar charger called PowerMaxX being advertised as a ‘must-have’ – has anyone tested it?”_ The tip-off alerts the Alliance that this item merits investigation. **Rationale:** By crowdsourcing leads from members on the ground, we stay ahead of marketing hype and focus on gear that real preppers are curious or concerned about. No single source of information is ignored—if it matters to our members, we take note.
