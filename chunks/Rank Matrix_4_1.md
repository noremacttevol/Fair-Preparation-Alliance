- **E-7 (Leader):** Step into a leadership role on a small scale. At E-7, you **plan and lead a team drill** under challenging conditions. For example, you might organize a neighborhood emergency response exercise or lead your local FPA squad in a night-time communications drill. You’ll be responsible for coordinating the participants, running the scenario (such as a simulated storm or evacuation), and debriefing lessons learned. Successfully running this drill – with peers attesting to your effective leadership – earns you the Leader rank. _(AP: points for drill leadership, scenario planning, and after-action reporting.)_  
- **E-8 (Mentor):** Begin formally **mentoring others and sharing your expertise.** At this rank, you take on at least one junior member (or a small group) and coach them through their early ranks – helping them improve their emergency plans, giving them tips to pass their tests, and validating their progress. You also **vet others’ preparedness plans** as a peer reviewer, providing constructive feedback and helping to improve those plans. This develops your teaching skills and strengthens the whole group. _(AP: points for each member mentored or plan reviewed; this also builds peer respect which is crucial for validation.)_
