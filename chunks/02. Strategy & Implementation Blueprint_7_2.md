- **Multi-tools and repair kits** to fix gear on the fly.  
- **Water purification**, food rations, and shelter basics for survival situations.  
- **Protective equipment** (from basic things like gloves and flashlights to specialized gear like respirators or ropes, depending on context).  
- **Cash reserves** or trade goods if electronic transactions fail.  
- Basically, the SHTF stack covers **basic needs (water, food, shelter, safety, comms)** with robust, non-electronic solutions.  
- **Gear Vetting Program:** FPA runs a **gear vetting** process to test and approve items that go into our recommended kits (from the high-tech to the low-tech). Experienced members and experts review gear for durability, ease of use, battery life, etc. For example, before endorsing a particular hand-crank radio or water filter, we field-test it under stress and multiple conditions. Results of these tests are shared in the transparency logs and the Compass Guide (so everyone knows why we chose one model over another). This not only steers members toward reliable equipment, but it also builds trust that we arenâ€™t just taking manufacturer claims at face value. Members are encouraged to report their own experiences with gear, contributing to collective knowledge.
