_Phase 1_ establishes the core [[Application System]] and onboarding flow on a small scale, prioritizing **manual acceptance** and **offline-first** design. This ensures early users are vetted by humans and can function without full reliance on cloud services.  
- **Minimal Application Form:** To reduce friction and accelerate launch, the initial application collects only essential info: **Callsign/Team Name, Email, and ZIP Code** ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=%2A%2Akey%20changes:%2A%2A%20,name,%20email,%20and%20zip%20code/)). This “2-minute application” omits complex questions in the MVP. (E.g. _“Just your name, ZIP, an optional sentence on why you’re here, and a quick gear tip you’ve tried.”_ ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=fill%20out%20a%202,a%20flashlight%20in%20the%20woods-nj51d/))) Keeping it simple encourages sign-ups while deferring detailed vetting to later phases.
