- **National Oversight & Evolution:** At this stage, the **national leadership and platform team step back** from day-to-day user management and focus on big-picture maintenance:  
- The **membership fee** likely enters Phase 3’s endgame: once 100k members are reached, the fee may drop to ~$1 or trigger a vote to eliminate fees altogether ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=%20phase%203:%20sunset%20phase,%20100,000%20members-jt15dd2535q/)). The platform shifts to being funded by sponsors or other streams (as decided by community vote). The **audit feed** keeps everyone informed of finances and any sponsorships, preserving trust ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=%20section%20iv:%20governance%20&,the%20fpa%20live%20audit%20feed-1l001i/)).  
- **Platform Governance** becomes democratic. Major changes to the app or rules might be put to member vote (using the app’s polling feature with transparency). The ethos is that with a large, invested membership, FPA can self-govern (with its Constitution/Bylaws, likely established earlier, guiding the process).
