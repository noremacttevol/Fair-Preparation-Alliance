The following core principles guide the FPA’s gear endorsement system and are the pillars of this doctrine:  
- **Truth & Transparency:** All gear evaluations are evidence-based. Claims must be verified by member testing and honest reporting. Nothing is taken at face value from advertisements. The entire process, from test results to vendor communications, is documented and open to member review.  
- **Fairness & Affordability:** We seek to drive fairness into the supply chain by championing reasonably priced, high-quality tools over overpriced “hype” products. If an item’s cost is inflated due to marketing rather than merit, we expose that and favor alternatives or negotiate better pricing. Ethical bulk-buy deals and pricing transparency are used to make vital gear affordable for members **without compromising on quality**.  
- **Resilience & Off-Grid Readiness:** Gear endorsed by the FPA must be **field-tested** under real conditions and be off-grid capable. This means it can operate without external power or support (or with minimal, easily renewable power) and withstand harsh conditions. Every endorsed item should earn its place in a crisis scenario as outlined in the FPA’s _SHTF Bible_ of emergency scenarios. If a tool can’t perform when “stuff hits the fan,” it doesn’t get our endorsement.
