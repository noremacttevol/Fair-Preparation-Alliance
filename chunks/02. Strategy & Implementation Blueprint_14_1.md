- **Edge/Peer Servers:** As mentioned, in a local community or during a large operation, we may deploy an edge server. Technically, this is a node that hosts a shared database and maybe a more powerful AI model on something like a laptop or special device. It syncs with clients nearby and with the cloud when possible. Think of it as a mini-cloud that can drop into a disaster zone along with relief teams, or a permanent local hub for a remote village of FPA members. These edge servers are part of the stack to increase reliability.  
- **Central Servers (Cloud):** FPA maintains secure central servers that aggregate data (like the transparency logs, global announcements, software updates, etc.). They also host the heavy AI systems that require more compute (for example, if a member requests a very complex plan simulation or large-scale data analysis, the request can be sent to the cloud AI when connectivity allows). The central servers also facilitate inter-region communication and serve as backup storage for all the local data (with encryption). Importantly, the central infrastructure is kept minimal and federated: we avoid one giant monolith server. Instead, there may be several redundant servers in different geographies. Each one can operate independently if others fail. They sync over time (similar to how distributed ledger nodes might).
