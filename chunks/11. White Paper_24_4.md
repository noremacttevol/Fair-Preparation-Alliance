**Contingency Plan:** If there’s pushback internally (some members may bristle at any semblance of hierarchy), reinforce that this structure is about coordination, not control. We can make it flexible – e.g., allow squads to elect their leaders who then get an O-ranking, rather than having them “appointed” from above. If the structure proves too granular, we can compress it (we might not need all 10 officer ranks immediately – that’s fine, we can leave some unused without issue). Conversely, if key leadership roles are vacant (no volunteer for a certain region lead), the rank exists but is simply unfilled until someone steps up – another region’s officer can cover interim with dual-hatting. The E-10 concept should be handled carefully: it’s meant to honor and include expert volunteers, but if it causes confusion or elitism, we’d scrap it or rename it. We’ll monitor feedback closely; the rank system is a tool we control, not something that controls us. If it doesn’t serve the mission, we adjust or dismantle it – the ultimate authority is the Trust Doctrine and the needs of the alliance, not stripes on a sleeve.
