In sum, FPA does strive to be a force for good in its community, not just a secretive clique. Members are reminded that maintaining humanity is part of what they’re fighting for. However, they also acknowledge that if they give away everything or expose themselves recklessly, they can’t help anyone in the long run. Thus, they walk a careful line: help where you can, but secure your oxygen mask first. This approach often earns FPA quiet respect from those who receive their aid, even if they never learn the full story of the Alliance. (Cross-ref: [[Public Image and Perception Management]] – responsible aid can improve public perception of preppers in general, and [[Legal and Ethical Compliance]] – FPA ensures any aid given doesn’t break laws or moral codes, e.g., they won’t resort to violence to aid outsiders unless absolutely necessary for defense.)
