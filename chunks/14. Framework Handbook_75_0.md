In Mk1Mod2, members had varied levels of readiness with no clear way to measure or motivate improvement. Some folks joined and gathered a few supplies but never progressed to learning more advanced skills. Others trained intensely, but their expertise wasn’t formally recognized or shared. Mk1Mod3’s ORP addresses this by:  
- **Defining clear levels** of operational readiness, so members can self-assess and aspire to reach higher competency.  
- **Encouraging training and participation** through recognition – hitting a new level is an achievement celebrated within the community.  
- **Ensuring standardization**: each level has certain training and capability benchmarks, aligning everyone on core competencies (much like belts in martial arts or ranks in Scouting).  
- **Identifying leaders and trainers**: higher-level members can be tapped to take on leadership, mentor newer members, or handle specialized tasks.  
The ORP is not about creating a rigid hierarchy or competition; it’s about personal growth and ensuring that, in a crisis, as many people as possible have the skills and experience to act effectively.
