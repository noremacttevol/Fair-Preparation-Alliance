1. **Culture firstâ†’ Governance second.** [[Trust Doctrine]] underpins every other system; breaches invoke [[Trust Escalation Chain]].  
2. **Governance feeds Planning.** ORP levels reference Rank permissions; only a Level3 can lead a [[Compass SOP]] drafting team.  
3. **Planning drives Operations.** Every live mission follows a Compass SOP and is executed by a [[Squad Framework]] unit.  
4. **Operations generate Data.** Squads log events into the [[FPAApp]]; the [[Dynamic Loop Engine]] crunches that data nightly.  
5. **Data improves Knowledge.** Lessons become SHTF Bible addenda, closing the loop.
