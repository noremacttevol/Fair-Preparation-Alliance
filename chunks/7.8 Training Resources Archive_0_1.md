Vault, e.g., a note on “Fire Safety” might link to a training slideshow in the archive. Many resources are kept in both digital form (for quick sharing, perhaps on the group cloud drive) and hard copy in chapter binders. Additionally, FPA often sources military field manuals and similar documents (many are public domain) which provide rigorous training info – these are archived and annotated for civilian context. By having a robust training archive, FPA keeps its educational momentum high: trainers have tools at their fingertips, trainees have supplementary material, and the collective skill level can continuously rise, with the archive acting as the memory of all training conducted.
