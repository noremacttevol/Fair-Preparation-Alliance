Cache supplies typically mirror core needs: a cache might have a few days of food and water, batteries, a change of clothes, basic first aid, and copies of important info – enough to sustain someone who lost everything or to resupply a group on the move. FPA plans them such that if a group must flee with only what’s on their back, hitting a cache en route can dramatically improve their situation. They keep an inventory of caches in the knowledge vault (securely). Maintenance runs are scheduled to refresh water and rotate food. The gear strategy here is redundancy and insurance: if one cache is compromised, others still exist. Members are made aware of caches relevant to likely bug-out paths, and contingency plans exist if a cache retrieval fails. By caching supplies, FPA extends its logistical reach and resilience, making sure that even if primary stores are lost or inaccessible, not all is gone – proverbial “eggs” are in many baskets.
