**Small Teams, Big Benefits:** A squad is typically 5 to 12 people – small enough to remain agile and close-knit, but big enough to pool a diverse set of skills. In a crisis, a well-organized squad can tackle tasks that would overwhelm a single person (clearing debris, conducting a search, purifying large amounts of water, etc.). Each member contributes in their area of strength while trusting others to cover different needs. This division of labor and mutual support multiplies overall effectiveness.  
**Redundancy and Coverage:** With multiple people, squads provide redundancy. If one member is injured or unavailable, others can step up. Key roles are at least two-deep (for instance, at least two people know how to handle the radio, two are proficient in first aid, etc.). This ensures critical capabilities aren’t lost with one person out of action.  
**Morale and Motivation:** There’s also a psychological edge – facing disasters as a team is less daunting than going it alone. Squad members motivate each other to maintain their gear and training (no one wants to be the only one out of shape or missing a working flashlight when an emergency strikes). This gentle peer pressure keeps preparedness from falling by the wayside in normal times.
