Q12: What’s the difference between a “prepper” and a “survivalist”?
A: The terms overlap a lot, but there are some connotations that set them apart. A prepper is someone who actively prepares for emergencies or disruptions (stockpiling food, water, supplies, making plans). It’s a broad modern term – preppers can be everyday people in cities or suburbs building readiness for anything from hurricanes to economic trouble. A survivalist is an older term that often implies a more hardcore approach: someone very focused on self-sufficiency and wilderness survival skills, possibly expecting society to collapse. Survivalists are often portrayed as lone wolves living off the land with guns and bushcraft knowledge. In practice, many people use the words interchangeably now. But generally, “prepper” is a more inclusive term (covering practical disaster preparedness), while “survivalist” hints at an extreme, live-off-the-land scenario. [#Beginner] [#Terminology]
