**Actionable Steps:**  
- Plan summits biennially, rotating host countries if possible to spread the travel burden and showcase different disaster contexts.  
- Secure funding via donations, partner NGOs, or modest attendee fees to cover venue and travel scholarships for volunteers from low-income regions.  
- Create a summit agenda that balances hands-on training (multi-national drills, skill workshops) with strategic discussions (like refining global protocols).  
- Encourage open sharing: publish all presentations and training materials online (and via Outernet) for the benefit of those not present, and archive them as part of FPA’s global knowledge base.  
- Involve external experts (from academia, agencies) for fresh insights, but keep the tone practical and peer-to-peer – this isn’t a lecture circuit, it’s doers teaching doers.
