This redundancy of leadership and skills ensures resilience. Ultimately, FPA’s goal is that no single point of failure – including a person – can derail the Alliance’s functioning. If one leader falls, another picks up the flag, so to speak. This gives members confidence that the group will remain organized even in worst-case scenarios. It’s often stressed: “The plan leads, not just the person,” meaning the Alliance’s prepared framework (the Mark I Mod III plan) guides everyone, with or without the usual leaders present. (Cross-reference: [[Strategic Plan Overview (3-Phase Approach)]] which outlines broad actions any group can take if cut off, and [[Coordination Structure and Chain of Command]] for how alternate command is structured.)
