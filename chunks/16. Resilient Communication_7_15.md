**Certification and Records:** The Alliance keeps records of who has completed which training and exercises. This way, in an emergency, we know who’s qualified to fill what role. For instance, if a regional comms leader is taken out, we can quickly identify another Phase 3 or 4 in a neighboring area to assume net control. Members carry an **Alliance ID (offline and secure) or have a known code** that includes their ORP phase and key skills (like a shorthand on a wallet card or dog tag). This is part of resilience – even if someone comes to help from a different chapter, you can quickly gauge their comms ability by their credential and plug them in appropriately.  
**Regular Drills and Refreshers:** The Alliance schedules regular communication exercises that involve all phases. For example, quarterly “Blackout Day” drills where every member is expected to simulate a total communications outage and use alternative methods to check in. Phase 1 folks might simply turn on an emergency radio and listen for a broadcast from leadership. Phase 2 and 3 will actively communicate and relay, and Phase 4 will simulate strategic decisions. These drills are evaluated, sometimes graded, and feedback is given to individuals and teams. If someone struggles, they might be asked to retrain on certain tasks or even temporarily drop a phase until competence is regained – because in real crises we can’t afford unqualified people in roles.
