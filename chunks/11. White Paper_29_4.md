- Codify the neutrality and independence clauses strongly now that Phase 3 is mature: e.g., an amendment that FPA shall remain non-partisan and not under government control, which can only be overturned by an overwhelming supermajority, if at all. Lock in those hard-won principles so theyâ€™re not easily eroded in the future.  
- Archive old versions of our Charter/Doctrine publicly (within FPA) to maintain transparency about how our principles evolve. Perhaps even broadcast the highlights of changes via Outernet for all members to acknowledge and understand.
