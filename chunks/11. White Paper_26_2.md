- Choose a voting method that accommodates offline members: e.g., an online voting platform for those with internet, and a parallel radio/phone voting system. For radio, we can assign code words or numbers to squads: they transmit their vote to a regional relay, which passes to national tally. Use verification (like pre-shared authentication codes per squad to avoid spoofing).  
- Test the voting process on a non-critical issue (say, choose a new logo or motto) to iron out technical kinks and ensure everyone understands how to participate.  
- Create a small election committee from the council or volunteers to oversee vote collection and counting, with observers from different regions (ensuring no bias). If feasible, involve an AI system to tally results quickly and flag any anomalies (like duplicate entries) for human review.  
- Establish regular feedback channels: a digital form and a radio call-in schedule where any member can voice concerns or ideas. Summarize these inputs monthly and share with the council and membership (“You said, we did” reports to show responsiveness).  
- Schedule periodic elections if applicable (for council seats or certain officer roles, maybe every 2 years) and a periodic referendum on any major policy changes (like any amendment to the Trust Doctrine must go to vote).
