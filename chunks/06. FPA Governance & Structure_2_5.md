In sum, the FPA’s circle structure is **bluntly pragmatic**: it pushes decision-making to the edges (where people on the scene often know best) but links those edges together so the alliance moves with unity of purpose. We avoid the chaos of everyone doing their own thing by ensuring **all circles live by the same core playbook and values** – as laid out in this blueprint and related guides like the [[Compass Guide]]. When something big hits, we don’t have to wait for a top boss to tell us what to do; we’re already connected and ready to roll, each circle playing its part within a coherent whole.
