- _Action Steps:_  
- Choose the platform that most locals use. If your community is Facebook-heavy, a Facebook Group or Page might reach best. If not, a simple free website or blog (WordPress, Wix, etc.) can serve. Even an Instagram account can work if you share meaningful visuals (like photos from drills or infographics).  
- Post the basics: who you are, what you do, and how to get involved. Use the FPA branding if appropriate (logo, terminology) to link to the larger movement – this can attract like-minded people. Make sure to include contact methods (an email alias or a contact form that a squad member monitors).  
- Keep content fresh but manageable. Aim to post something at least monthly – perhaps a summary of your meeting or a preparedness tip of the month. Before expected hazards (like “hurricane season starts”), share readiness content. During emergencies, if internet is still up, use the page to broadcast accurate info (this can complement your physical info hub). Always verify what you post in emergencies to avoid spreading rumors.  
- Engage with followers: respond to comments or messages promptly. Even if it’s just to say “Thanks for reaching out, we’ll get back to you with that info,” it shows you’re active. Loop in multiple squad members to help manage online duties to avoid burnout of one “web person.”
