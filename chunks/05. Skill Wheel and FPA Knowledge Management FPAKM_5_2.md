3. **Real-World Skill Demonstrations:** Nothing proves capability like **real-world experience**. If a member has actually _used_ a skill in an emergency or major project, that should be recorded on their profile. For instance, if a hurricane strikes a member’s town and they organize a neighborhood first aid station, or if they have to navigate their family to safety during a wildfire evacuation, those experiences deserve recognition. We do **not** want to encourage members to seek dangerous situations just to boost their scores, but FPA does want to capture when hard-earned experience is gained. In practice, regional coordinators or leadership could enter a “skill credit” for members who demonstrably applied their skills in a real event. For example, someone who successfully administered first aid at a car accident might earn a few points in First Aid (with proper documentation). Real-world demonstrations will likely contribute modestly per incident (since any single event may only cover part of a skill domain), but over time they add up – and they serve as **stories to share**, enriching the member’s profile beyond numbers. This ties into FPA’s [[Trust Doctrine]]: we operate on trust but verify. Significant real-world contributions might require verification (witness statements, after-action reports, or even news clippings for major events) before awarding credit, to prevent any fabrication.
