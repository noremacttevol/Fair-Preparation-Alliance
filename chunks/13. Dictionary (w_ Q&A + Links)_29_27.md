Q28: What’s a get-home bag and do I need one?
A: A get-home bag (GHB) is a small emergency kit specifically meant to help you get back home if a disaster strikes while you’re out. People often keep a GHB in their car or at their workplace. It’s lighter and more streamlined than a full bug-out bag – it’s not for long-term survival, just for the hours or day it might take you to reach home safely. A typical get-home bag might have a pair of comfortable walking shoes (if you normally wear dress shoes to work), water and snacks, a flashlight, a dust mask, a basic first aid kit, a map and compass (in case GPS/cell service is down), and perhaps a light jacket or poncho. The goal is to carry only what you need to travel on foot and overcome minor obstacles between you and home. [#Beginner] [#Logistics]
