- _Data Privacy:_ The AI features require using personal data (skills, location context, etc.) to generate tailored advice. We will strictly protect that data. The AI’s analysis of a member is only seen by that member and appropriate leaders – it’s not public. We will enforce encryption in storage and transmission. Even when sending data over Outernet, as mentioned, we plan to encrypt personal segments so only the intended device can read it. A member’s weaknesses or scores should _not_ fall into the wrong hands or become gossip. Internally, we treat Skill Wheel data with the same confidentiality as we would medical or personnel records. This is explicitly guided by the reliability and ethics plans governing our use of AI and data.
