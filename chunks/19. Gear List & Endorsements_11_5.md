- **Alignment with Other FPA Documents:** This Gear & Endorsements Doctrine is meant to work in harmony with other key FPA documents, namely the Trust Doctrine, the _SHTF Bible_, the Offline Resilience System guide, and the FPA Dictionary of terms. In case of any conflict between documents, the general rule is that ethical principles (Trust Doctrine) override procedural details, and this Gear Doctrine is specialized for gear-related matters. We strive to update all documents together – for example, if this doctrine introduces a new concept like “Alliance-Friendly Vendor,” the FPA Dictionary and any Trust policy will be updated to define how that status is handled broadly. Members should view all these core documents as pieces of a puzzle that fit together; none is meant to be read in isolation. This is why ultimately these will all nest within the Mk1Mod3 binder or library, providing a comprehensive reference. Consistency and coherence across our doctrine set is a priority, and it’s part of the Council’s duty during reviews to ensure we don’t contradict ourselves or leave gaps between policies.
