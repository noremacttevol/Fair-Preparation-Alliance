- **Recovery Phase Technology:** As infrastructure is restored, our communications gradually transition back from emergency mode to normal mode. We move conversations from radio back to phone or internet as those come online. We set up digital groups for survivors (“Facebook group for Hurricane XYZ recovery – moderated by FPA volunteers to share tips and get help”), if not already. We help people connect with official recovery resources by sharing links (once they have connectivity) or helping them fill out forms. Our role is like a bridge between the chaotic immediate aftermath and the longer-term recovery institutions. For those still offline, we keep supporting analog methods until they can transition.
