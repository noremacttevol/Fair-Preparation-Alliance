- **Interoperability:** Gear is chosen to align with common standards so it works together. For instance, radios we recommend operate on frequencies FPA uses (HAM bands or at least GMRS), water filter cartridges are of standard sizes, solar panels and batteries use standard connectors, etc. This way if everyone in a squad has the same type of radio or filter, they can share batteries or cartridges. Standardization also simplifies training and repairs.  
The Approved Gear List is accessible via the app and as a PDF/handout. It’s updated as new products emerge or better deals are found. We mark legacy gear that’s been phased out (so if you see “Gen1 solar charger (Mk1Mod2) – replaced by Gen2 model in Mk1Mod3”, you know what to upgrade eventually). Members can contribute feedback, which a committee reviews before adding or removing items from the official list.  
Crucially, the list also tags gear by **tier of preparedness**.
