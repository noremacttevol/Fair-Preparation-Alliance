Below is a summary table of all **20 standard ranks** in the FPA system (Enlisted E-1 to E-10 and Officer O-1 to O-10), along with the **Prestige option** at the E-10 level. For each rank, the table lists the title, the key required tasks/milestones for promotion, the AP floor (minimum cumulative Alliance Points needed), the validation type required, the path/fork, and the two quantitative metrics – AP slope (additional AP required compared to the previous rank) and validation index (level of validation rigor):
