Power outages and data corruption are anticipated and planned for:  
- **Power Redundancy:** As noted in the SHTF stack, members have backup power sources. We also plan at the infrastructure level: critical devices are on uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) giving time to safely shut down or switch to generator. Solar charging stations are placed at key cache locations. We’ve even identified public infrastructure (like community centers with generators) and made agreements where possible to allow FPA equipment to recharge there in crises. Our drills include “blackout” conditions to practice operating with only backup power.  
- **Data Backup:** Even though data is distributed, we also back up critical organizational data in multiple forms. Encrypted snapshots of the transparency ledger, membership roster (with emergency contacts, etc.), and the Compass Guide are periodically created. These snapshots might be stored in multiple media: cloud storage (with secret sharing split among tribunal members), offline hard drives or USBs kept in secure caches, etc. If all live systems somehow failed, we could restore from these snapshots. Additionally, some key data (like the most essential SOPs and emergency contacts) are printed and included in the physical caches – technology independent backup.
