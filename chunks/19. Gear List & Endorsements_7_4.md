- **Local Squad Access (Private to Local/Regional Groups):** Within the membership, we also have layers of information that are confined to one’s local squad or a specific group. This might include squad-specific gear inventory, local cache locations, or strategies that involve gear placement and use in a community. For instance, a local squad might collectively purchase a high-cost item (like a grain mill or a generator) and share it; the details of its storage and maintenance could be kept within that squad’s records for security reasons. Additionally, some preliminary testing notes might initially live in a local squad’s workspace before being compiled – for example, if a squad is experimenting with a prototype gear that they aren’t ready to fully announce to the broader membership until they have solid results. _Rationale:_ Certain information must remain limited to those who _need to know_. Operational security (OpSec) is important in preparedness; we don’t publish everything to everyone if it could compromise personal or group safety. Local squads often handle resources and plans that, if publicly known, could make them targets (e.g., if it’s known a group has a fuel cache, that could invite theft or unwanted attention). Therefore, while the **outcomes** of all gear tests eventually become Alliance knowledge, the fine-grained details of who has what, or exactly where and how they use it, are kept local. Another reason is focus: local context can clutter global data. By
