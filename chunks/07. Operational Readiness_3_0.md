**Readiness is defined by phase, not mood.** FPA uses escalating phases of activation to ramp up our posture in a controlled way as a situation deteriorates:  
|**Phase**|**Description**|**Trigger Conditions**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Passive Mode**|Ongoing skill-building, routine audits, and low-stakes drills. _Normal preparedness state._|Default day-to-day operations (no active threats).|
|**2. Prepared Mode**|Regular app check-ins, local squad sync-ups, and gear/supply confirmation. _Teams heighten alertness._|Early warning signs (severe weather alerts, fuel shortages, rising tension).|
|**3. Active Readiness**|Field kits staged and ready, radio networks active, rally points reviewed and prepped. _Teams poised to respond._|Imminent crisis in area (disaster within ~100 miles or direct regional threat forecast).|
|**4. System Override**|Full offline SOP stack engaged, AI/app functions paused, and the fallback chain-of-command takes effect. _Teams operate autonomously under pre-set emergency protocols._|Major failure conditions (grid blackout >48 hours, complete communications outage, AI system failure, or widespread civil unrest).|  
Each phase comes with specific member expectations, clear escalation paths, and predetermined command fallbacks (e.g. designated backup leaders for when normal leadership is cut off). As the situation moves from Phase1 to4, authority shifts more locally and procedures become more urgent and robust.
