- **Squad & Resource Support:** FPAi is aware of the community around you – it’s not just an isolated chatbot.

The chatbot can also keep you informed on squad activities – if you ask about upcoming drills or how to join a local squad, it will guide you through it. As you and your squad mates improve your plans and skills, FPAi helps “connect the dots” across everyone’s inputs. This means over time the AI can learn from collective data: it can spot common gaps in your region and suggest
