The design and implementation of the Skill Wheel system has been heavily guided by FPA’s internal principles and strategic documents. We want to ensure it aligns with the organization’s ethos and long-term strategy. Below we cross-reference key internal documents to illustrate that alignment:  
- **SHTF Bible Design Document:** The design doc for the _SHTF Bible_ (our knowledge base) likely outlines how information is structured (possibly by scenario, by category, etc.), how it’s kept up-to-date, and how it’s meant to be used by members. Our Skill Wheel system is built to _leverage_ that content. By mapping skill categories directly to SHTF Bible chapters, we ensure that **training content and assessment criteria are in sync**. The Bible provides the “what you need to know,” and the Wheel tracks “what you have demonstrated knowing.” This means any changes in the SHTF Bible can be reflected in the Skill Wheel. If the Bible adds a new section on, say, _cybersecurity preparedness_, we can introduce a corresponding new skill element. Conversely, if we find through the Skill Wheel data that members consistently lack knowledge in an area, we can check if the Bible needs more content on that. In short, there’s a tight integration: the Skill Wheel is a practical extension of the SHTF Bible, turning the written knowledge into measurable competencies. This feedback loop will keep both the training content and the skill tracking relevant and up-to-date.
