Protecting member privacy is crucial in FPA, both for personal security and to maintain trust in the Alliance.

Upon joining, a new member might share only minimal personal details (first name or alias, general location, skills). The [[Vetting and Screening Process]] collects necessary info (like background and emergency contacts) in a confidential manner.
