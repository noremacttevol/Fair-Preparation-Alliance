- **Membership Growth and Coordination:** With AI smoothing a lot of admin and coordination friction, FPA membership can **scale rapidly** in Phase2. We formalize a structure to manage tens of thousands of members: squads roll up into platoons, companies, and regional brigades as needed (using these military terms loosely to convey scale and hierarchy). **Officer tracks** (leadership roles) expand – we’ll detail this in the Rank Structure section, but suffice to say Phase2 sees more members stepping up to command larger units. The AI helps identify members who consistently perform well or have needed expertise, assisting human leadership in promotions and assignments. (For instance, if one member coordinates supply runs exceptionally and has high peer ratings in the app, the system flags them as a candidate for quartermaster or logistics officer positions).
