officer member might feed them extra info off-duty, or a utility worker friend could whisper where power will be restored first. FPA values these human intel sources highly. Avoiding Rumors: With everyone scared and gossip rampant, FPA makes a conscious effort to verify info. They adopt a bit of a chain-of-trust: if intel is uncertain, they label it as such and might seek a second source. They discourage spreading unvetted rumors among members, as that can cause panic. The intelligence lead might literally say, “Treat this next part as unconfirmed: there’s a rumor of looting in the west side, but we have no direct evidence yet.” By structuring communications this way, members maintain trust in the intel process and don’t overreact to hearsay. In conclusion, FPA treats information as a vital resource – almost as important as food or water. Their coordinated intelligence efforts mean they often know more about what’s happening than the average person, giving them a strategic advantage in making decisions. This is especially crucial when official channels are silent or overwhelmed. The motto could be: “Information is survival.” (Cross-ref: [[Communication Strategy and Layers]] – intelligence gathering relies on those communication methods, and [[Continuous Improvement and AARs]] – after events, the intel process itself is reviewed for what info they missed or misinterpreted, improving future intel operations.)
