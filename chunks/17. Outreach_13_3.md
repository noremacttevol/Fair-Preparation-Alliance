- **Mission above All:** The end goal is a decentralized emergency-ready society. Every tweet, every radio call, every printed flyer is a step toward that vision. Early contributors should act with the knowledge that they are founding something historic – a preparation “constitution” for the people, by the people.  
With this strategy as our guide, we move forward in solidarity and determination. Each member of FPA, especially our leadership and squad founders, is empowered to put these plans into action, adapt them to local needs, and uphold the core values throughout. In doing so, we will not only broadcast messages, but also _build an enduring culture of preparedness_.  
The challenges ahead – natural disasters, infrastructure failures, and unforeseen emergencies – will test us. But armed with this strategy and united in purpose, FPA will rise to those challenges, lighting the way for communities in their darkest hours and illuminating a path to a safer, more resilient future for all.
