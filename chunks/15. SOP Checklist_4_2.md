- **Phase 2 – Specialized Teams and Projects:** With greater numbers comes the ability to form specialized teams. For example, the FPA might establish a **Comms Team** in each region (manning the Outernet frequency and maintaining radio equipment), a **Medical Team**, a **Security Team**, etc. Regular members might choose a track to focus on. Begin considering where you’d fit best. Do you see yourself as part of a rapid response unit traveling to aid neighboring towns? Or maybe contributing to the development of improved SOPs with the AI team? Start deepening the skills that interest you. By Phase 2, we’ll also roll out more advanced **drills** – multi-squad exercises, perhaps regional “mock disasters.” Expect your participation requirements to go up a notch in both complexity and frequency. It won’t be just “have a go-bag” but maybe “help coordinate a community relief event.” Use Phase 1 to build stamina and breadth so Phase 2 doesn’t overwhelm you.
