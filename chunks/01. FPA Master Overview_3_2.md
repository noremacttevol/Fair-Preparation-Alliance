- **Enhanced Communication Network:** With Phase2, we bolster comms via technology. The app enables **secure messaging and alerts** to all members (again, offline-first design means messages queue and send once a path is found, be it internet, SMS, radio packet, etc.). We also tap into the **Outernet** – utilizing satellite data broadcasts to push important Alliance updates globally. For instance, FPA can broadcast an encrypted daily bulletin via the Outernet stream (also known as Othernet) that any member’s receiver can pick up. This includes intel like: areas to avoid, safe rendezvous points, relief convoy schedules, etc. The Outernet feed is one-way but extremely robust (works anywhere with a small receiver dish). Meanwhile, our **7.200MHz pulse frequency** is still active; in fact, Phase2 tech allows linking radio communications with the digital network. Some regional hubs set up radio-Internet gateways that can take a text bulletin and broadcast it in audio via 7.200MHz for those without the app or when digital fails. **Multiple redundant channels** – that’s the goal. If you don’t get the message one way, you’ll get it another.
