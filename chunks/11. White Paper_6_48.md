- Before any meeting, brush up on basic ICS structure. Understand terms like Incident Commander, Command Staff (which includes Liaison Officer role), and the idea of Unified Command ([Working with the Cajun Navy: Optimizing the use of volunteers in disaster response | NSF - National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/news/working-cajun-navy-optimizing-use-volunteers#:~:text=Communication%20between%20volunteers%20and%20formal,coordinated%20to%20help%20dispatch%20volunteers)). This will let you speak their language and show you’re not just random volunteers – you’re organized volunteers.  
- In the meeting, emphasize: your squad’s **capabilities** (manpower, specific skills, languages spoken, equipment like chainsaws or radios), your **limitations** (you’re volunteers, not highly specialized, so they know you won’t, say, fight a structural fire), and your **commitment** to coordinate and not freelance dangerously. Offer to share your contact tree and any plans that might interface with theirs.  
- Suggest a liaison arrangement: during an incident, one squad representative will check in with the Incident Command or EOC, either in person or via radio/phone, to receive assignments or information and to report what the squad is doing. This prevents miscommunication. Essentially, you are providing them an extra team that they don’t have to micromanage, just inform.
