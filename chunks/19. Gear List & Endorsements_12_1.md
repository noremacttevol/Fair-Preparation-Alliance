- **Environmental Test:** Use it in varied conditions (hot, cold, wet, dusty, dark). Log how it performs each time. E.g., “Flashlight left in freezer for 2 hours, then turned on – worked; beam slightly dimmer at 0°C. Radio exposed to rain – no malfunction.”  
- **Usability Test:** Have at least two different people (if possible) use the item following only the included instructions. Note if they find it intuitive or if they struggle. Time tasks (how long to set up tent, assemble stove, etc.).  
- **Off-Grid Suitability:** Assess what the item needs to function (batteries, fuel, solar, manual effort). If it relies on consumables (fuel canisters, filters, batteries), can it use common ones? Did our testers have those on hand? Could it be jury-rigged if spares run out?  
- _Durability & Safety:_ Perform controlled abuse within reason: minor drops, shakes, pressure, etc., to see if it breaks or malfunctions. Check for any safety hazards (sharp edges, excessive heat, fumes, etc.). E.g., “Dropped radio from 4 ft onto grass – no damage. Dropped onto concrete – battery dislodged, back cover cracked.” If any test might destroy the item, do it last or with a secondary unit, and note that it’s a destructive test.
