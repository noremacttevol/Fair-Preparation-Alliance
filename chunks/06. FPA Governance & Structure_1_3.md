- **Pragmatism Over Bureaucracy:** We keep things **lean and pragmatic**. Red tape has no place in a disaster, so we strip our governance of needless bureaucracy. Meetings are for making decisions and solving problems, not for theater. Paperwork is minimal and serves a real purpose (like logging supplies or plans) rather than just covering someone’s backside. This principle lets us respond to fast-changing situations without getting bogged down. **Bluntly put:** if a rule or process isn’t helping get stuff done on the ground, we revise it or remove it. We’d rather have a rough-and-ready solution today than a perfect protocol approved next year. Being strategic doesn’t mean being slow – it means **planning smartly and executing without BS**. Our structure is designed to be firm enough to guide us but flexible enough to bend when reality demands it.  
These foundational beliefs set the tone for everything that follows. They ensure the FPA’s governance is not some hollow paperwork exercise, but a living system geared toward effective, ethical action in tough times.
