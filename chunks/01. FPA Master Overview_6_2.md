- _E-7 to E-9_ – These are **senior enlisted** ranks, often regional coordinators or subject matter experts. An E-7 might be similar to a **Sergeant Major** type for a city or county, overseeing multiple squads. E-8 and E-9 are rare and respected; they typically serve on regional councils or head major programs (for instance, an E-9 might be the lead for the entire Communications network of a state, or the chief instructor for the Alliance’s national training center). These individuals have significant AP – meaning years of service, high-stakes contributions, and near-unimpeachable records of reliability. They often advise the officer-tier leadership and ensure that orders from the top make sense on the ground. If an E-9 speaks, even officers listen – because that respect has been _earned_.
