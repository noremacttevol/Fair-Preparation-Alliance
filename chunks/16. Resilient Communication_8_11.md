**Interoperability and Shared Frequencies:** At the community formation stage, interoperability between different radio services becomes important. Not everyone will have HAM radios; some might have only CB radios, others FRS walkie-talkies. Our comms doctrine suggests equipping squads with a variety of simple radios (even that $30 blister-pack of walkie-talkies from Walmart can talk to locals who have the same). That’s why in the comms module of the mobile unit we include CB and FRS. So an FPA member could act as a bridge: they receive a message from a neighbor on CB (“We need water at location X”), then pass it onto the FPA net or handle it accordingly. We don’t want to exclude valuable info just because it comes over a different device. Thus, we maintain **frequency guides** for common services. For example, channel assignments: “FRS channel 1 is Alliance local aid channel” so any citizen could call on that for help and an FPA member monitoring will respond. Or “CB channel 9 (historically emergency channel) will be monitored at the top of every hour by an FPA base for anyone calling.” These are techniques borrowed from CERT and amateur radio emergency services.
