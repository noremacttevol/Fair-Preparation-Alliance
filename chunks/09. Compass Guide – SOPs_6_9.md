- **Transparency and Trust:** FPA is built on trust – in each other and in the organization itself. That’s why we run things transparently. As mentioned, finances are public within the group (everyone can see where funds go). Decision-making is documented, major changes are put to vote as the Alliance grows, and even our fail-safes for leadership are clear (e.g. if a leader goes down or goes rogue, we have succession protocols and council oversight). We explain this in the Compass Guide because members need to know they’re part of something fair and stable. In a world where many institutions have lost credibility, we aim to earn and keep trust by showing we have nothing to hide. For example, if a region leader has to allocate relief supplies unevenly, they’ll later report why (“Squad A got more water because Squad B was already stocked”). This openness prevents resentment and rumor. It also holds each of us accountable – if you know your squad’s readiness report will be seen by neighboring squads, you’re more likely to keep your gear in shape. We do things above-board, even in a crisis, because it solidifies group cohesion. Dishonesty or secretiveness is corrosive; we can’t afford that. By being transparent, we reinforce our integrity principle and make it easy for good actors to shine and bad actors to be spotted quickly.
