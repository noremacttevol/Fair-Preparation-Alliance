5. **Badge Award & Public Listing:** Gear that passes the vote is awarded the FPA Endorsement Badge – effectively being placed on our **Approved Gear List**. This means the item is now officially recommended by the Fair Preparation Alliance. We create a detailed **Gear Profile** for it on our platforms: including the original rationale for endorsement, key test results, best-use guidelines, and current best price sources. An FPA Endorsement Field Card (see Appendix B) is generated for the item, which members can print and add to their physical resilience binders. The gear is also tagged by visibility level: some endorsements will be fully public (guest-visible), while others might be marked member-only if they contain sensitive details (more on visibility tiers in a later section). _In our example, if the PowerMaxX charger had been endorsed, we’d list it publicly with a summary of its performance (e.g. “Great for sunny climates, unreliable in shade; endorsed for general use with caution to protect it from drops”). We’d also note any negotiated member discount or alternative model if available._ **Rationale:** Awarding a badge and listing the gear accomplishes two things: it publicizes our findings (educating everyone on what gear is truly reliable) and it rewards the manufacturer/vendor of good gear with recognition – _but only earned recognition_. This public listing pressures companies to maintain quality and fair pricing, since an FPA endorsement is a mark of trust that
