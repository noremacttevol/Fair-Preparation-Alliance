together – they merged and are now a more robust 6-person squad with complementary skills. It also identified a 12-person squad that was consistently struggling to meet (too large and geographically spread) – they were split into two squads of 6 based on location clusters; since then participation in meetups improved because travel was reduced and cohesion increased. These changes were done with human judgment in the loop, but the tool’s suggestions made the decisions clearer. We’ve thus **optimized team structures** in at least 5 regions, leading to more active and capable squads.
