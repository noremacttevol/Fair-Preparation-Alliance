Culture of Preparedness: Last but not least, Readiness & Drills works to instill a culture of perpetual preparedness across the Alliance. They celebrate those who put in the effort: highlighting “Prepper of the Month” stories in internal newsletters, awarding badges for 100% drill attendance, etc. They encourage friendly competition (as mentioned, squad vs. squad contests for readiness metrics). They also collaborate with Comms & Outreach to run community events like free public preparedness workshops, which doubles as recruitment. Their message inside and outside the Alliance is consistent: “Preparedness is not a hobby, it’s a lifestyle.” And they lead by example — the folks in this team are often the most hardcore preppers among us, but they channel that passion into lifting everyone’s capabilities.  
In summary, Readiness & Drills makes sure the Fair Preparation Alliance truly walks the walk. This family won’t allow preparedness to remain theory – they turn it into practice, habit, and instinct. Through rigorous training, constant drilling, and high standards, they transform a diverse group of individuals into a disciplined force ready to face disaster head-on. When the sirens wail or the ground shakes, it’s too late to prepare – so this team ensures we prepare now. Every sweat-drenched training and late-night study session is a down payment on survival when it counts, and they will not let us default on that payment.
