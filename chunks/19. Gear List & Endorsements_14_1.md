- **Readiness Cred (RC):** The “trust currency” of FPA. Points or credit that members earn by contributing to the community – such as participating in gear tests, helping others, leading training, providing useful intel, etc. Higher Readiness Cred increases a member’s reputation and can grant additional responsibilities or slight voting weight in certain decisions. It is a measure of demonstrated commitment and expertise.  
- **Squad:** A local or thematic subgroup of FPA members who coordinate closely. Squads are often based on geographic location (e.g., “Metro City Squad”) but can also be specialized (e.g., “Comms Squad” for radio enthusiasts). Squads conduct local drills, share resources, and often spearhead gear tests in their area. Each squad typically has a leader or coordinator. Squads play a key role in our decentralized structure and voting.  
- **Trust Doctrine:** A separate foundational document of FPA that outlines the ethical framework and trust system for the Alliance. It includes guidelines on transparency, conflict of interest, honesty, member rights and duties, and how trust (like Readiness Cred) is managed. The Gear Endorsements Doctrine operates under the umbrella of principles from the Trust Doctrine.
