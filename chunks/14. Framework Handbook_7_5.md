> **Legacy Note:** Where you might see old terminology like “Cell Leaders” or “Prepper Pods” in Mk1Mod2 documents, Mk1Mod3 refers to these as “Squad Leaders” and “Squads” respectively to standardize language. We flag these changes throughout the text for clarity. The Canonical Terminology Bundle at the end of this book provides a glossary mapping any legacy terms to their Mk1Mod3 equivalents.
