- **Communications Module:** This is effectively a **“shack-in-a-box”** containing at minimum: a multi-band HAM radio transceiver (e.g. portable HF/VHF radio or a dual-band VHF/UHF handy-talkie with high-gain antenna), a backup FRS/GMRS handheld (for license-free local comms), a microphone, headset, and necessary cables. Many squads also include a CB radio or a marine band radio if relevant to their area (for interoperability with truckers or boats). The comms module often has its own small battery or supercapacitor so it can operate while the main battery is swapped or in transit. Critically, it contains an **antenna kit**: wire dipoles, collapsible whip antennas, maybe a roll-up J-pole for VHF, and some cord to hoist antennas into trees. This allows the squad to set up a proper station anywhere – high ground, a clearing, a rooftop – in minutes. Some teams store a pre-tuned long-wire antenna with the unit, which, combined with a thrown line over a tree, can enable HF communications (long-range) from a backwoods location. The entire module is hardened in a weatherproof case (many use mil-spec Pelican cases or ammo cans). When moving, the sensitive electronics ride inside a Faraday bag or a shielded compartment within the case, which can be closed during an EMP alert or when not in use.
