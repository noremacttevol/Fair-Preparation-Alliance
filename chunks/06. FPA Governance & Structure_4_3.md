- **Advanced Ranks & Leadership:** Some members step up to greater leadership – whether by leading a circle, heading a project, or contributing deep expertise. These could be informally called Senior Members, Circle Leads, Coordinators, or other titles defined in our FPA Dictionary. Importantly, these ranks are **role-based and term-limited** as described earlier. A Circle Lead holds a higher rank _only for as long as they hold that role_. If they step down or reach the end of their term, they return to being a regular Core Member (they might remain an advisor or elder, but the point is they’re not “above” others for life). We avoid an entrenched “old guard” by making rank something you actively carry, not a badge you get to stash and pull rank with whenever you want. Even our Board (if we formalize one in the future) would operate more as a council of active role-holders rather than a permanent high rank. **Dual-role limits** also apply at this level: no one should monopolize multiple top positions simultaneously. If you’re already a regional coordinator, you shouldn’t also be the treasurer _and_ head trainer at once – spread the responsibility to keep us agile and honest.
