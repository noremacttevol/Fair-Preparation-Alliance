This document outlines the **full FPA rank structure from E-1 to O-10**, including rank titles, requirements for advancement, AP thresholds, and validation processes. It also describes the **Alliance Points system** (how members earn points via various activities), the **two post-Enlisted paths (Officer and Prestige)**, and the **principles of fairness** underlying the system. This structured approach ensures that as members advance, they develop critical survival skills (like planning, communication, and leadership) in a logical order, strengthening both the individual and the Alliance as a whole.
