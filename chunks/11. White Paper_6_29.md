12. **Milestone 12: First Aid & CPR Certification for Members**  
- _Real-World Example:_ During a heatwave response, a squad member’s quick CPR on a heatstroke victim saved a life before paramedics arrived. That member had taken a basic CPR/AED course offered free at the YMCA. In another case, after a building explosion, a prepared squad in the vicinity treated bleeding wounds and fractures on multiple victims because half the team were trained in first aid. These scenarios underline how basic medical know-how is often the difference in the crucial first 10 minutes of an emergency.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ In disasters, professional medical help might be minutes or hours away. **Every squad member should ideally have basic first aid and CPR skills.** It’s one of the most empowering trainings – turning a bystander into a lifesaver. Even teens can learn these skills. **Lesson:** First aid training is low-cost (often free) and high-impact. Additionally, squads with medical proficiency gain trust; neighbors will turn to you for help if they know you’re trained, amplifying your positive impact.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Identify free or affordable first aid/CPR training in your area. Red Cross chapters frequently run classes, sometimes sponsored by community organizations. Fire departments or hospitals might do periodic trainings for the public. Leverage personal connections if any member works in healthcare or emergency services to arrange a session.
