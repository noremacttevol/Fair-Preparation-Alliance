- **Off-grid power for comms:** As part of your Phase1.3 supplies, ensure you have a way to power your communication tools. This could be as simple as a pack of AA batteries and a solar battery charger (some models ~$20). If you have a car, a DC car charger for your devices is a must (you can use your car as a generator sparingly). If budget allows, a small solar panel (20W-100W) with a charge controller and deep-cycle battery can keep radios and phones charged indefinitely – many hams set up such systems for Field Day. Practice using these: know how many hours of sun to charge your radio, etc.  
- **Know your information sources:** Pre-download maps of your area on your phone (offline maps) and key references (like first aid guides, the FPA Compass PDF, etc.) so you’re not reliant on live internet. Consider getting physical maps and a printed contact list of emergency numbers (police, fire, neighbors). If you have a shortwave radio (many NOAA radios double as shortwave receivers), note frequencies of stations like the BBC or other international broadcasters which often can be heard when local stations are down. In Phase3, FPA plans to broadcast updates via certain channels – those will be communicated (e.g., an HF radio frequency where FPA national net operates). Make sure to update your notes with those once available.  
**Phase1.6: Implement a mentorship & skill-sharing system so each new member is paired with an experienced member by 2025.**
