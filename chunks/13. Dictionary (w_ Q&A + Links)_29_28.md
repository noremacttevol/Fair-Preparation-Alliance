Q29: What is a bug-out location (BOL)?
A: A bug-out location (BOL) is the place you plan to go if you must evacuate (bug out) from your home. It’s essentially your safe haven in a crisis. Ideally, a BOL is a pre-selected, secure, and stocked location outside of the immediate danger zone. For many people, a BOL might be a cabin in the woods, a relative’s house in a rural area, or a campsite away from the city. The key is that it’s a location you’ve thought out in advance – you know how to get there, and you’ve prepared it (or at least know it has what you need). A good BOL has shelter, a water source, and distance from civil unrest or hazards. It’s the destination that gives your bug-out plan an end point, rather than evacuating aimlessly.
