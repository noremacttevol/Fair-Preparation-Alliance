Another use of E-10: if a member in the field performs a truly heroic one-off action (say, negotiating the peaceful surrender of a violent group during a crisis, saving dozens of lives), they might receive a field promotion to E-10 as a commendation. They might still be, say, an E-4 for their day-to-day duties, but everyone knows their extraordinary merit has been formally recognized. In military terms, think of it like receiving a medal that also confers a title.  
In summary, FPA’s rank structure (E-1 through E-9 enlisted, an officer corps, and the special E-10 honors) combined with the AP system provides a clear pathway for growth and leadership. It encourages everyone to pull their weight, learn continuously, and step up when ready. By tying rank to real contributions and maintaining checks and balances, we avoid the pitfalls of both anarchy and tyranny. The Alliance remains disciplined but dynamic, with fresh talent always rising and seasoned hands guiding them. Your goal as a member: rack up AP by doing the work, advance in rank, and use that position to help others – that’s how the Alliance as a whole gets stronger.
