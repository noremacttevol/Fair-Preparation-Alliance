structures – for example, suggesting committees for essential functions (food, safety, health, infrastructure) that report to a council. If multiple FPA-run communities sprout, they’d likely send delegates to meet with others to coordinate regionally (a bit of a confederation model). Importantly, FPA governance would avoid dictatorship or might-makes-right scenarios: the whole point of fair preparation is to preserve civility and ethics even when formal government is absent. In summary, FPA envisions a grassroots democracy of sorts for the long term – small, fair, and federated – rather than a new nation-state led by FPA. Their preparation is as much about instilling the knowledge to self-govern ethically as it is about stockpiling goods. [#Advanced] [#Governance]
