points rather than truly internalizing skills. We are very conscious of that pitfall – our system focuses heavily on practical demonstration and verification, not just accumulating certificates. Also, the way militaries summarize unit readiness (like the US Army’s color-coded C-level ratings for units) shows it is possible to communicate a complex readiness state simply, but it must be done carefully to be truthful. Our approach to an overall survivability score with detailed breakdowns is analogous – a simple summary backed by nuanced detail.
