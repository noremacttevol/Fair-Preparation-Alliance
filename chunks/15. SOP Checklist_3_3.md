In summary, **Alliance Points are your motivator and measurement.** Treat them as a fun challenge: “How many points can I rack up this month by doing things that genuinely make me and my community more prepared?” Before you know it, you’ll look back and realize how far you’ve come – not because of some arbitrary score, but because each point represented a real step forward.  
_(Curious what tasks give what points? Check the FPA member portal or ask a leader for the AP allocation chart. It lists common activities and their values. But generally, if you’re doing what’s on this checklist and then some, the points will follow.)_
