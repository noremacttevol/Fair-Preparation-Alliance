- _Infrastructure Expansion:_ As squads multiply, think about the physical infrastructure needed. For instance, establishing a small storage unit or container that multiple squads can access for regional cache (with tents, blankets, tools to supply any squad that needs surge resources). Or if your area is installing radio repeaters or community Wi-Fi, advocate to include FPA needs (like dedicated channel or network for disaster comms). Work with local government or sponsors to allocate space – maybe an unused office becomes a volunteer coordination center used by all squads. **Scalability** means moving from one-team ad-hoc solutions to multi-team systems. Each squad can still run itself, but there might be shared assets and centralized support for things like advanced training (one radio instructor teaches all squads together – efficient and uniform). Phase 3 will formalize much of this, but Phase 2 should lay the groundwork by having squads consciously collaborate and by designing solutions with replication in mind (no single-squad snowflakes – create models any squad can follow).  
- **Accessibility:** Every action in Phase 2 is designed with low-cost or no-cost alternatives so that even vulnerable members can participate and benefit. Key accessibility principles include:
