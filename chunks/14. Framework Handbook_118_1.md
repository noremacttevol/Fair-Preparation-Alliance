**Mk1Mod3 Recap:** Through strategic shifts (expanding our mission to whole communities, embedding fairness), cultural evolution (trust as our bedrock, teamwork over lone-wolf ethos), and operational enhancements (squad structure, SOPs, offline-first tech, and dynamic logistics), FPA has dramatically upgraded what preparedness looks like. It’s more **integrated** – each piece, from the Trust Doctrine to the AI assistant, reinforces the others. It’s more **inclusive** – anyone can partake and benefit, not just those with means or prior experience. And it’s more **effective** – we now have seen evidence, even if anecdotal, from drills and crises that FPA’s approach can blunt the impact of disasters and save lives.  
This Mk1Mod3 handbook is meant to be a foundation. It codifies what we do and why we do it, serving both as an introduction for new members and a reference for veterans. But it’s not the final word. In the spirit of continuous improvement that runs through our doctrine, this manual itself will evolve. We structured it in modular chapters anticipating that Mk1Mod4, Mk1Mod5, etc., will come with new lessons and perhaps new challenges to address.
