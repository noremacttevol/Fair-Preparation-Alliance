Phase2 is essentially about **connecting the dots**. We transform the Skill Wheel from a standalone concept into something woven into daily FPA operations and technology. By the end of Phase2, members should be regularly interacting with their Skill Wheel via the app, and leaders should be incorporating it into training plans and mission prep. We will also handle scaling challenges during this phase: ensuring our database can handle all members, implementing data security measures (so that privacy is maintained as more people access the system), and refining user roles/permissions (so members can see only their data, leaders can see their teams, etc., in line with FPAâ€™s data policies).
