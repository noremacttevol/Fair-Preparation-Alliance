All members are briefed on these tiers and why they matter. We encourage a culture where knowledge flows upward (from squads to the alliance) in a summarized form, and downward (from alliance to public) in a controlled form. This tiered approach protects our communityâ€™s interests while still pushing our mission of truth outward. In practice, it means as a member you have privileged information that can guide your personal preparations more deeply than any outsider could get, and as a guest you have enough information to see the value of what FPA does and hopefully be inspired to join or at least make better gear choices.
