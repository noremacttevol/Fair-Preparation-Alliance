- **Community Vetting:** With a robust rank and reputation system in place, FPA can entrust vetting to the community at scale. For example, beyond ~50k users, the **role of central admin in approvals is minimal**. Instead, high-ranking members (or a small panel in each region) can review new applications flagged by AI. The **“Yellow” queue might be handled by regional officers** rather than a national team, spreading out the work and authority. The [[Trust Doctrine]] envisions _community-sourced quality filters dominating_ at this size – practically, this could mean things like a new applicant’s answers being visible (anonymized) to a few randomly selected veteran members for blind review and scoring, with the AI taking their input into account.
