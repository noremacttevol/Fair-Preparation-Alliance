**Actionable Steps:**  
- Draft a rank structure proposal with input from Phase 2 squad leaders. For example: Enlisted E-1 through E-9 corresponding to regular members and local specialists; E-10 reserved for those with exceptional service record (a bit like a lifetime achievement that still keeps them operational). Officer O-1 through O-3 for local squad leadership positions, O-4 through O-6 for regional leadership, O-7 through O-9 for national directors or council roles, and O-10 as a ceremonial top rank (e.g., National Chairperson of FPA Council).  
- Define each rank’s general role and responsibilities in a simple guideline document (e.g., “O-3 (Squad Leader): leads a local squad, coordinates local training and missions, liaises with O-5 regional lead” etc.). Keep it straightforward to avoid corporate-style bloating.  
- Create insignia or titles that are easy to use. We might not use military titles directly (to avoid confusion with actual military); perhaps we use terms like “Squad Leader,” “Regional Officer,” “National Councilor,” but map them to O-ranks for internal reference. The E-10 might be dubbed “Master Responder” or similar, as an honorary title.  
- Update the FPA Dictionary and Compass Guide with these definitions so every member can refer to them. Also, publish a one-pager cheat sheet that can be distributed at meetings or via Outernet for those offline.
