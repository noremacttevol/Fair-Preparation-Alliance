used in comms to obscure meaning (as mentioned in [[4.15 Communication Security & Encryption]]). Additionally, they consider the longevity and safety of knowledge storage – USB drives and hard drives are periodically checked and replaced to avoid data rot; paper is stored with moisture absorbers to prevent mold. The Alliance also respects privacy: personal data of members is kept on a need-to-know basis (the contact list isn’t freely accessible to everyone, to prevent potential misuse or leaks). In larger sense, knowledge security also means ensuring accuracy – guarding against misinformation. Thus, editing rights to the vault are limited to authorized folks, and changes are tracked. Any critical instructions are double-checked by another pair of eyes before dissemination, to avoid sabotage or mistakes creeping in. Through these measures, FPA recognizes that knowledge is power, and thus secures its intellectual resources diligently, so that in times of chaos the information they rely on is trustworthy and only in the hands of those who should have it.
