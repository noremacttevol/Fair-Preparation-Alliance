The policy here is not to explicitly advertise the full extent of FPA’s network to outsiders (to avoid infiltration or being targeted), but to present a positive, helpful face that can attract quality individuals who may become future members. For example, an FPA member might run a podcast on emergency preparedness (which is part of the Outernet plan) – it serves the public and also indirectly showcases the mindset of FPA, potentially drawing interest from like-minded listeners. When dealing with external offers of collaboration, FPA evaluates them based on alignment with values and security risk.
