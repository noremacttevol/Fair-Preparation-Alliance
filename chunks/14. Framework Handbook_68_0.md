Experience (and disaster research) shows that without clear procedures, people can freeze up or miss crucial steps in an emergency. In after-action reports of major disasters, we often see that miscommunication and ad hoc responses led to delays and mistakes. By having SOPs, FPA ensures a coordinated, effective response. The Compass Guide was developed to unify our approach:  
- Under Mk1Mod2, different squads sometimes had their own methods for the same scenario. One group’s way of handling a neighborhood fire differed from another’s, which caused confusion when they tried to help each other. Now, with the Compass SOPs, all squads follow the **same basic checklist** for key events.  
- An SOP doesn’t mean creativity or judgment is eliminated – it just covers the essential base steps so nothing critical is overlooked. Members are still expected to think and adapt, but the SOP gives them a solid starting point and sequence.
