#### Alignment Pass – Canonical Tool Logic & AI Layer Clarification  
The following innovations are now verified against the glossary and readiness matrix:  
- **OpCheck**: Integrated as the default diagnostic trigger for all AI-generated protocols. Every AI-suggested action must include an OpCheck step or it is marked non-canonical.
- **Skill Delta**: Drives scenario difficulty scaling. TMP and FPAi use real-time Skill Delta to suggest role-fit, task difficulty, or partner matching in drills.
- **Gear Pool**: AI systems now flag unauthorized role attempts based on sync’d gear tier logic. Used as a boundary check in all live-plan routes.
- **Squad Wheel**: Squad AI analytics surface cohesion scores, trust drift, and sync lags. Used in predictive warnings during field simulations.  
All entries above are validated against Mk1Mod3 glossary tags and fully conform to Sync Dashboard schema version 3.2+.
