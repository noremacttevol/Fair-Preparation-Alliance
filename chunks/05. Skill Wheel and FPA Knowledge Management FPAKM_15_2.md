Additionally, the system will incorporate **positive reinforcement messaging** to keep motivation high. When a member improves a segment of their wheel, they might receive a congratulatory message or notification: “Great job – your First Aid skills are improving!” If a segment’s score drops (say, because a certification expired), the system will frame it as a supportive reminder: “Your First Aid certification has lapsed; time to refresh this skill to maintain readiness – you’ve got this!” The tone throughout is **encouraging, not punitive**. This aligns with FPA’s culture of mutual support and teamwork; the goal is to lift members up, not knock them down for shortcomings.
