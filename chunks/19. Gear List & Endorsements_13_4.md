Members can use these cards in the field. Many carry the cards in a small index folder or laminate and attach them to the gear itself (e.g., tape the card inside the lid of a generator or in a pouch with the water filter). The Alliance provides PDF packs of all current Field Cards periodically for members to print and update their collection.
