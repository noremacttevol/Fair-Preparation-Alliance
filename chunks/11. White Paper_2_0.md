**Overview:** Phase1 focuses on fortifying each member’s personal preparedness. The goal is **to turn every individual into a reliable first responder for themselves and their family.** In blunt terms, before you can help anyone else, you need your own oxygen mask on. This phase establishes the foundation: emergency plans, basic supplies, personal skills (like first aid and communications), and familiarity with FPA tools. We emphasize **self-reliance** _and_ smart use of technology – for example, using the FPA’s AI planning tools to refine your emergency plan, but also having analog backups in case the power is out. By the end of Phase1, an FPA member should be **capable of surviving at least two weeks completely off-grid** and communicating with the outside world without the internet or cell network. Phase1 is also about mindset: brutally honest self-assessment and improvement. Members will learn to identify their own plan’s weak points (through “Test My Plan” drills) and fix them proactively. This phase instills the habit of **continuous preparedness improvement**, which will carry into Phases2 and3.
