**Guided by the Compass:** The FPA Compass Guide and FPAi voice principles set the standard for how we communicate. Our tone is deliberately **steady and guiding** – like a compass in a storm. We speak with calm authority, even when addressing dire scenarios. Panic is never part of our vocabulary; empowerment is. The voice should be that of a knowledgeable mentor or a field commander with a reassuring hand on the shoulder: confident but never arrogant, urgent but never frantic, principled but never preachy.  
**Key Voice Characteristics:**  
- **Calm & Reassuring:** In crisis communications, people take cues from tone. We convey controlled urgency – factual description of risks with clear steps, never hyperbole. Even our pre-crisis outreach avoids sensationalism. For example, instead of “**Deadly earthquake could strike any time!**,” we frame “**We know earthquakes are a question of when, not if – here’s how we prepare to stay safe.**” The difference is subtle but critical: always inform, never terrify.
