- **Organizational Structure & Discipline:** This content family also defines how we organize ourselves structurally. It maintains the **squad-platoon-company** hierarchy and ensures every member is accounted for in the chain of command. Core Coordination issues and updates the **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** that everyone follows. These SOPs cover everything from how to file a situation report to how to request resources or escalate a problem up the chain. The tone is deliberately **direct and tactical** – no bureaucracy, just clear steps. When something isn’t working (say confusion in a drill due to unclear orders), it’s Core Coordination that revises the SOP or structure to fix it. They’re obsessive about eliminating friction and ambiguity. They’ll cut redundant steps, flatten hierarchy if needed, or tighten it if control is lacking – whatever makes us more effective and agile.
