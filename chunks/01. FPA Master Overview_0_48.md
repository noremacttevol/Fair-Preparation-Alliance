Internal Communications: This wing ensures every member, from the newest recruit to the highest officer, knows what’s happening and what’s expected. The Comms team curates and disseminates regular internal updates: daily situation reports, weekly newsletters, urgent alerts, and so on. In Phase2 and beyond, much of this flows through the app via push notifications (drill announcements, policy changes, intel bulletins). But they also recognize not everyone lives on their phone, so they maintain multichannel comms. Important updates might go out via email, SMS blasts, and be posted on regional bulletin boards (digital forums or even physical notice boards as backup). Comms maintains the protocols for the 7.200MHz pulse frequency as well. For example, they script what is said during the nightly radio pulse (e.g., “This is FPA National with the 1900 hours pulse: All clear today. Reminder: regional drill this Saturday 0800. Stay ready. Pulse out.”). They coordinate with Tech to ensure members without the app still get messages (even if it means printing flyers for a meetup if needed). The overall goal: no member is left uninformed.
