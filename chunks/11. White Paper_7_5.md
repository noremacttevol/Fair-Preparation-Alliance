- **NGO Partnerships:** As covered in milestones, link up with NGOs. Integration protocols might include: attending Red Cross coordination meetings, having the squad Liaison join the VOAD conference calls, or even getting on the contact list for organizations like Team Rubicon, Salvation Army, etc. The Liaison should maintain a list of key NGO contacts (shelter manager, food bank director, etc.) and ideally meet them periodically so you’re not strangers. In disaster, the Liaison can call those contacts to coordinate – e.g., “Our squad can run local distribution if you send supplies” or “We have 10 volunteers ready, where can the food bank use us?” These relationships also come with understanding each other’s protocols; e.g., Red Cross may have certain paperwork for shelter volunteers, which your Liaison can secure ahead of time for your members to be rapidly sworn in if needed. In essence, pre-plan how your spontaneous volunteers become affiliated volunteers with the NGOs to reduce liability and confusion.
