- **Time Constraints and Burnout:** Life is busy. If a member falls behind on milestones due to work, family, or plain burnout, the contingency is to **prioritize and simplify.** Mentors will help refocus on the 20% of tasks that give 80% of the benefit. It’s okay to adjust the timeline – preparedness isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. If someone can’t attend that CERT course this quarter, schedule the next one and maybe do some interim self-study. If daily life intervenes (new baby, job loss), we pause and resume when possible. FPA leadership will monitor general progress; if many individuals are missing a particular milestone, maybe our expectations or support need adjusting. We will remain flexible. One concrete measure: we maintain an online checklist for Phase1 that members update – if we see lots of incomplete items, we’ll do “catch-up months” focusing on those via additional workshops or motivational challenges. We also combat burnout by reminding _why_ we do this: real stories of lives saved because of a prep. The tone stays blunt but also encouraging: **you’re doing this for your family’s survival, so keep pushing.**
