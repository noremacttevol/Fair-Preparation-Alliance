**ID:** FPA-GEAR-2024-0157 – **Endorsed (Active)** – _Endorsed Aug 2024_
**Summary:** Compact gravity water filter for camping and emergency use (family-sized).
**Why Endorsed:**  
- _Reliable:_ Tested filtering 1800L with no failure; strong housing.  
- _Fast & Efficient:_ Filters ~4L per hour – among fastest in class.  
- _Accessible:_ Moderately priced (~$40) and widely available (multiple suppliers).
**Usage Tips:**  
- Fill the bag completely to maximize flow; hang at least 5 feet above container.  
- If flow slows, stir or shake water bag to dislodge sediment.  
- After each use, backflush with clean water (included backflush pump).
**Off-Grid:** No power needed. All gravity; just needs clean container to collect water.  
_Back:_
**Specs:** Weight 1.1 lbs; Size 12”x 8” (rolled); Filter life ~1500L; Removes bacteria/protozoa (0.1 micron); Activated carbon reduces chemicals for ~300L.
**Test Results:** 3 of 3 test units met filtration claims. Filtered pond, rain, and floodwater – output safe per lab tests. Cold weather: filter must be protected from freezing (one tester’s filter cracked after water inside froze).
**Limitations:** Doesn’t eliminate viral contaminants alone – use disinfectant drops if virus suspected. Not for desalination (salt water will ruin filter).
**Maintenance:** Clean out sediment pre-filter every use. Backflush every 20L or when flow slows. Let dry before long-term storage to prevent mold. Replace carbon element yearly if used frequently.
