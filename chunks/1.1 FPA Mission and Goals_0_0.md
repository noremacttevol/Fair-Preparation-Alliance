The Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) is a grassroots network devoted to empowering preppers nationwide. Its mission is to unify individual preparedness efforts into a fair, collaborative alliance that benefits all members. Key goals include: (a) enhancing the resilience of members and their communities against disasters, (b) promoting fairness and mutual aid in survival planning, and (c) leveraging collective knowledge and resources so that members not only survive crises but can eventually thrive afterward. FPA’s mission statement emphasizes preparedness with integrity – balancing self-sufficiency and community support so that no committed member is left behind when crisis strikes. All initiatives and programs in FPA are aligned to this core mission, ensuring that individual preppers become part of a cohesive, supportive network rather than isolated actors. The Alliance’s motto reflects these aims, underscoring fairness, trust, and empowerment as guiding principles for all its activities.
