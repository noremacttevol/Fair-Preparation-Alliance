Besides communication, the blueprint addresses data:  
- **Local Servers:** Some squads run small servers (like a Raspberry Pi or similar) that host useful data accessible on the mesh network. This can include maps of the area, a digital copy of the SHTF Bible, first aid videos, and a bulletin board for the community. Even if the internet is cut, these local “intranet” resources can be lifesavers. For example, an offline map server means anyone on the mesh can load detailed maps on their phone without needing Google.  
- **Hard Copy Maps and Lists:** Offline-first means also non-electronic. The blueprint reminds squads to keep hard-copy maps of their region (with key locations marked, like hospitals, shelters, squad member addresses). It also advises printing important contact lists – not just phone numbers (which might not work) but addresses and radio call signs for members and allies. There’s nothing more frustrating than knowing there’s another FPA squad a few miles away but not knowing exactly where or how to reach them if digital systems are dead.
