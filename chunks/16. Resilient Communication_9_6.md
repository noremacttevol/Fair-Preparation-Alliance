etc.). Our comm plans are built around those bands, ensuring that what we plan to use matches gear members actually own. If the endorsements list says “Baofeng UV-5R” (for example) is a common low-cost radio our members use, the doctrine will include instructions specific to that (like how to mod it for extended receive, which battery pack lasts longest, etc.). Conversely, the doctrine might highlight a need (“we need a more EMP-resistant HF rig for long range”) which Gear team can fulfill by finding a model to endorse (maybe a simple analog rig kit).
