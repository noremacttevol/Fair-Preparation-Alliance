This document tells every Bubble.io engineer **exactly** what to build first, why, and how to know when it’s finished. It supersedes all prior “Dev MVP & App Content” notes.  
|Why this doctrine exists|How we judge every push to _live_|
|---|---|
|Collapse multi‑year white‑board ideas into one canon so the Bubble team is never guessing priorities.|✅ Protect **member trust** · ✅ Enforce **offline‑first** fallbacks · ✅ Keep Bubble **simple‑but‑scalable**. Any “No” ⇒ back to design.|  
**Foundational Principles**  
1. **Trust‑First Engineering** — every new workflow publishes to the [[Live Audit Feed]] and ships with rollback + human‑override.  
2. **Offline by Default** — if the cloud dies, members still print, radio, or PWA‑cache the data.  
3. **AI = Assistant, never Admin** — GPT calls surface advice; people approve actions.  
4. **Modular Bubble Pages** — isolate domains (Inflow, Content, Trust, Drills) into reusable Components; easier to version, hide, or fork.
