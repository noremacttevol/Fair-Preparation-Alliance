(say regional leads have different views), FPA tries to resolve quickly via the pre-set hierarchy or consensus if time allows. In a prolonged crisis, they might even rotate leadership if someone is exhausted or not performing well (e.g., a chapter lead might voluntarily hand off to their deputy after 48 hours to rest). The chain of command is thus somewhat flexible to ensure effective leadership at all times. Logging Decisions: A small but important practice is that leaders (or a scribe) often keep a log of major decisions and actions (time, decision taken, reason if noteworthy). This helps later to review what happened and clarifies if confusion arises (“Did we already send a scout to that area or not? Let’s check the log.”). Summaries might later feed into after-action reviews. Essentially, FPA’s coordination structure means when chaos hits, everyone isn’t pulling in different directions. There’s an understood game plan of who coordinates and how info flows. Members find comfort in this clarity, and it markedly increases efficiency. Even though they’re volunteers and equals in normal times, in emergencies they act as a cohesive unit under leadership they chose and trust. This balance of discipline and flexibility is a hallmark of FPA’s crisis management.
