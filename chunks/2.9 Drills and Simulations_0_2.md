Medical Emergencies: The group may stage a medical emergency drill. For example, one member acts out a serious injury or illness during a meeting or exercise. The others must respond: provide first aid, call for help (or simulate no external help available, meaning they must rely on their skills), and decide on evacuation. This tests the [[Emergency Medical Preparedness]] training and the availability of first aid gear. It also reveals leadership under pressure – who takes charge, how effectively do they communicate.  
“Test My Plan” Simulations: The formal [[“Test My Plan” Program]] often runs as a structured drill. A member volunteers their personal emergency plan to be tested by the group. The group then throws a hypothetical crisis at that member (e.g., a wildfire approaching their home) and the member executes their plan: contacting who they said they would, packing what they planned, etc., while others observe or role-play needed roles (like a neighbor or a family member). The group then provides feedback – maybe the member forgot an essential item or the evacuation route was clogged. This helps refine individual plans and also educates everyone on diverse scenarios.
