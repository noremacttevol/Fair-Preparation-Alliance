- **Long-Term Evaluation and Evolution:** With several years of data and experience now, we will evaluate how the Skill Wheel correlates with real-world outcomes. Do members with higher Skill Wheels actually fare better in emergencies? Are there any skills we weighted too heavily or not enough? Perhaps we discover a new skill area that was not originally in the wheel but proves important. We will use this information to carefully evolve the system. For example, we might decide to add a new segment (if a major domain was missing) or adjust the internal weightings of certain skills. Any changes will be done with extreme care and transparency – likely we would archive old metrics so members can still see their historical progress even if we rescale something. The idea is to continuously improve the tool’s accuracy and usefulness over the long term.  
Throughout all phases, **member communication and training about the system itself** remains crucial. We will likely create a dedicated “Skill Wheel Guidebook” or section in the SHTF Bible that clearly explains how the system works, how to interpret your profile, and how to use it to set personal goals. In Phase1 this is delivered in-person (briefings, Q&A sessions). In Phases2 and 3, we’ll supplement with in-app tutorials or videos for new features (for example, a quick tutorial when we introduce the new dashboard, or a guide on how to request a mentor through the app if that feature is added).
