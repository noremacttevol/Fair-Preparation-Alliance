**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** Next, we plan to integrate Merit Points with tangible rewards and deeper community functions. In the coming month, we will: (a) Launch **exclusive tier rewards** – e.g., members reaching _1000 points_ get priority access to new gear field-tests or a 1:1 survival coaching session. (b) Introduce a **Chapter Leaderboard**, so local groups can collectively compete (this fosters teamwork – a whole squad earns a badge if all members reach a goal). (c) Refine the points logic with member feedback, ensuring it rewards truly valuable actions (quality contributions over quantity). We’re also tying Merit Points into the Trust Graph (Innovation 11) – high-merit members could have their reputation visually highlighted, reinforcing trust. Within 30 days we aim to have the **Merit Points SOP** finalized, documenting how points correlate to roles and privileges.  
**Links to FPA Resources:** The **FPA Dictionary** defines “Merit Points” and the rules for earning them【Dictionary†L15-L21】. For guidance on implementation, see the _Gamification_ section of the **Compass Guide**, which aligns this initiative with our values of self-improvement and mutual encouragement【CompassGuide†L30-L37】. Also reference the **Trust Doctrine** on meritocracy in trust-building【TrustDoctrine†L5-L9】, which underpins why this system increases credible engagement.
