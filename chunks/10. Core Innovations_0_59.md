**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** Next up: (a) **Refinement of reputation algorithms** – we’ll incorporate more inputs, possibly including the quality of contributions (as rated by mentors or via outcomes of tasks) not just quantity. We will also implement a decay function (trust should be maintained, so if someone becomes inactive or stops contributing for a long time, certain aspects of reputation might slowly wane, though legacy contributions will still be noted). (b) **Transparency & Education**: roll out a “Understanding Your Trust Profile” guide for members, so they know how to improve their reputation legitimately (basically by helping others and participating). We want to ensure the system is well-understood and not seen as some black box or popularity contest. (c) **Integration with decision-making**: In the next 30 days, chapter leaders will start using trust scores as one factor in selecting team leads or granting higher responsibilities. We will formalize that process to make sure it’s fair (e.g., considering trust level alongside skills and willingness, not in isolation). Additionally, we plan to introduce a **“Trust Decay Amnesty”** period – essentially encouraging members with low rep to engage in specific trust-building activities (like supervised roles) to rehabilitate their standing. Another development is linking the Trust Graph to the **Gear Swap/Trade system** we are piloting – members with higher trust might be able to borrow gear or participate in
