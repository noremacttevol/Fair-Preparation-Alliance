**Why it was created (problem it solves):** Many members have emergency plans, but **untested plans can give a false sense of security**. Short of experiencing a disaster, how can you know if your preparations are truly adequate? Traditionally, one might ask peers to review plans or run limited drills – but human feedback can be slow or miss certain angles. The FPAi Critique Engine was created to **solve the gap in personalized, rigorous plan evaluation**. It leverages AI’s ability to process vast data (historical disaster outcomes, logistics, human behavior) to find vulnerabilities that a person might overlook. This way, members get a **personalized “stress test”** of their plans without the real-life catastrophe. It encourages iterative improvement, ensuring plans aren’t just theoretical. _Simulated crisis scenarios can identify weaknesses in current emergency plans and recommend improvements for future responses ([AI in Emergency Management: Uses & Challenges | SafetyCulture](https://safetyculture.com/topics/emergency-management/ai-in-emergency-management/#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20achieve,for%20improvement%20for%20future%20responses)), and that’s exactly what this tool provides to each member._
