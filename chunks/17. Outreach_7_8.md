- **Laminated Micro-Guides in the Field:** One of the unique outreach tools FPA prepared are **laminated micro-guides** – small, waterproof cards or pamphlets with essential instructions (first aid steps, how to build a field toilet, purify water, basic radio how-to, etc.). We distributed these widely in the community _before_ the event (in welcome packets, at fairs, in mailers). During the crisis, these become invaluable analog resources. People can literally pull a card from their wallet or emergency kit and follow life-saving instructions without needing any phone or internet. Part of our during-event outreach may simply be reminding people via radio or loudspeaker: “_Refer to page 3 of your Emergency Micro-Guide for how to safely treat water now that the mains are contaminated._” If folks have lost theirs, our squads carry extra copies to give out on the spot. These micro-guides ensure that even if all else fails, the knowledge is _physically present_ among the populace.
