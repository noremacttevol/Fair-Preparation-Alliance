Conflicts are expected. This tree shows how they are resolved clearly and fairly:  
1. **1-on-1 Discussion** – Encourage both members to resolve privately. Use a peer mediator if needed.  
2. **Squad Review** – Squad votes on the issue. Anonymous comments are allowed. Vote is logged.  
3. **Regional Panel** – At least one outside squad lead must sit on this panel to prevent bias.  
4. **National Ethics Call** – For violations involving doctrine, high-level corruption, or system sabotage.  
**Failsafe:** If any stage fails to take action within **7 days**, any member may activate the [[Trust Firewall System]] — a decentralized auto-audit that forces the issue to be reviewed by a wider oversight group.
