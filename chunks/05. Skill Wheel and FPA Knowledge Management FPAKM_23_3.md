- **FPA Dictionary:** The [[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]] is our authoritative source for terminology within the Alliance. As the Skill Wheel system introduces new terms and concepts (and repurposes some existing ones in specific ways), we will update the dictionary accordingly. For example, terms like “Skill Wheel,” “Preparedness Level,” “Survivability Score,” “FPAi,” “Outernet Sync,” etc., will have clear definitions in the dictionary. This ensures everyone speaks the same language. When a new member hears about the Skill Wheel or sees an acronym like FPAKM, they can refer to the dictionary and get a straightforward explanation. We are also aligning with the dictionary’s existing entries: if the dictionary defines certain skill levels or roles, we made sure to use the same wording and criteria. Consistent terminology across all training docs, the app, and leadership communications is important. Leaders might start using phrases like “Our squad’s average wheel is 55%, let’s focus on first aid and navigation to bring that up.” Thanks to the dictionary and training, all members will understand that jargon. Maintaining the dictionary entries will be an ongoing task especially as the system evolves – but it’s part of our change management process in Phase2 and 3 to update documentation in lockstep with system updates.
