Q5: How does FPA ensure members follow ethics (fairness, trust)?
A: FPA enforces its ethical standards primarily through the culture set by the Trust Doctrine and peer accountability. When someone joins FPA, they’re introduced to the alliance’s core values – fairness, trust, honesty, and mutual aid – and they’re expected to live by them. There isn’t a formal “ethics police,” but if a member acts against these principles (say they try to scam others, hoard community resources, or break confidentiality), other members and local leaders will call it out. Often issues are handled through direct conversation and correction: reminding the person of the pledge they made, and giving them a chance to fix their behavior. In cases of serious or repeated breaches of trust, FPA won’t hesitate to remove that person from the alliance. Essentially, it’s self-policing: everyone in FPA has a stake in keeping the community trustworthy, so unethical behavior is not tolerated. Peer pressure and a clear code (the Trust Doctrine) maintain the standard that FPA is a fair, reliable group – one bad apple doesn’t get to spoil it for everyone. [#Intermediate] [#Governance]
