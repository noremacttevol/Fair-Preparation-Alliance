**Objective:** Prepare the member for leadership by developing specialized expertise and mentorship abilities.  
Phase III is about depth and leadership grooming:  
- **Specialist Roles:** By this stage, members often choose or are assigned a specialty that benefits the FPA. For example, one might become a **Tech Specialist** (maintaining and teaching about the app and comms gear), another a **Medic**, another a **Logistics/Quartermaster** (managing supplies and gear vetting for the squad), etc. They undergo intensive training or even external certification in that specialty as needed. The Dictionary’s definition of **“gear vetting”** becomes practical here – e.g., a Phase III quartermaster might spearhead testing new gear for their squad and feeding results to the wider org.  
- **Leadership Skills:** Phase III members start taking on secondary leadership roles. They might serve as deputy squad leader, or lead a sub-team during a drill. They learn how to plan operations (with the help of AI and “Test My Plan”, but now they are the one inputting and adjusting the plan), how to brief a team, and how to make decisions on the fly. The Compass Guide’s leadership SOPs (e.g., how to run a debrief, how to resolve conflicts in a team) are now part of their remit.
