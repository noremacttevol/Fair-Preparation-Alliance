- **Alliance Council (National):** At the top, the FPA has a central leadership council composed of the highest-ranked members (E-8s and E-9s, typically founders and proven leaders). The **Alliance Council** sets overall strategy, establishes standards (like this Compass Guide, training curricula, and certification requirements), and handles coordination between regions. They don’t micromanage individual squads, but they provide the playbook and support that keep all the local units moving in the same direction. The Council also oversees national initiatives – e.g. securing partnerships, approving major policy changes, and managing any shared resources that span regions. Think of them as the steering committee ensuring the alliance stays true to its mission and grows effectively.  
This tiered structure – **squad → region → council** – allows information and resources to flow efficiently. Local squads handle immediate issues and report needs up to their region; regions allocate support or escalate big issues to the council. The council disseminates guidance and resources down to regions, which then adapt them to local squads. We maintain **local autonomy** (because a small town’s needs in a wildfire differ from a city’s needs in a blackout) while still having a unified alliance-wide game plan. No member is an island: if your squad struggles, the wider FPA has your back; and if the FPA sets a protocol, it’s there to help your squad succeed.
