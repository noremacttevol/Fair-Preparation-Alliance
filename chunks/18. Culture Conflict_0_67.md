Peer Accountability Training: We recognized earlier that holding a peer accountable can be uncomfortable. To mitigate this, FPA provides training and tools, like simple scripts for difficult conversations or even a buddy system where two peers team up to practice calling out issues with each other in a safe way. We encourage a culture of no silent bystanders – if you see something wrong (be it a teammate slacking off or a rude comment in a meeting), you have an obligation to address it, either directly or through a mediator. And we train how to do that appropriately. Over time, this becomes expected: an employee in FPA should not be surprised if a colleague gently pulls them aside to say, “Hey, I noticed you’ve been missing deadlines; is everything okay? How can we address this?” That would be normal and welcomed, because it shows peers care enough not to let one another slip. This peer policing (in the positive sense) prevents small lapses from turning into big failures or resentment.
