- Conduct a drill where your squad composes a brief “outgoing” emergency request or report. Then actually transmit it via any available HAM operator. If you have handheld HAM radios (HTs) and a nearby repeater, you might do it directly. Or coordinate with an operator who has HF radio to send longer distance. Verify the message was received clearly at the other end (could be another squad or simply a friend in another county acting as endpoint).  
- Also practice receiving and transcribing a message. Perhaps have an outside HAM send in a simulated instruction or situation update to your squad. Your members should practice copying it down verbatim. This might highlight the need for someone with good listening English skills or familiarity with phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, etc. for clarity).  
- Incorporate HAM comms into your wider plan: know which scenarios you’d activate the HAM relay (likely only in large-scale, communications-down disasters). Determine who will be tasked to engage with the amateur radio network and ensure the rest of the squad knows to feed that person the info to send. Essentially, fold the HAM option into ICS as a unit under “Communications” perhaps.
