Regular Drills & Exercises: Planning and executing drills is the bread and butter of this team. They ensure every squad and region participates in regular exercises. Some examples include:
Comms Drills: On a surprise date, the 7.200MHz frequency might broadcast a coded message and every member must respond via radio or app within a time window, simulating an emergency recall.
Bug-Out Drills: Members get a sudden alert “Time to bug out – chemical spill scenario in your area.” They practice grabbing go-bags and meeting at a rally point in real time. Readiness evaluators observe: how fast did people mobilize? Did they bring the right gear?
Field Training Exercises (FTX): Multi-day scenario simulations, like an entire region practicing a post-earthquake response: setting up base camps, establishing comms, performing search and rescue, etc. Drills are as realistic as safely possible – sometimes we involve volunteer “actors” or dummies as victims, or inject surprise events (simulated looters, equipment failure) to test adaptability.
Tabletop Exercises: For leaders, they conduct war-game-style discussions. A scenario is presented and officers/squad leaders walk through their decisions and coordination steps. Often these are enhanced by our AI simulation tools from Tech & App Dev for added realism.
