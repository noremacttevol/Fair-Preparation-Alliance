- Pets: Gear for pets is often included here as well – a leash, pet carrier, collapsible bowls, pet food supply, copies of vaccination records, and pet medications. Also sanitation (waste bags, litter for cats). FPA encourages pet owners to practice evacuating with their pets and ensure they have muzzles if needed (even friendly pets can panic).  
- Emotional Comfort: For those with anxiety or conditions exacerbated by stress, having comforting items (favorite blanket, fidget device, spiritual text) is recognized as legitimate gear too.
FPA’s inclusive approach in gear prep means no member is left struggling because the standard kit list didn’t cover their condition. They maintain checklists for various scenarios (pregnancy, chronic illness, infants) so families can customize effectively. By planning for special needs, the Alliance ensures that everyone – young, old, or with health challenges – has the necessary supplies to stay safe and well during emergencies, and that caregivers have the tools to support them under duress. This upholds the “fair” in Fair Preparation: preparedness for all, not just the most able-bodied.
