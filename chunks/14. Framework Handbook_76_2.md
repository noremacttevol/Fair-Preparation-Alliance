|**Level 3**|**Squad Leader or Specialist** (Advanced readiness)|**Focus:** Leadership and/or specialized expertise, plus long-term resilience. **Requirements:** In addition to Level 2 skills, develop a specialization _or_ take on a leadership role. Specialization could be medical (EMT certification or advanced wilderness first aid), communications (advanced radio operations, tech networking), logistics (supply chain management, amateur radio data networking, etc.), security (advanced CERT or self-defense training), or engineering (e.g., electrician, mechanic skills for infrastructure). Alternatively, stepping up as a Squad Leader also fulfills this level, as it requires leadership training (FPA’s squad leader course on incident management, people management, and advanced SOP knowledge). Prepare for long-duration disruptions at home (1+ month of food/water, alternative energy like solar or generator, and perhaps community networking like knowing neighbors with key resources). **Capabilities:** Level 3 members are the backbone of FPA’s advanced operations. A Squad Leader can coordinate a team through complex missions, and a Specialist can independently handle their technical domain during crises. They can train Level 1 and 2 members in their field. They’re capable of keeping their household and squad functional through extended crises (several months, potentially by rotating with other support). Many Level 3s are involved in mentoring others or spearheading projects like
