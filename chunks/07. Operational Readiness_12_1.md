- **[[Offline-First Resilience System]]** – The overarching strategy that underpins all offline mirrors and backups. The readiness drills and offline kit practices in this doctrine are a direct application of the offline-first principles, validating that we can function without cloud support. This system double-checks that our “plan B” (and C) actually works in practice.  
- **[[FPA ETC/FPA/FPA Core Concepts/FPA Dictionary/FPA Dictionary]]** – The central glossary of FPA terminology and protocols. All the terms like ORP phases, Comm Pulse Check, OpCheck, etc., are defined consistently in the dictionary. This ensures that when different squads or AI tools refer to a term, everyone interprets it the same way. It’s a subtle but crucial part of keeping the whole system aligned.  
By design, improvements or changes in one document (say, the Compass Guide or Trust Doctrine) propagate into the Operational Readiness Doctrine through these links, keeping everything synchronized and up-to-date in the Mk1Mod3 ecosystem.
