5. **Complete “Day Zero Basics” training:** Every new member must go through the FPA “Day Zero Basics” orientation. This is a short training module (online video or in-person workshop) that covers the absolute fundamentals: how to respond in the first 24 hours of a crisis. It includes: emergency communications 101, the Rule of 3’s (air, shelter, water, food priorities), basic OPSEC dos and don’ts, and immediate first aid (like how to stop bleeding). **Complete this training and pass the quick quiz.** It ensures that if something bad happened _tomorrow_, you wouldn’t be totally lost. If you’re unsure how to access this training, ask your squad lead – they might even run a quick group session. This step is required to advance beyond the newbie rank (E-1). It’s literally the knowledge to get you through “Day Zero” of any event, hence the name.
