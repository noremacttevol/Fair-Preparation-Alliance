- If in-person every time is hard, mix it up: perhaps three months of short in-person meetings, then one virtual or conference call to catch up those who missed. Or alternate formal meetings with informal gatherings (like a barbecue that doubles as a planning chat). The key is keeping the connection alive.  
- Create a simple agenda template to ensure meetings are efficient: e.g., **Old Business** (updates on tasks from last time), **Training** (15-min skill refresher or guest speaker), **Upcoming Events/Drills**, **Needs & Issues**, and a quick **roundtable** for any member to speak. End with action item recap (who is doing what).  
- Keep minutes or at least notes of decisions and distribute them (transparency!). This way absent members stay in the loop and there’s accountability for tasks. Even just an email summary is fine.  
- Use meetings to rotate responsibilities: have different members lead the training segment or chair the meeting occasionally. This aligns with empowerment – everyone gets a turn to guide the group. It also avoids dependence on one organizer.
