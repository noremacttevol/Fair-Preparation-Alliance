**Early Squad-to-Squad Communication Links:** The moment a potential crisis is detected, squads should light up their inter-squad communication channels. In practice, this means if a disaster (or serious threat) seems imminent or has just occurred, squad leaders or comms officers reach out to neighboring squad leaders via any available means (HAM radio, phone if still up, runner if needed) _before_ worrying about contacting a distant HQ. This early horizontal linking ensures no squad thinks it’s been left alone. It also allows rapid sharing of on-ground intel: “Do you have power?” “Is the highway bridge intact on your side?” “Are you receiving any broadcast on frequency X?” This peer-to-peer contact establishes a **local net** that can function autonomously if needed. We encourage squads in the same area (for example, within a 20-mile region) to have a predetermined simplex frequency or chat channel to meet on when things go bad. They practice this in drills: e.g., two neighborhoods’ teams plan that if sirens go off or an earthquake hits, they will all switch their radios to channel Z and check in with each other after ensuring their own families are safe. The **Trust Doctrine** underpins this – squads must trust each other enough to communicate openly and render mutual aid, and that trust is built in peacetime by regular get-togethers and joint exercises.
