In addition to what members keep at home or carry, FPA often sets up caches: hidden or secured stashes of supplies along evacuation routes or at strategic locations. Gear related to caches includes:  
- Buried Cache Containers: PVC pipes with sealed ends, or metal ammo cans and buckets with gasket lids – chosen for durability and waterproofing. These hold reserve supplies and are buried or concealed (marked subtly or recorded via GPS).  
- Storage Drums: Larger 55-gallon drums or totes at safe houses containing bulk supplies (food, water, fuel). Not exactly hidden, but pre-positioned at known rendezvous points (like a member’s farm outside the city).  
- Geocache-style Microkits: Tiny waterproof capsules or boxes containing emergency info, copies of documents, a flash drive of the vault, maybe some cash or a radio frequency list – tucked in safe deposit boxes or in-wall hides as backups.  
- Dummy Caches: Sometimes a decoy stash is set with some basic supplies to mislead potential raiders away from the main cache.  
- Locks and Camouflage: Caches might be secured with combination locks (whose code is known to members) or disguised to look mundane (a false rock, or a cache inside an old piece of machinery on a property).
