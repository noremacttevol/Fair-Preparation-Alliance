Q25: What is CERT and how does it relate to prepping?
A: CERT stands for Community Emergency Response Team. It’s a program that trains ordinary citizens in basic disaster response skills so they can assist their community and first responders during emergencies. CERT training (often offered by your local fire department or emergency management office) covers things like basic firefighting (how to use an extinguisher), light search and rescue, simple medical triage and first aid, and team organization. The idea is that after a disaster, professional responders might be overwhelmed or delayed, so CERT volunteers can step in to help their neighbors – checking on homes, putting out small fires, treating minor injuries, and organizing survivors – until official help arrives. For preppers, CERT is a great way to get free training and to become an asset to your community in a crisis. [#Beginner] [#Training]
