In practice, FPA sometimes runs exercises labeled by phase: a “Phase 3 weekend” where everyone assumes no grid and only uses what they’d have in that scenario – cooking on fires, communicating by radio only, etc. This helps highlight gear gaps and behavioral adjustments. By aligning gear strategy with phases, FPA ensures members maximize the usefulness of their equipment throughout the unfolding of a crisis, neither underutilizing available resources in early stages nor over-relying on things that won’t work in the worst case.
