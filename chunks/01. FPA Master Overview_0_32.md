Offline-First Infrastructure: A major focus of Tech & App Dev is designing resilient systems that degrade gracefully. They assume connectivity will fail and build for that. For instance, they set up a content distribution scheme where whenever any member’s phone goes online, it pulls the latest data (updated SOPs, intel reports, etc.) and caches it. That phone can then share data with nearby phones via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct. In effect, every member’s device becomes part of a peer-to-peer mesh when central networks are down. The tech team rigorously tests scenarios: “What if an entire region is cut off from the internet?” They have solutions like portable servers (e.g. a Raspberry Pi-based local FPA hub that regional leads keep) which can sync via radio or satellite occasionally and act as a bulletin board over a local Wi-Fi hotspot. They also experiment with LoRa mesh radios, packet radio, and other alt-networks. Their job is to ensure information still flows at the edge, no matter what. Regular outage simulations and drills help them refine these systems.
