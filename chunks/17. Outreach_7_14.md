- On one street, they encounter rumors (“We heard the dam upstream broke!”). The volunteers quickly radio back to their squad lead to verify. The squad lead checks the Outernet feed and hears nothing of a dam; also another member manages to contact a friend in the next town by walkie-talkie who confirms the dam is intact. Within minutes, the team can confidently tell residents “That rumor is false – the dam is _not_ broken. Stay calm and focus on the official guidance. We will update you if anything changes.” In doing so, they possibly prevented a panicked evacuation in the wrong direction.  
- By combining tech and analog human effort, FPA’s outreach in this scenario likely saved lives and certainly provided comfort. All of this only works because of the **systems and training established beforehand**.
