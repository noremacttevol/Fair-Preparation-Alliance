Training & SHTF Manual: Core skills are drilled manually. Members study and carry the SHTF Manual (our “in case of emergency, break glass” guide). Through regular hands-on training, we build competency in basic first aid, land navigation without GPS, small-unit tactics for community defense, and operating in contested environments where resources are scarce and danger is real. Nothing is taken for granted – we practice everything as if the grid is down and help isn’t coming. Every new recruit goes through a no-frills onboarding and training period to instill these fundamentals. (The manual and training system are described in the [[SHTF Manual & Skills Training System]]; see also the design of our physical/digital SHTF-Ready Notebook in the [[SHTF-Ready Notebook (“SHTF Bible”) – Comprehensive Product Design Document]].)  
Squad Formation (Ground-Level Units): We organize members into squads – small, tight-knit teams, typically 8–12 members who live in proximity, with an elected squad leader. This squad logic ensures that even at the smallest unit level there’s leadership, accountability, and mutual support. Squads train together, maintain local caches of supplies, and form the first line of mutual aid in an emergency. Everyone knows their squad mates by name – these are the people who will have your back when things go wrong.
