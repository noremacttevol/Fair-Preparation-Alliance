is pulling out of certain areas, FPA infers those areas will be lawless and maybe to avoid them. If weather reports show incoming heavy rain after a quake, they prepare for landslides or mud. The intelligence coordinator might brief the group at set times (like at evening gatherings: “Here’s what we know today”). They also use this intel to update their plan – maybe delaying a move by a day because intel shows traffic jams, or accelerating it because a situation is deteriorating. Maintaining Secrecy: While gathering info, FPA is careful when sharing outside the group. Members might talk on ham radio nets, but they won’t reveal critical internal info during those exchanges. They’ll mostly collect data and keep any sensitive commentary to closed channels. On the Realnet or internal comms, they emphasize encryption if possible so their analysis of intel (which might mention their plans) isn’t intercepted. Intel Sharing with Allies: If FPA has allied groups or friendly neighbors, they might share some intelligence with them to help the wider community (for example, informing a neighboring community network that a river’s dam upstream broke, so they can evacuate). This is done when it doesn’t compromise FPA’s position. Conversely, they welcome intel from others – e.g., a friendly police officer member might feed them extra info off-duty, or a utility worker friend could whisper where power will be restored first. FPA values these human intel sources highly. Avoiding Rumors: With
