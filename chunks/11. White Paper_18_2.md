- Assign liaison roles: perhaps each regional relay squad designates one member as the “Outernet Liaison” who is responsible for checking the incoming satellite feed and injecting relevant items into the radio net discussions. Conversely, Content Team members might monitor national HAM frequencies or get a daily summary from relay leads so they know what grassroots chatter needs wider dissemination.  
- Set up a routine: at each scheduled regional radio net (say nightly), include a brief segment where the latest Outernet bulletin is read aloud or summarized. This habit ensures even members without receivers still benefit from the content.  
- Similarly, when a major incident is reported via HAM, use a standard format to forward it to Content Team (maybe an email or a low-bandwidth form when internet is up, or even include it in the Outernet uplink via a back channel if internet is down on their side). Ensure Content Team has listening watch on a national emergency HAM frequency as backup.  
- Cross-train operators: have radio folks learn basics of the Outernet system and vice versa. For instance, a relay operator should know how to plug in the satellite receiver and fetch a file, while a Content Team member should have a radio or at least an online SDR to listen into key channels.
