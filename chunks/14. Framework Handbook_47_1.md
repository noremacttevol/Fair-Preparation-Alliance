- **Training and Drills:** The app hosts training modules (videos, quizzes, interactive guides), which members use to progress through the Operational Readiness levels (Chapter 6). It keeps track of courses completed, certifications (like first aid, ham license), and upcoming training events in your area. It can also simulate scenarios for practice – e.g., a “Disaster Simulator” mini-game that throws random challenges and times your responses, which is both educational and a bit fun.  
- **Knowledge Base Access:** Essentially a digital copy of the SHTF Bible is accessible in the app. It’s searchable by keyword or browsable by category. So you can quickly find that water purification chart or steps for treating shock. This is available offline, as the content is stored on the device after initial download.  
- **Dynamic Pricing & Gear Shop:** There’s an integrated marketplace where members can purchase recommended gear or trade items with each other. The dynamic pricing logic (next chapter) is built into this – the app will show you prices adjusted according to the fair pricing model, and any applicable discounts or credits you have. If internet commerce is down, the app can still function in a local trade mode – listing what people have for barter or loan within radio range, for example.
