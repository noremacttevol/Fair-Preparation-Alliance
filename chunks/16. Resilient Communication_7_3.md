- **Multi-Band Radio Use:** Training to operate VHF/UHF handhelds (for local line-of-sight communication) _and_ to understand how to use a mobile/base radio or HF radio (for longer range). They learn to program frequencies, use repeaters (and know the locations of key local repeaters that have backup power), and establish simplex (direct radio-to-radio) contacts at VHF when repeaters are down.  
- **Introduction to PACE Planning:** Phase 2 is where formal PACE plans (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency comm methods) are taught for their team. They learn to develop a squad-level comm plan that includes, for example: _Primary:_ local repeater or phone tree (if up), _Alternate:_ simplex VHF channel or backup repeater, _Contingency:_ HF radio schedule or satellite text (if available), _Emergency:_ runners or pre-set signals ([PACEing a Communications Resilience Plan - Domestic Preparedness](https://www.domesticpreparedness.com/communication-interoperability/paceing-a-communications-resilience-plan#:~:text=,a%20runner)). They practice this plan in exercises. By drilling PACE, they get used to switching methods smoothly when one fails, rather than going into confusion. For instance, an exercise may simulate “your primary radio channel is being jammed – go to alternate,” and the team has to execute that.
