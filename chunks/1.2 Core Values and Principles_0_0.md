FPA is guided by a set of core values that shape its culture and decisions. Fairness is paramount – resources, knowledge, and support are shared equitably among members, fostering a sense of justice and unity. Trust and honesty are foundational; members are expected to act with integrity and keep commitments (reinforced by the [[Trust Doctrine and Trust Building]]). Community and cooperation define the Alliance’s approach, rejecting the lone-wolf mentality in favor of teamwork and mutual aid. Preparedness and proactiveness are key principles – members continuously improve their readiness and help others do the same. Respect and inclusion ensure that members of diverse backgrounds, skills, and viewpoints are valued (see [[Diversity and Inclusion]]). Resilience – both physical and mental – is emphasized, encouraging adaptability and a positive mindset in the face of adversity. These principles are formally outlined in FPA’s charter and inform all policies (from [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] to training programs). By upholding these core values, FPA maintains a strong, cohesive identity and a culture of shared purpose even as it grows. Members frequently refer back to these principles when making decisions, ensuring the Alliance stays true to its founding vision.
