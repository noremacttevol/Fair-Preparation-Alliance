**Narrative Framing:** All content should tell a part of the larger FPA story. The narrative is one of ordinary individuals banding together to do extraordinary things in times of crisis. It emphasizes resilience: “_Out of the chaos, a network of quiet heroes stands ready – you can be one of them._” It emphasizes decentralization: “_When the grid goes down, our spirit stays up – neighbors helping neighbors, armed with knowledge._” And it emphasizes integrity: “_We do what’s right, even when no one’s watching, because that’s who we are._”  
We often use analogies to frame complex systems in relatable terms. For example, describing the FPA network as a **“bucket brigade”** of information: each local group passes vital info to the next, hand-to-hand, if needed, to put out the fires of panic. Or framing our printed guidebooks as **“lanterns”** that stay lit even when the power’s out, guiding people to safety. These narrative devices make the strategy memorable and emotionally resonant.  
All messaging, whether a social media post or a ham-radio broadcast script, should be filtered through these voice principles. Before release, we ask: _Is it truthful? Is it empowering? Does it avoid jargon? Does it prompt constructive action? Does it feel like it came from a trusted friend who’s got their boots on the ground with you?_ If yes, it’s on tone. If not, we rewrite.
