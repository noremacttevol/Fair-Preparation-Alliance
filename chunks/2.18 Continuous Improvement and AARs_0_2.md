revealed that not everyone knew who the deputy leader was when the leader was out, they’ll amend the SOP to clarify chain of command and remind members of it. Recognizing What Worked: Continuous improvement isn’t only about negatives. AARs also highlight what went well, so those practices are reinforced. E.g., “Having a designated person monitor the news was very helpful – we should always assign that role.” Or “Our new [[Realnet (Phase 2 Communication Backbone)]] chat channel proved extremely useful; everyone saw messages promptly.” Celebrating these successes boosts morale and validates training methods. Periodic Performance Reviews: Outside of specific events, FPA might periodically review aspects of readiness. For example, annually a chapter might assess each member’s skill development or state of supplies in a less formal way and identify improvement areas (e.g., “Collectively, we realized not enough of us are proficient with map reading – let’s schedule a workshop”). Adapting to New Threats: The world and threat landscape change, so continuous improvement includes updating plans for new scenarios. If a new technology or threat emerges (say, cyber-attack leading to grid down, or civil unrest patterns they observe in media), they’ll incorporate those into training and plans, often prompted by internal analysis discussions. This agility means FPA’s strategies are not static; they evolve with time. Knowledge Sharing Among Chapters: If one chapter learns a hard lesson, FPA
