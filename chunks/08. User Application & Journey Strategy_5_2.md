- **Trust Doctrine in System Design:** The [[Trust Doctrine]] underpins many system decisions to prevent any breach of faith. One manifestation in the user journey is the **transparent communication** around processes. When the AI filters an application or flags a post, the user is informed in clear, respectful terms, often with the _why_. E.g., “Your application is under review to ensure alignment with our mission – we’ll get back to you in 48 hours” – no black box rejection. Another example: the **audit feed** showing membership fee calculations and where the money cap is ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=%20section%20iv:%20governance%20&,the%20fpa%20live%20audit%20feed-1l001i/)), so users trust that no one is profiteering and the “$100k cap” promise is kept. _“Trust is not a vibe – it’s a system.”_ This means whenever a user interacts with FPA, they encounter structured honesty: clear data policies (consent checkbox explicitly mentioned data use), opt-in for any tracking, and community review of any major change. The **Trust Firewall System (TFS)** sits in the background of the journey; for instance, if an AI suggestion in the onboarding was found to be bad advice, FPA staff would issue a correction to all affected users (with a “patch note”) – treating it like a software bug to fix trust. By practicing this rigorous approach, members see that issues are not swept under the rug, increasing confidence in the platform.
