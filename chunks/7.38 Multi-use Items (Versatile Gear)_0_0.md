FPA loves gear that can serve many purposes, reducing pack weight and increasing capability. Some favorite multi-use items:  
- Bandana or Shemagh: Functions as sun protection, dust mask, bandage, tourniquet, pre-filter for water, signaling flag, improvised bag or cordage, sling, hot pot holder, etc.  
- Duct Tape & Paracord: These are like universal repair and construction materials. Uses are virtually endless: mend gear, make tools, restrain something, build shelter, first aid (splints, blisters), you name it.  
- Trash Bags (Contractor Grade): Can be made into a poncho, water collector, ground cloth, makeshift pack, or for waterproofing gear. Also essential for sanitation (to line toilets or carry waste).  
- Tarps: As mentioned before â€“ not just shelter, but rain catchment, wrap for carrying supplies, partition in a room, or even folded as stretcher.  
- Clothing Layers: A wool blanket can be bedding, clothing, shade, or even cut into smaller pieces for insulation in boots or around pipes. Similarly, aluminum foil in kits can be used for cooking, signaling, electronics shielding, etc.  
- Pot with Lid: Cook food, boil water, sanitize instruments, carry water, use lid as plate, dig if needed, even use as noise-maker to signal.
