While flexibility exists depending on local circumstances, FPA recommends each squad encompass certain **roles** to ensure all functional areas are covered. One person may fulfill multiple roles if the squad is small, but the responsibilities should be clearly understood. Here are the typical roles in a squad and their primary duties:  
|**Role**|**Primary Responsibilities**|
|---|---|
|**Squad Leader**|Provides overall leadership and coordination. The Squad Leader is responsible for making final decisions during planning and crisis response, based on input from the team. They organize drills, ensure everyone knows their tasks, and act as the point-of-contact to other squads or FPA central coordination. In essence, they keep the team aligned and informed.|
|**Communications Lead**|Manages all communication tools and protocols. This member ensures the squad’s radios, mobile devices, and other communication channels are operational. During an incident, they relay messages within the squad and to/from outside contacts (neighboring squads, emergency services, etc.). They monitor emergency frequencies (like weather alerts or ham radio channels) and maintain the squad’s part of the mesh network. The comms lead often has an amateur radio license and training in our offline comms systems.|
