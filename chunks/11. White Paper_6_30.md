- Aim to get as many members certified in CPR and basic first aid as possible. If formal classes aren’t accessible, use the **FPA Compass Guide** or online videos to host an in-squad training night. Use dummy props for CPR practice (even a pillow can simulate compressions) if mannequins aren’t available.  
- Supplement training with building actual kits: after learning, assemble personal first aid kits for each member (these can be small pouches with bandages, disinfectant, etc., often very low-cost). Also assemble a larger community trauma kit for the squad base including tourniquets, burn dressings, etc.  
- Practice medical scenarios during drills (e.g., simulate someone unconscious, have a member perform the steps: “Are you okay? Call 911. Start CPR.” etc.). Familiarity is key to reducing panic in real events.  
- Keep a list of who has up-to-date certifications and when refreshers are needed. Encourage ongoing skill sharpening – maybe a five-minute first-aid tip is shared at each meeting to keep knowledge fresh.
