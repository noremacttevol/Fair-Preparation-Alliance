To make all this concrete, let’s walk through a hypothetical cascading crisis and see how the FPA Mk1Mod3 framework shines in action.  
**Scenario:** It’s late summer in a coastal city. A Category 4 hurricane (**Lucia**) is bearing down, expected to make landfall in 48 hours. The region is also facing a heatwave that’s straining the power grid. There are worries the hurricane’s flooding could cause a leak at a nearby chemical plant. This is a complex, multi-hazard situation – exactly what Mk1Mod3 is built for.
