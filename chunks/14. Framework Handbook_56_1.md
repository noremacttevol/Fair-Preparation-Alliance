**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Mk1Mod3 introduces the **SOP Compass Guide** (Chapter 5) – a comprehensive set of standardized procedures for various emergency situations. Under Mk1Mod2, procedures were more ad hoc or left to each squad’s discretion, which led to inconsistencies. Now, key actions are guided by pre-established SOPs, ensuring everyone is literally on the same page when a crisis hits. Research in disaster management shows that well-formulated and applied SOPs are essential for coordinated action across teams. Our SOP Compass not only lists actions but also uses an easy-to-follow “compass” metaphor to help members navigate decisions during chaos. This upgrade means fewer delays or mistakes – everyone knows their immediate tasks whether it’s a fire, flood, or communications blackout.
