- **Development of Specialized Tools:** Beyond the main app, Tech & App Dev often whips up **specialized software** as needed. If Comms & Outreach needs a CRM-like tool to track outreach efforts, Tech builds it or adapts an open-source solution. If Governance wants an e-voting platform that’s verifiable and secure, Tech creates a custom module for that (maybe using blockchain for auditability of votes). If Readiness & Drills wants a training simulator, Tech collaborates to produce a web app for that. They also likely maintain the **FPA website/portal** where public info is shared and new members join. They ensure the site doesn’t inadvertently leak data and that it stays accessible even under heavy load (like during a national scare when everyone’s trying to join at once).
