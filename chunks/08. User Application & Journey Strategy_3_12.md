- **Community Scaling & Self-Organization:** With more members and squads in Phase2, the platform introduces features to maintain quality and coherence:  
- **Squad Formation & Tools:** The “Start a Squad” function becomes available openly – members can create a new squad, which comes with a starter **Squad Blueprint** (standard operating procedures template, roles roster, etc.). New squad creators might be mentored by regional coordinators (experienced volunteers) to ensure consistency ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=all%20ai%20insights%20printable;%20offline,votes%20remove%20inactive;%20day%20zero-mn31f/)). The app could automatically link a new squad lead with a **Regional Mentor** contact who can guide them. This federated structure begins to form a hierarchy (squad -> region -> national) that will be fully utilized in Phase3.  
- **Content & Training Expansion:** Phase2 likely sees the release of the full digital **SHTF Bible** and training modules via the app. Members get access to a knowledge base for advanced learning (first aid courses, etc.). They can earn badges or certs for completing trainings. The [[Compass Guide]] and [[Trust Doctrine]] are also built into a training or reference section in-app for ongoing culture education.
