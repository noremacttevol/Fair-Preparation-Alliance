**Shielding Gear with Faraday Cages:** The first line of defense is to harden and protect critical equipment _before_ an EMP or coronal mass ejection hits. FPA members are required to store vital communications gear in Faraday cages or bags whenever those devices are not in use. A Faraday enclosure — essentially a continuous conductive shell around the device — will channel destructive electromagnetic currents around the device rather than through it ([EMP Attack Survival: Securing Electronics](https://weloveprepping.com/blog/emp-attack-survival-securing-electronics/#:~:text=The%20ideal%20solution%20is%20to,prevents%20EMPs%20from%20causing%20damage)). Even a simple DIY Faraday cage can be built from a steel trash can or metal filing cabinet, as long as it’s fully lined or sealed with no gaps ([EMP Attack Survival: Securing Electronics](https://weloveprepping.com/blog/emp-attack-survival-securing-electronics/#:~:text=A%20simple%20DIY%20Faraday%20cage,will%20not%20effectively%20block%20EMPs)). (For example, a latching metal garbage can with a tight-fitting lid and metal tape sealing the seams can attenuate an EMP by >99%.) Do **not** rely on mesh alone (small holes can leak EMP energy ([EMP Attack Survival: Securing Electronics](https://weloveprepping.com/blog/emp-attack-survival-securing-electronics/#:~:text=A%20simple%20DIY%20Faraday%20cage,will%20not%20effectively%20block%20EMPs))); use solid metal or double-layered foil as needed.
