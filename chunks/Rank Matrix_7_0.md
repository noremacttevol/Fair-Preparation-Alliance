The FPA rank system is built on fairness and equal access. **No rank, whether Enlisted, Officer, or Prestige, grants special perks or exclusive access to information.** All members, regardless of rank, use the same communication tools, attend the same general training (with advanced options open to all who qualify), and have visibility into the same network resources. Higher rank is viewed as _more responsibility_, not more privilege:  
- **No Secret Knowledge or Tools:** There are no secret manuals or exclusive gear reserved for higher ranks. For example, an E-2 has access to the same emergency plan templates and radio frequencies as an E-10. The difference is that an E-10 has more experience using them. All official documents, standard operating procedures, and training materials are open to all members.  
- **Contribution is Rewarded, Not Power:** Ranks primarily indicate how much a member has contributed to their own preparedness and to the group. For officers, rank indicates the size of the group they’re currently responsible for – not any inherent power over others outside that scope. An officer’s decisions are accountable to those who elected them and to the Alliance’s guidelines.
