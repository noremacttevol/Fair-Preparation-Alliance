_Real-world example:_ When the power grid fails and internet and phone networks collapse, information becomes as vital as food and water. A classic example is after Hurricane Maria (2017) in Puerto Rico: residents were cut off from news for days. In one town, an amateur radio operator with a battery-powered setup became the sole source of outside info, relaying messages to and from San Juan. Today, technology offers new options: devices like **Outernet** receivers can pull down data from satellites without needing ground internet. Picture this: a member in a remote area has an Outernet mini-receiver (about the size of a book) – after a cyber-attack takes out the grid, she still receives essential news and FPA updates broadcast via satellite, all on a small battery-powered device. Meanwhile, her neighbor who didn’t invest in such backup is completely in the dark. Another example: during a regional blackout, one FPA family used a hand-crank radio to get NOAA weather alerts about an incoming storm, buying them critical preparation time. The milestone here is to ensure every member has **two-way or one-way emergency communication means beyond standard internet/phone**: at least one method to **receive information** (like a NOAA radio or Outernet feed) and one method to **send out a distress call** (like HAM radio or even a whistle/signal mirror as last resort). And for high-priority members in the network, we aim to pilot advanced tech like satellite messengers or
