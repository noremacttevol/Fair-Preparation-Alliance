3. **Feedback Report & Score:** After analysis, FPAi gives you a detailed report on your plan ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=3.%20,also%20give%20an%20overall%20preparedness/)). It highlights **strengths** – things you’ve done well – and **weaknesses** – areas that need improvement ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=3.%20,also%20give%20an%20overall%20preparedness/)). Each weakness comes with a specific recommendation on how to fix it. For instance, the report might say: _“Water supply (3 days) is insufficient for 4 people – consider storing at least 12 more gallons”_ or _“No alternative communication listed – add a backup like a HAM radio or FRS walkie-talkies”_ ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=3.%20,overall%20preparedness%20score%20or%20rating/)). It doesn’t just criticize; it tells you exactly what action to take. The report may also include an overall preparedness **score or rating** to sum up your plan’s effectiveness ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=3.%20,overall%20preparedness%20score%20or%20rating/)). This scoring lets you track your progress over time. All this feedback is given in FPA’s signature direct style – clear and factual. If your plan has a serious flaw, FPAi will point it out plainly, _but always in a helpful way with a solution attached_. Many members find this honesty refreshing
