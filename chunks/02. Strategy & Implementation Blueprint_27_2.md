- **Privacy in Logs:** While transparency is key, we handle personal or sensitive info with care. If a log entry involves personal data (like a medical detail or personal dispute), the publicly accessible log might redact the names or details, replacing them with anonymized tokens. The Tribunal might have access to the full detail for accountability, but average members don’t need to see, for example, someone’s medical condition to know that “an incident was handled per protocol”. We strike a balance: be open, but not violate privacy without cause. We state these rules clearly so it doesn’t appear that something was hidden arbitrarily – members know exactly what kinds of info might be withheld and why (and even that withholding is logged: e.g., “Details of this entry are confidential due to personal privacy – approved by Tribunal case #X”).  
- **Cultural Aspect:** Over time, we build a culture where logging is second nature. Members come to expect that if it’s not logged, it “didn’t happen” in terms of organizational memory. This actually incentivizes people to document their efforts (which helps when recalling lessons learned) and to behave as if the whole community is watching – which for us is a feature, not a bug, since it promotes acting with integrity. Conversely, if leadership ever tried to hide something by not logging it, members would find that very suspicious. Therefore, the safest route for everyone is to be honest and put it on the record.
