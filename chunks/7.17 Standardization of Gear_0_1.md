people carry. Standardization also aids training; if everyone has a similar water purifier, a single demo covers all. Importantly, they don’t enforce this top-down; rather, through the collective testing and “approved gear list” process, members naturally coalesce around the gear that’s proven to work and is widely accessible. They maintain a pool of spare parts for standardized items (like replacement o-rings for the group’s water filters, or spare tubes for the common radio antennas). There’s also a marking system: standardized gear can be color-coded or labeled so it’s immediately recognizable (for instance, all FPA radios might have an orange sticker). In crisis, this reduces confusion – any member can pick up any kit or tool and use it competently. By standardizing where it counts, FPA increases their logistical efficiency and resilience, ensuring that critical systems are compatible and simplifying the complex puzzle of managing many different items under stress.
