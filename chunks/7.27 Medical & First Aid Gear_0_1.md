- Protective Gear: Nitrile gloves in quantity, N95 masks, eye protection, and apron or gown for infection control. Also red biohazard bags for waste.  
- Reference materials: A first aid manual (like “Where There Is No Doctor” and “Where There Is No Dentist”) kept with the kit as a guide in tough scenarios.
This medical gear, coupled with training, enables FPA members to handle injuries and common illnesses when doctors may not be reachable – from minor cuts to major trauma stabilization. It’s stressed that knowledge of use is as important as the gear itself.
