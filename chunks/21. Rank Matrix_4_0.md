**Ranks E-6 through E-10 are the advanced stage of the core path, emphasizing field readiness, technical proficiency, and leadership.** In these ranks, members prove they can operate under adverse conditions, lead others, and contribute back to the Alliance’s collective knowledge. Key milestones for E-6 to E-10 include:  
- **E-6 (Specialist):** Prove your ability to function during a crisis by **passing a “blackout” field scenario.** You must successfully complete a **24-hour off-grid simulation** – essentially, live through a full day (and night) with no external power, simulating a widespread blackout or EMP event. During this period, you demonstrate use of backup power or off-grid skills, and crucially, **maintain communications in the dark** (using your radio on battery/solar power through the night). This shows you can apply your skills in a realistic disaster scenario. _(AP: points for completing the scenario and documenting your experience; extra points if you assist others or coordinate with a team during the drill.)_
