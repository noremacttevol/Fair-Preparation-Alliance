send as well as receive. For example, a member could post a request for help on the Realnet bulletin board, and others on the mesh will see it and respond, all without any ISP. It is inherently survivable because there’s no central point of failure; if one node goes down, the data routes via others, and if parts of the mesh fragment, each fragment can still operate independently. FPA actively works on Realnet by setting up experimental meshes in neighborhoods, often piggybacking on existing devices (like flashing custom firmware on old routers or using phones with Wi-Fi direct in a mesh app). Realnet is the Alliance’s answer to “how do we keep everyone connected when the Internet is a memory?” – a homemade network that lives as long as the community does.
