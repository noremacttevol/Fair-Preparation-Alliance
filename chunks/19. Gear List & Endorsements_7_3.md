It prevents trolls or outside agents from disrupting the process, since membership can be revoked if someone violates trust. Moreover, members often share sensitive preparedness strategies tied to gear (like how they integrate a tool into their home safety plan), which they are more comfortable sharing in a private setting. Protecting member discussions and data encourages honest and detailed input, which ultimately benefits the quality of our endorsements.
