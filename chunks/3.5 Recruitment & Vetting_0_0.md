New members are brought into FPA through a careful recruitment and vetting process designed to maintain group cohesion and trust. Potential members often come by referral or via local community preparedness events. The vetting process may include interviews or background checks to ensure the individual shares the Allianceâ€™s values of fairness and cooperation. The Alliance is open to all skill levels, but it looks for those willing to learn, share, and contribute rather than just consume resources. Clear expectations are set during recruitment: new members understand the code of conduct, the commitment to participate in training, and the culture of mutual aid from the outset.
