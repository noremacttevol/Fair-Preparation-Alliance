- _Contingency Plan:_ If certain skills are too advanced to fully cross-train (not everyone will become a licensed HAM operator easily, for instance, or not everyone can drive a big truck), ensure at minimum theoretical knowledge is spread (“If I’m not here, here’s how you turn on the radio and call channel X for help”). Write cheat sheets for complex tasks and keep them with the equipment – that at least gives a fighting chance for an untrained member to use it under guidance. If someone resists sharing knowledge (job protection mentality), stress that the squad’s survival could depend on anyone doing it. In the end, cross-training is about survival and effectiveness, not stepping on toes.

- _Real-World Example:_ A coastal squad partnered with the local Red Cross chapter to co-host a “Prepareathon” fair. This connection meant that during a subsequent apartment fire, Red Cross knew exactly who the squad was and collaborated smoothly, handing off certain tasks (the squad managed a neighborhood donation drop-off point while Red Cross handled victim sheltering). Another squad befriended a pharmacy owner who agreed to stock extra emergency medical supplies and even let the squad store a cache of ice packs and insulin in their backroom fridge for power outage scenarios. When a blackout happened, that pharmacy became a community lifeline with the squad’s help.
