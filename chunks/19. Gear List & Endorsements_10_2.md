- **Sponsorship Token System (Under Consideration):** The Alliance is exploring a **token-based sponsorship model** as a futuristic approach to transparency. In concept, this would involve a digital token (possibly blockchain-based for an immutable record) that represents a sponsorship credit. Vendors or benefactors who want to support FPA’s mission could purchase these tokens, and those tokens would then be used in specific, controlled ways – for example, funding a particular gear test cycle or sponsoring an educational workshop. Each token’s usage and origin would be publicly trackable, ensuring that money flows are transparent. The tokens would _not_ be tied to any particular product endorsement and would not be transferable into influence. Think of it as a public tip jar where all tips are accounted for. This system is still just an idea; we have a small team researching feasibility and potential pitfalls (such as ensuring it doesn’t become a backdoor for influence). If it moves forward, it will be trialed on something low-stakes first (like funding the printing of field card sets for community centers) before any wider use. (Experimental Proposal – not active at this time.)
