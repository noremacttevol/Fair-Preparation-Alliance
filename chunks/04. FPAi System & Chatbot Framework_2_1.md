2. **AI Analysis:** Once submitted, the AI analyzes your plan against FPA’s knowledge base and checklists ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=2.xn--%20,if%20scenarios%20and%20find%20gaps-dx1x/)). It cross-references each element with proven guidelines from FPA manuals. For example, it will check if you have enough water per person (using FPA’s recommended formulas), if your first aid kit meets the standard, if your communication plan has backups (like a HAM radio in case cell service fails), and whether you’ve addressed OPSEC (operational security) and other often-overlooked aspects ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=2.xn--%20,if%20scenarios%20and%20find%20gaps-dx1x/)). Essentially, FPAi runs your plan through **expert criteria** and even simulates “what if” scenarios to see where things might go wrong ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-8chavoigzfxzbru5bsau7m%23:~:text=your%20communication%20plan%20has%20backups,if%20scenarios%20and%20find%20gaps-fb78e/)). This might involve dozens of little checks – from food calories per day, to fuel for generators, to having meeting points for your family – all done instantly by the AI.
