- **Member Access (Alliance Members-Only):** FPA members, once logged in, gain full access to gear information. This includes comprehensive test results, the full text of AI summary reports, raw data from field tests, lengthy discussions or debates that took place among members, and any multimedia (videos, photos from testing). Members can also access the **transparent logs** such as the Vendor Transparency Log and Price Monitoring Log to see behind-the-scenes interactions and updates. In short, members get the complete picture of each gear’s journey through our process. Additionally, members have access to **in-progress evaluations** – they can see which items are currently being tested or voted on (though these are marked clearly as “Pending Endorsement – not yet approved” to avoid confusion). We also provide members with the tools to participate: forms to submit their own gear tips, forums to comment on reports, and voting mechanisms when polls are open. _Rationale:_ Full disclosure to members fosters a culture of trust and collective effort. When you join FPA, you’re not just getting a “consumer report;” you’re joining a **secure collaboration space**. By keeping this within membership, we ensure participants are accountable (every member agrees to our code of conduct and values). It prevents trolls or outside agents from disrupting the process, since membership can be revoked if someone violates trust. Moreover, members often share sensitive preparedness strategies tied
