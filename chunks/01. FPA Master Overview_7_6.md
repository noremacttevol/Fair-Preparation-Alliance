- **Quality Control & After-Action Reviews:** After every major event or drill, Core Coordination leads the **after-action review (AAR)** process. They gather reports from all involved and analyze: What went well? What failed? They keep a no-blame, frank tone – brutally honest about shortcomings because lives are at stake. If communications failed in a region during a storm, they’ll call it out and then direct Tech or Comms to fix the gap. If a squad performed exceptionally, they’ll highlight those best practices and propagate them Alliance-wide. Core keeps institutional memory: a database of lessons learned that constantly updates our SOPs and training curricula. They ensure **continuous improvement** – the Alliance today must be better than yesterday, always.  
- **Liaison & External Coordination:** Core Coordination is also the focal point for coordinating with any external entities at an operational level. For instance, if we decide to work with a local government’s emergency management for a hurricane response, Core appoints a liaison officer to plug into their command post. Or if the Red Cross asks for volunteer support, Core evals if it fits our mission then coordinates sending some of our teams under proper agreements. They ensure we **integrate smoothly with outsiders when beneficial** without compromising our autonomy or principles. All such partnerships are weighed carefully: will this help our members and mission? If yes, coordinate; if no, politely decline.
