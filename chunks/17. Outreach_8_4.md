- **Local Replication & Expansion:** Post-event is ironically the best time to recruit and expand preparedness efforts, because the need is painfully clear to everyone. Many who previously were complacent may now be eager to prepare. FPA seizes this window by helping the affected community formalize or grow their local preparedness infrastructure _for the future_. If a town with no prior FPA presence was hit and we came in to assist via an adjacent squad, we’ll now propose, “Let’s start an FPA chapter here officially.” We’ll use the momentum and the now-willing local leaders to establish new squads. Often this involves leaving behind resources: we may have brought in extra radios or printed manuals as part of relief – instead of taking those back, we gift them to the community’s new preparedness group. We might host a “Lessons Learned and Building Forward” town hall, where we invite everyone (with refreshments, making it a community event) to talk about what happened and how to be better prepared. At that event, we essentially launch the local FPA team with signups. Additionally, for communities that had squads, this is a time to _replicate success_: if a few neighborhoods fared better because of an active FPA program, we will highlight that and encourage neighboring towns to adopt similar models. Essentially, post-event outreach often turns into a mini marketing campaign for FPA’s approach, because now we have a concrete example to point to. The key difference from
