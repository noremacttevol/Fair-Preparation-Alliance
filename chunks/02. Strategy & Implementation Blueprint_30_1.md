- **Open Forums and Retrospectives:** Periodically (say annually or bi-annually), we hold open forums – either in person at a big meetup or virtually across the network – where members discuss big-picture questions. This could be about strategic direction (“Should FPA extend its mission to neighboring communities actively or focus inward?”) or about major system changes (“Is it time to upgrade our AI model to a new architecture?”). These forums allow free exchange and often spark the ideas that lead to major improvements. They are effectively crowdsourced brainstorming and accountability sessions. All members can hear others’ views, bridging the gap between leadership and the front lines.
