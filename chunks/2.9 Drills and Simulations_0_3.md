Joint Drills with Allies: In some cases, FPA might coordinate a drill with a friendly neighboring prepper group or CERT team (keeping OPSEC, the scenario is usually generic). For example, a citywide “grid-down weekend” where multiple groups attempt to operate without power or communications and then meet for a debrief. This can broaden experience and reveal how FPA might interface with non-members in a real event.  
During all drills, realism vs safety is balanced. Members know it’s a drill (unless leadership announces a surprise, but even then, safe words or channels exist to avoid panic). Safety protocols are observed (no live firearms use in drills beyond normal range practice, no actual dangerous fire starting except in controlled environment, etc.). The aim is to stretch comfort zones but not to endanger anyone.  
After each simulation, thorough debriefs are held. Members discuss what went well and what failed. These debrief notes are recorded (contributing to [[Continuous Improvement and AARs]]). For instance, a drill might reveal that not everyone had the updated radio frequency list, prompting an action item to print and distribute wallet cards with frequencies. Or it could show that a particular family struggled because their children weren’t briefed on the plan, highlighting a need for more family-inclusive training (leading to something like a family preparedness workshop).
