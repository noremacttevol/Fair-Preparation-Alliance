FPA’s communication approach is dynamic, adjusting to whatever infrastructure remains operable. At any point in a crisis, members assess: what’s up, what’s down? For example, if cell towers are partially functional, maybe only SMS works but not data – the plan shifts to exploit that (send text blasts for coordination, as mentioned in Phase 2 plans). If power is out but landline phones still work in some places, members will use those old copper lines if they exist. The Alliance has guidelines for various contingencies: “If internet connectivity is intermittent, prioritize sending low-bandwidth messages (no images or large files) and use offline-first apps that queue messages for sending when a signal appears. If power is limited, enforce radio silence except on the hour to conserve batteries ([[4.20 Communication Gear Maintenance]] covers having those extra batteries). If repeaters are down in a ham network, automatically switch to pre-assigned simplex frequencies. This adaptation also covers opportunistic use of any available means—like if someone manages to get access to a functioning Wi-Fi or Starlink terminal, even briefly, they’ll know to send out batch updates or download important info for the group quickly. Conversely, if the infrastructure improves (say power comes back or a temporary cell tower is installed by authorities), FPA will shift back to those more convenient channels, but keep the backups warm. Essentially, at each stage, communications leads are asking:
