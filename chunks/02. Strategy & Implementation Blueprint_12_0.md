**Objective:** Entrust the member with leading a squad or a key organizational function, thereby sustaining FPA’s leadership pipeline.  
Phase IV is where members become leaders and potentially take on roles in FPA’s governance:  
- **Squad Leader:** Most Phase IV members will become a squad leader (taking command of their own squad, or replacing an outgoing leader in their current squad). As a leader, they are responsible for their squad’s readiness, welfare, and performance. They plan drills, coordinate with other squad leads for multi-squad efforts, and serve as the first line of upholding the Trust Doctrine at the squad level (ensuring transparency within the team, resolving minor disputes fairly, etc.).  
- **Platoon/Chapter Leadership:** In areas with multiple squads (say a city or region), Phase IV leaders might form a local council or “platoon” leadership, coordinating several squads. They might rotate responsibilities for larger events or serve as liaisons to the FPA central governance (the Tribunal or central board).
