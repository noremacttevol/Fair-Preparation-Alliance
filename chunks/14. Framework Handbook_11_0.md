Principles mean little without practices to back them up. Mk1Mod3 introduces several practices to build and maintain trust:  
- **Member Vetting:** Trust begins with **who** is allowed into the circle. FPA now has a vetting process for new members. While we welcome anyone interested in genuine community preparedness, we do a basic background check and require references for those seeking leadership positions. This isn’t to be exclusive or gatekeeping; it’s about ensuring new members don’t pose a risk to others (for example, a history of fraud or violence would be disqualifying). Vetting was informal in Mk1Mod2, but now it’s standardized. Our Security teams conduct these checks as part of onboarding.  
- **Trust Orientation:** Every new recruit goes through an orientation that emphasizes the Trust Doctrine. We share real stories (anonymized) of how trust – or lack of it – affected outcomes in past emergencies. This helps newcomers internalize why trust isn’t just a nice-to-have, but a necessity.  
- **Team-Building Drills:** Squads are encouraged to do periodic team-building exercises beyond just survival training. For instance, a squad might do a weekend community service project together. Working side by side in non-crisis situations helps strengthen personal bonds. In Mk1Mod2, training was very task-focused; Mk1Mod3 recognizes that building camaraderie is equally important. A tight-knit team will perform better when things go wrong.
