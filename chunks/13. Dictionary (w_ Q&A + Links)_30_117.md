prewritten instruction known to members. For intelligence gathering, they use shortwave radios to listen to international news if the local comms are blacked out, and scanners to monitor emergency services. If tech-savvy, a few might employ Software Defined Radios (SDR) to scan a wide range of signals or decode things like weather fax or satellite imagery. The alliance probably has a small group focusing on emerging communication tech (drones that can drop notes, hidden Wi-Fi networks, etc.) and figuring how to incorporate that. Of course, they also acknowledge the limits and risks: sat phones need open sky and can be expensive; digital modes require power and sometimes Internet (like for email gateways) unless purely radio; high-tech can fail, so it augments but doesn’t replace simpler methods. Essentially, FPA’s comm strategy is layered: basic voice comms for everyone (walkie-talkies, CB, ham voice), advanced digital and satellite for key links and resilience. By using these advanced tools, they aim for no chapter to be completely isolated and to expedite support, while also feeding crucial info up and down (like getting a satellite weather update and then disseminating it via radio to all local groups). It’s a continuous area of development, especially as new off-grid communication gadgets come to market – FPA tests and adopts what works and what members can afford/handle.
