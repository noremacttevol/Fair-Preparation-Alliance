Officer Track (O-1 and above): In parallel with enlisted ranks, FPA has an officer track for higher leadership positions. While enlisted promotions are mainly earned through points and experience, becoming an officer requires a selection process on top of having sufficient AP. Officers are the strategists and coordinators of large units or programs. For example, a city chapter might be led by an O-1 (equivalent to a Lieutenant), a state by an O-5 (Colonel equivalent), and the national alliance by an O-6 or O-7 (General equivalent). We use civilian-friendly titles (like “Chapter Director” instead of Colonel) in public, but internally the rank indicates hierarchy and authority.  
To become an officer, a member usually must reach at least E-6 or E-7, then be vetted and approved by a board of existing leaders (including other officers and senior enlisted), or occasionally be directly commissioned for special expertise. (E.g., if a seasoned medical doctor or experienced logistician joins FPA and clearly can lead at a high level, we might fast-track them into an officer role with appropriate training).  
Officers still earn AP like anyone else, but their promotions (say, O-1 to O-2, etc.) depend more on fulfilling organizational needs and leadership assessments than just point totals. We don’t want someone to game the system by grinding points if they lack people skills, and end up in an officer role – they must prove they can handle leadership responsibilities in practice.
