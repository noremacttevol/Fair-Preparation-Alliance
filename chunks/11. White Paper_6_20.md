- _Contingency Plan:_ If some community members are suspicious or unwilling (perhaps fearing scams), do not push. You can still quietly keep an eye out for them when times get tough – just without formal agreement. If the squad is too small to cover everyone, prioritize by who has absolutely no one else. In events where squad capacity is overwhelmed, communicate with official responders about any high-priority need cases (fire departments often will act on specific addresses if informed). Always maintain privacy: use initials or codes on your internal list in case it’s lost, and stress to members this info is sensitive. A breach of trust here could alienate the very people you aim to help.

- _Real-World Example:_ A squad in a floodplain neighborhood took an afternoon to walk the area, marking up a printed map with things like: low spots that always fill with water, houses of immobile residents, locations of fire hydrants, propane tanks, and even the nearest hills that could serve as shelter. They also noted assets: a grocery store (potential food source), a school (designated shelter site), and a community center with a backup generator. When heavy rains came and the river swelled, they knew exactly which four blocks to focus on first for evacuation and where to set up a safe rally point on high ground. Their prior mapping shaved critical time off their response.
