Our hope is that as members use the system, they will see the translation of their Skill Wheel improvements into actual field performance. For example, a member might realize, “I handled that emergency so much better than I would have a year ago – and that’s because I followed the learning path to improve my medical and comms skills.” When members connect those dots, they internalize that _the real value lies in the skills_, not the numbers. At that point, the Skill Wheel simply becomes a mirror reflecting their progress and a map pointing to what to do next. It’s not the _object_ of the game, but a guiding tool for the never-ending journey of preparedness. And that is exactly what we want in FPA: a culture where we are always learning and adapting, never for bragging rights, always for the true goal – protecting ourselves and our community.
