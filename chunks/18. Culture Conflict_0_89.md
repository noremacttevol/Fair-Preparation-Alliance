Crisis Protocol for Leadership Failure: In the worst-case scenario – say a significant portion of leadership is implicated in wrongdoing or fails to manage a crisis, threatening the Alliance’s stability – we have a crisis protocol. This might involve convening an emergency member congress or involving an external mediator/facilitator to stabilize the situation. The Alliance could temporarily empower an interim committee (perhaps elder statespersons of the community or founders) to take charge of conflict resolution among leadership. Essentially, the membership has the ultimate sovereignty to reconstitute leadership if needed to save the Alliance. This is analogous to a constitutional clause for removing a president or calling a vote of no confidence. We hope never to use it, but its existence acts as a powerful deterrent to any leader who might neglect the values – they know the Alliance can and will act to correct leadership if ever required.
