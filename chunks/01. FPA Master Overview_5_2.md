- **Beyond Basic Funding – The Vote-to-Zero Stage:** The ultimate goal is to **eliminate mandatory dues entirely** once we’re self-sustaining. We call this the **“vote-to-zero”** phase of the pricing model. When the Alliance’s financials show that even the $100k cap is consistently more than our expenses (which could happen if we establish other revenue streams or if membership growth makes per-head costs negligible), the leadership can propose a vote to members: _“Shall we reduce membership fees further or abolish them?”_ If the majority agrees, dues could be dropped to an even lower cap or to **$0**. Essentially, the membership gets to **vote to zero-out the fee** when we’re ready.  
- This would mean the Alliance runs on donations, auxiliary income (like merchandise or training courses), or excess reserve funds, but not on required dues. It’s the ultimate expression of our fairness principle – we do not want to take money from members if we don’t need to. Even if set to $0, membership would still carry the expectation of contribution in other forms (time, effort, expertise), so free-riders aren’t an issue. And if in some future the Alliance faced new expenses, members could vote to reinstate a modest fee. **It’s democratic and fair**: those who pay are those who benefit, and they collectively decide the terms.
