- **“Founding Father” Tier Membership (Prototype):** As a trial, the FPA has introduced an optional premium membership tier nicknamed **Founding Father** (inclusive of all genders, despite the historic moniker). This is an annual subscription-based support tier for members who wish to contribute financially to the Alliance’s growth. Founding Father members pay a higher annual due (or donation) which goes towards funding things like better testing equipment, maintaining offline infrastructure, or subsidizing gear for low-income preparedness enthusiasts. In return, these members receive recognition (a special badge on their profile), early access to draft reports, and occasional invites to closed beta tests of new systems (like trying out a new mobile app for field reporting). **Importantly,** this tier **does not** grant any extra sway in endorsement votes or policy decisions – one person, one vote remains, and Readiness Cred must still be earned through participation. The intent is to bolster our resources without compromising principles. This program is experimental; we are monitoring whether it generates the expected support and how it’s perceived by the community. If it ever appears to create a “two-class” system or conflicts of interest, it will be reevaluated or scrapped. For now, it remains a voluntary way for passionate members to help FPA help everyone. (Experimental Clause – not an official requirement for membership.)
