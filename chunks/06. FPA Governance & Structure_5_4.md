- **Example – IP in Action:** A recent example of our IP stewardship philosophy was the development of the _Offline-First Field Guide App_. A small FPA tech team built a smartphone app that stores crucial guides (like first aid instructions, communication protocols, maps) entirely offline and syncs with local Bluetooth mesh. Instead of selling this app on an app store, we released it free for all FPA members and even offered it to disaster relief NGOs at no cost. We trademarked the name and kept the code open-source under an alliance-controlled license. This way, in an emergency, any member can download or share the app freely, and no outside entity can suddenly charge money for it or fill it with ads. We even have a “dead-man switch” clause: if the alliance ever disbands, the IP goes into an open trust so it remains available to preppers worldwide. **The bottom line:** everything we create is in service of preparedness and mutual aid, not in service of creating a tech startup or appeasing investors. Our intellectual property stays in the vault precisely so we can break the vault open when society needs it.
