- **Regional map set** with pre-marked rally points and frequencies (so teams know where to regroup and what channels to use if all else fails).  
All of these offline tools are kept current. Fallback materials are refreshed during drills and especially in **Prepared Mode (Phase2)** before a crisis hits. This approach is part of FPAâ€™s broader **[[Offline-First Resilience System]]**, ensuring that even if power and internet fail, every squad can continue to coordinate and access critical information. In short, the alliance can operate in the dark.
