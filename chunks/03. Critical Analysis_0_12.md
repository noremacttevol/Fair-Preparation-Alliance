Israel’s Defense and Civil Readiness: Israel offers a case where national defense and civilian readiness intersect closely. Surrounded by threats, Israel has universal conscription, meaning most adults have military training, and a dedicated Home Front Command that organizes civilian drills and infrastructure for protection. For example, public warning sirens are ubiquitous, and the government has distributed gas masks to citizens during certain crises (though not without shortfalls – around 2012 only ~45% of Israelis had gas masks and ~30% had access to reinforced shelters, highlighting gaps despite strong efforts). Israeli society’s “nation-in-arms” model ensures a high baseline of readiness: families clear out bomb shelters and stock supplies when tensions rise. The cultural norm is that everyone participates in defense, either as a soldier or a prepared civilian. For FPA, the takeaway is the importance of societal mobilization – making preparedness a duty or at least a common expectation. While the U.S. or other countries are not under constant attack like Israel, FPA could promote volunteerism analogous to reserve service – e.g. encouraging members to engage in regular emergency drills, first aid training, and mutual aid agreements. FPA might also push for local infrastructure improvements (as Israelis did, turning parking garages into shelters for thousands). The challenge is doing so without an external threat “forcing” such unity; FPA must create a narrative or
