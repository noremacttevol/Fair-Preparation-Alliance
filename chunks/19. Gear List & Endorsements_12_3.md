All checklist results should be logged in the **Gear Audit Journal** (physical) and then entered into the digital system. Photos, videos, and data files should be uploaded to the gear’s case file in the database. The checklist above may be adapted slightly for different categories of gear (e.g., medical supplies will have a different protocol focusing on sterility, efficacy, etc.), but generally this template is the baseline. The aim is thoroughness and consistency.  
**Vendor Transparency Log Template:** (This is how we record interactions with vendors regarding gear evaluations or endorsements. Every entry should follow this format for clarity.)  
- **Date & Time:** (e.g., 2025-06-15 14:30 EST)  
- **Vendor & Representative:** (e.g., “BrightBeam Co. – John Smith, Sales Manager”)  
- **FPA Participants:** (e.g., “Jane Doe (Gear Committee), Bob Roe (Test Squad Alpha)”)  
- **Mode of Interaction:** (Email, Phone Call, In-Person Meeting, Forum Post, etc.)  
- **Purpose of Interaction:** (e.g., “Vendor inquired about test results”, “FPA requested product sample”, “Follow-up on identified issue”, “Vendor offering discount”, etc.)
