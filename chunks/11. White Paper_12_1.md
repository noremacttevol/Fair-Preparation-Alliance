**Actionable Steps:**  
- Create an **FPA Band Plan** document listing frequencies for: national HF (shortwave) nets, regional VHF/UHF nets, and local squad use. Include mode (voice or digital) and time schedules for check-ins.  
- Allocate distinct HAM frequencies to each region for intra-region comms, plus a common inter-region calling frequency for relay squads (to contact each other in sequence).  
- Reserve a few channels in license-free bands (CB channel 9 or 36, FRS channel 7, etc.) as emergency fallback if HAM infrastructure or licensing is a problem. Publicize these to members who aren’t HAMs so they have an option.  
- Coordinate with partner organizations (CERT, Red Cross comms teams, etc.) to deconflict frequencies if needed, or to share a monitoring channel during joint operations.  
- Print pocket-sized frequency cards for all members, listing the FPA standard channels and simple instructions (these cards assume no internet and act as quick reference).  
- Establish a net control rotation: assign certain squads or operators to act as **Net Control** on common frequencies during large events, to direct traffic and prevent everyone transmitting at once.  
- Include the frequency plan as part of every new member’s orientation (maybe as a chapter in the Compass Guide addendum for Phase 3).
