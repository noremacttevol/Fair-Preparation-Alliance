- **Context-Aware Welcome:** Instead of a one-size welcome, the app greets users with messages that acknowledge their situation. For example, if an applicant indicated a concern about wildfires or chose “Family” in their profile, the welcome might say _“Glad you’re here! We know wildfires are on your mind – let’s start by securing your home and family for that risk.”_ ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=adaptive%20ai%20onboarding:%20once%20signed,user%20is%20then%20guided%20through/)). This immediately shows the user that FPA “gets” their needs. The [[User Journey Maps]] define common personas (e.g. a single urban dweller vs. a parent like _Susan_ in suburbia) and the system uses those cues to adjust language and priorities. This personal touch is achieved through FPA’s AI assistant analyzing their application and quiz answers.  
- **Ordered Onboarding Steps:** The app guides the user through the key features in a logical sequence, ensuring they don’t get lost. A typical flow (which can adjust based on the user’s context) might be:  
1. **Complete Profile & Preferences:** The user fills any remaining details (family size, pet, specific concerns) which allows further content tailoring ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=shes%20immediately%20greeted%20with%20a,experience%20to%20her%20familys%20needs-xh39e6b/)). Location info is confirmed to localize risk data.
