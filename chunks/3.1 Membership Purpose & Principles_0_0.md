FPA membership is founded on principles of fairness, mutual aid, and community resilience. Every member joins with a commitment to share knowledge, resources, and support, ensuring that preparedness is accessible to all and not just a privilege for a few. Trust and collaboration are emphasized over individualism—members prepare together so no one is left behind. This purpose aligns with the Alliance’s ethos that strong communities can better withstand and recover from disasters than isolated individuals.
