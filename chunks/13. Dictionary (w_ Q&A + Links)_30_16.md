Q14: What is FPA’s stance on bartering during crises?
A: FPA views bartering as a practical strategy during long-term crises where money might lose value or supply chains break down. The alliance likely advises members to have trade-worthy items as part of their preps – things like extra fuel, batteries, medical supplies, hygiene items, or skills they can offer (like repair work or medical aid) – not just for themselves but potentially to barter. However, FPA would also caution to do bartering carefully. They’d emphasize security: only trade in safe environments (like within your trusted network or a secure marketplace) and not advertising all you have when bartering. Fairness being a core FPA value, they’d encourage not price-gouging people in need – e.g., trading honestly without exploiting someone’s desperation (that ties back to the “fair preparation” ethos). Within FPA communities, barter might even be organized in a cooperative way: a local group could set up a swap meet for members to exchange goods and services so everyone fills gaps in their supplies. They probably also highlight skills as barter currency – knowing how to fix a generator or treat an injury could be more valuable than gold. In summary, FPA’s stance: bartering is a key contingency plan if the conventional economy falters, but do it ethically and safely, and think ahead about what items or skills you can trade without jeopardizing your own survival.
