**What’s already implemented (current wins):** We conducted a **Skills Survey** among members and collected data on over **50 skill categories**. This data has been visualized in the first iteration of the Skill Wheel, which is accessible on the FPA portal. Already, squads and chapter leaders are using it: for example, the Dallas squad saw they lacked any certified ham radio operator, prompting a member with interest to get licensed (solving that gap). Another squad realized they had no one fluent in another language which might be vital for community outreach, so they recruited a new member who spoke Spanish. Wins: **better team composition** – two smaller teams in one area merged (see Squad Merge-Logic, Innovation 10) after the Skill Wheel showed each alone was missing key skills but together they’d cover almost all. This directly improved their readiness. We’ve also seen **personal development** uptick; members are identifying skills they want to learn. The system awards a “Skill Badge” when someone attains a new competency (validated via training or testing). Over 40 skill badges have been awarded in the last quarter, ranging from First Aid to Carpentry, meaning members are actively upskilling to round out the wheel. Role Mapping success stories: the Northeast region did a camp exercise where roles (medic, security lead, comms lead, etc.) were assigned per the role mapping suggestions, and the feedback was that the operation ran very smoothly because everyone knew their
