**Action Steps:**  
- **Draft your emergency plan:** If you haven’t already, write down your plan covering key scenarios (fire, flood, blackout, etc.). Include: evacuation routes (multiple), emergency contacts, meeting points, and resource inventory (what supplies you have and need). Use the _Compass Guide_ templates or Ready.gov checklists as a starting point. This doesn’t need to be fancy – even bullet points on one page is fine – but it must be written.  
- **Run “Test My Plan” via FPAi:** Access the _Test My Plan_ feature on the FPA app or website (or via the FPAi Chatbot). It will ask you detailed questions about your plan. Answer honestly. The AI will then simulate a disaster (“Let’s say a 7.0 earthquake hits at 2 AM…”) and walk you through your response step by step, pointing out failures or gaps. Take notes on any weaknesses it finds. If you lack internet or the app, use the printed questionnaire from the _Offline System_ manual – same idea, on paper.  
- **Plug the holes:** For each gap identified, create a task to address it. If the simulation revealed you don’t have a backup water source, put “buy water storage containers” or “learn water purification (free methods)” on your to-do list. If it found you have no communications plan when separated, establish an out-of-state contact or meeting point. Treat this like a checklist to fix.
