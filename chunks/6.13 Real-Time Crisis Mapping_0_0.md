In fast-moving disasters, having a clear picture of what’s happening is invaluable. FPA has toyed with and implemented real-time crisis mapping tools to log incidents, resources, and member locations live during an event. Using open-source platforms like Ushahidi or custom GIS setups, the Alliance can create a map where members (or automated feeds) drop pins for things like “bridge out here,” “medical station set up here,” “riot reported here at 5pm,” etc. The innovation isn’t just the tech (though setting up an offline-capable crisis map server on a laptop is one aspect), but also the process: training members to report in a structured way so that data can be quickly mapped. For example, they use simple text or radio codes that translate to map entries (“CODE 10 at grid 3C” might mean flooded area at a known grid location). They might integrate GPS trackers from members’ phones or APRS beacons into the map, giving a live view of where key response teams are – this helps avoid duplication or know who’s closest to an incident. Even in Phase 3, if Realnet is up, a decentralized version of this map can run, with each node getting sync updates when it connects. The map also can show resources: where caches are, which shelters are open, etc., updated as things change (like marking a cache depleted or moving a medical kit icon to where it’s relocated). Visualizing the crisis in real time is a relatively new capability for grassroots groups, one that FPA embraces to coordinate
