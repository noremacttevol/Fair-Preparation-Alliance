then updates their plan accordingly – perhaps splitting items into a lighter “grab-first” bag and secondary bin, or choosing an alternate route that avoids a now-noticed choke point. The plan can be re-tested in a future cycle until both the member and reviewers are confident in it. Group Learning: The benefits of Test My Plan extend beyond the individual. With permission, lessons from these plan tests are anonymized and shared with the chapter. For example, “One family learned their backup batteries were drained when we simulated a power outage – reminder to all: check your battery stores regularly.” In this way, everyone learns from each test, not just the participant. It often sparks members to go home and double-check aspects of their own plan they hadn’t considered. Diversity of Scenarios: Members are encouraged to test various scenarios over time: evacuation (fire, chemical spill, etc.), home defense (what to do if intruders approach – albeit this is discussed rather than enacted for safety), communications blackout (how to gather info and reach out), medical emergency at home, etc. Each scenario reveals different weaknesses. FPA also encourages families to involve all members in their household for these tests – spouses, kids – so that everyone practices together.
