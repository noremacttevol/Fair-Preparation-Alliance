The Alliance has a stance against looting or raiding in disasters; instead it plans for [[Mutual Aid Among Members]] and prudent stockpiling so those measures aren’t necessary. An important ethical guideline is helping others fairly: FPA encourages members to assist neighbors and community members in emergencies when possible ([[Assisting Non-Members in Crisis]]), rather than adopting an “us vs. them” mentality – but to do so in a way that doesn’t unduly endanger the group. To maintain compliance, FPA leadership periodically consults with legal experts (some members might be lawyers or law enforcement who advise quietly) to review their SOPs and ensure no aspects could be interpreted as illegal (for example, making sure radio communication plans don’t violate FCC rules prior to any collapse scenario). In summary, FPA is committed to staying law-abiding and morally upright in all preparations. This commitment protects the Alliance’s longevity and reputation and reinforces internal trust – members know that by following FPA guidelines, they are preparing in a manner they can be proud of. (Cross-ref: [[Code of Conduct and Ethics]] for individual behavior rules, [[Public Image and Perception Management]] for how FPA’s legality and ethics affect its public reputation.)
