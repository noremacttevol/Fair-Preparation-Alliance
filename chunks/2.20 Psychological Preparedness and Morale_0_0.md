Surviving a crisis is as much a mental challenge as a physical one. FPA places emphasis on psychological preparedness – building mental resilience in advance – and actively maintaining morale during crises. Training for Stress: In Phase 1, FPA incorporates discussions and education about the psychological aspects of disasters. Members learn about the stages of psychological response (shock, adrenaline rush, potential panic, etc.) and coping techniques. Simple practices like deep breathing, mindfulness, or even faith-based encouragement (depending on members’ beliefs) are shared as tools for staying calm under pressure. Some drills (as mentioned in [[Drills and Simulations]]) include stress inoculation – timed tasks, unexpected injects – to simulate pressure and allow members to practice steady decision-making despite it. After such drills, feelings are debriefed too (“Who felt panic when X happened? Let’s talk about why and how we can manage that.”). This normalizes stress reactions and prepares members to handle them.
