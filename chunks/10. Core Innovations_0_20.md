**What’s next (30-day roadmap):** In the next 30 days, FPAi is moving from beta to general availability for all members. Key steps: (a) Implement the **30-Day Plan Improvement Challenge** – members who use FPAi to test their plan and then make updates can resubmit and see improved scores, earning a special badge (tying back to Gamified Membership). (b) Expand scenario types: currently FPAi covers 5 scenario types; we will add at least 3 more (such as economic crisis and pandemic lockdown scenarios). (c) Strengthen the critique engine’s **explanation layer** – we’re adding more references and links in its output so when it flags a gap, it points to the relevant FPA SOP or Compass Guide principle behind that advice. We will also address any AI blind spots uncovered in beta (for example, the beta showed the AI was not considering pet needs thoroughly – we’re updating it to include prompts about pets if the member has them per their plan). Our AI Oversight team (see Innovation 12) will concurrently run an **audit on FPAi’s recommendations** to ensure they remain unbiased and sound. By the end of the month, we expect FPAi to be a **widely used personal coach** for hundreds of members, making everyone’s plans more robust.
