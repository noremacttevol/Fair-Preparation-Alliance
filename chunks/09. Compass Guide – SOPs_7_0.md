From its inception, the FPA has envisioned its development in **three phases**. This scaling plan ensures we stay effective as we grow from a handful of people to a nationwide network augmented by AI. Each phase has a focus and we explicitly adjust how we operate at each stage:  
- **Phase 1: Grassroots Foundation (Current).** We are in Phase 1 now. This is the bootstrap phase – we rely entirely on human effort, local initiative, and basic technology. Our member count is relatively small (tens or hundreds, aiming up to a few thousand). In Phase 1, every member is expected to be very hands-on: organizing local meetups, manually sharing printed materials, doing things “the hard way” if needed. Our AI tools are in development or limited release, and our budget is tight, so we prioritize. The emphasis is on building a **strong culture and proof of concept**. We solidify our SOPs, demonstrate successful responses in local incidents, and iron out any kinks in training programs. This phase also locks in the “legacy” membership – those who join early (e.g., first 500 members) earn permanent legacy status and influence. The $5 monthly dues and volunteer labor sustain us. In Phase 1 you might wear many hats – one day you’re recruiting friends, the next day you’re learning to operate a HAM radio, all while holding a regular job and family obligations. It’s a grass-roots hustle, but it forges the core community.
