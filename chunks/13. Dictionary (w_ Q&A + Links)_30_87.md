stored outside main population centers, which they can retrieve when store shelves are empty. In long crises, they encourage rationing plans – preserving what you have. Another aspect is tools and know-how to repair and reuse: if a generator breaks and new parts can’t be shipped, maybe an engineer in FPA can jury-rig a fix from scrap. The knowledge base likely includes old-school techniques (like preserving food without freezers, making soap, etc.) to reduce dependency on new goods. So essentially, FPA manages supply chain breakdowns by planning ahead with stock and caches, sharing and allocating what’s on hand wisely, creating or substituting where possible, and by staying informed about any available resupply opportunities via their network. It’s not perfect, but it’s leaps better than each family fending alone when trucks stop rolling. [#Intermediate] [#Logistics]
