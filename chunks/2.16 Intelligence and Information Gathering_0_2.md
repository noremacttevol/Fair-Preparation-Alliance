solely on passive intel. They will sometimes send out members for reconnaissance if safe. For example, if they haven’t heard news about a nearby town where another chapter is, they might dispatch a two-person team in a vehicle to go check it out and come back with reports. Or in a localized scenario, if they want to know if looters are in the area, members might take turns doing watch patrols around the neighborhood or vantage points (using binoculars, etc.). These scouts keep the group informed of any incoming threats (like “there’s a large fire two miles south” or “a group of armed individuals were spotted heading this way”). Use of Technology: Some tech-savvy members may employ tools like drone surveillance (if they have a drone, flying it to see road conditions or check on a nearby property), or digital tools like emergency scanner apps, satellite messengers (for getting texts out if cell is down), or even connecting to amateur radio email (Winlink) to receive situation reports from afar. If the crisis is widespread, they might tap into networks like ARRL bulletins or SATCOM (satellite phones, if any member has one) for outside world news. Analysis and Dissemination: Raw info is not enough; FPA discusses what the intel means. If, for instance, the scanner indicates law enforcement is pulling out of certain areas, FPA infers those areas will be lawless and maybe to avoid them. If weather reports show incoming heavy rain after a quake, they prepare for landslides or mud.
