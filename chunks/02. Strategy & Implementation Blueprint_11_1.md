- **Mentoring Others:** Importantly, Phase III members often become mentors to Phase I or II members. This tests their ability to teach and lead by example. Mentoring reinforces their knowledge (one learns best by teaching) and instills a sense of responsibility for the growth of others, a key trait for future leaders.  
- **Broader Perspective:** We encourage Phase III individuals to also engage with FPA beyond their squad – perhaps joining cross-squad projects, contributing to updating SOPs or the Compass Guide with their expertise, or participating in Tribunal discussions as an observer. This exposes them to the governance and coordination aspect of FPA, not just squad-level activity.  
- **Evaluation:** To move to Phase IV, the member likely must demonstrate they can lead a full operation scenario successfully. This could be a simulated crisis where they act as the incident commander for multiple squads (with oversight from current leaders). Their decisions, adherence to the Trust Doctrine under pressure, and effectiveness are evaluated. The Tribunal or a council of existing leaders typically needs to give a nod as well, since Phase IV involves joining their ranks.  
_Phase III output:_ A seasoned, highly skilled member who is on the cusp of leadership – they combine deep expertise with the ability to guide others, embodying FPA’s values in action.
