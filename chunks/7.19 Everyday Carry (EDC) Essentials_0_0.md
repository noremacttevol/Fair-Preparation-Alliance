Everyday Carry refers to the items one keeps on their person daily to handle emergencies or unexpected situations. FPA encourages members to maintain a thoughtful EDC kit so that they are never caught completely unprepared. While EDC varies by individual and context (urban vs rural, office job vs field job), there are common essentials the Alliance highlights:  
- Multi-tool or knife: for cutting, prying, minor repairs (a good Leatherman or Swiss Army knife is popular).  
- Flashlight: a small LED flashlight or headlamp, with spare batteries, to deal with darkness or signal.  
- Fire source: such as a lighter or ferro rod, in case one needs to start a fire for warmth or signaling.  
- Emergency whistle: for audible signaling if in distress (small and easy to carry).  
- Mini first-aid: a few bandages, antiseptic wipes, any personal medication (like an EpiPen or inhaler if needed).  
- Water and/or filter: at least a half-liter water bottle and possibly a collapsible filter straw or purification tablets.  
- Phone and backup: obviously most carry a phone; FPA suggests a backup power bank or charging cable as part of EDC.  
- Cash and IDs: some cash in small bills and a government ID, plus any relevant medical cards (in a waterproof sleeve).  
- Notepad and pen: to leave notes, take info, or communicate if verbal isn’t possible.  
- Key tools: e.g., a small pry bar, or a pair of gloves, depending on one’s daily environment.
