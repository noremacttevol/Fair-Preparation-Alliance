horn pattern) to alert nearby members if needed. Immediate Actions: Each member has a checklist of immediate actions upon receiving an activation notice: secure their home and family, grab go-bags or pre-load vehicles if evacuation is likely, and establish contact on the primary FPA comm channel (typically the Realnet node or designated radio frequency). They’ll also switch to using their FPA call signs and codes to coordinate. If the emergency is localized, unaffected members might begin staging to assist (for instance, if one member’s neighborhood is on fire, others outside that area activate to help with evacuation). Rally and Accountability: One of the first steps is accounting for everyone. The group does a roll call via comms – anyone who doesn’t respond is noted, and if safe, someone physically checks on them. Rally points might be used: depending on scenario, either a primary rally location (if evacuation/bug-out scenario) or simply hunker down and communicate (if shelter-in-place scenario). FPA’s plan usually designates an initial meeting place if communications are out – e.g., “If no comms and it’s safe to travel, all who can will meet at Location X by 6 PM.” The activation protocols include time windows – “If you haven’t heard from leadership within Y hours of trigger, proceed with autonomous group rally.” Role Assignments: At activation, certain members assume predefined roles. For example, the Communications Lead will ensure the Realnet node is up or that radio
