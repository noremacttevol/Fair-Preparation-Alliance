In summary, the field-ready mobile ground unit is our answer to keeping the **lights on and information flowing on the move**. It embodies many of our core principles: offline-first (works without external networks), resilient (solar power, EMP-resistant), interoperable (multiple comm channels), and knowledge-equipped (AI/offline data integration). Every FPA region should aim to equip as many squads as possible with such units, and at minimum have a few per chapter available for rapid deployment. They turn a small team into a self-reliant cell that can plug into the greater Alliance network or operate autonomously if cut off. In a protracted grid-down scenario, these units will likely become the nucleus of our post-collapse communities â€“ powering not just radios, but potentially tools like water purifiers, medical devices, and more. They are an investment in **true operational readiness**.
