Perhaps the most futuristic aspect of Mk1Mod3 is the built-in AI assistant, affectionately nicknamed “FPAi”. This isn’t a cloud-based AI like Siri or Google Assistant that stops working offline – it’s a locally running AI model fine-tuned for preparedness scenarios. Here’s what it does:  
- **Interactive Q&A:** You can ask FPAi questions in natural language. “How do I stop bleeding from a deep cut?” and it will pull from the SHTF Bible and medical guides to give you a concise answer, step by step. It’s like having a seasoned expert on call 24/7. During crises when human experts (doctors, engineers) might not be immediately reachable, this can be a lifesaver. Of course, it comes with disclaimers – it’s offering best-effort advice, not perfect wisdom, but it’s often better than guessing alone.  
- **Decision Support:** The AI can help weigh options. For example, “Should we evacuate given this situation?” and it might respond with a list of factors to consider: the latest weather forecast (if it has it), the status of roads (from reports it knows about), the vulnerabilities of your shelter, etc. It won’t make the decision for you, but it will ensure you’ve thought of the pertinent things – essentially an intelligent checklist.
