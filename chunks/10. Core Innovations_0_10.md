**What’s already implemented (current wins):** The Dictionary now contains **200+ terms** (covering technical terms, slang, and FPA-specific concepts), and the SOP Hub hosts **50+ SOPs and checklists**. These aren’t static documents – members have contributed improvements through an edit suggestion system, with oversight by our Knowledge Officers. Wins so far include a **unified terminology** across FPA: for example, we clarified definitions of alert levels (what “Condition Black” means) so every squad uses them consistently ([Help Doc Debt: 80% of Knowledge Bases are Out of Date | Brainfish](https://www.brainfishai.com/blog/help-doc-debt-knowledge-bases-are-out-of-date#:~:text=documented,without%20requiring%20constant%20human%20oversight)). The SOP Hub has dramatically increased member self-sufficiency; instead of asking basic questions on forums, members are finding answers in the knowledge base (e.g., our “72-hour kit assembly” SOP was viewed 1,200 times last month). We’ve also linked the knowledge base to the FPAi engine (Innovation 5), so the AI uses **FPA-approved info** when critiquing plans. This ensures our AI recommendations align with our collective wisdom. The **living** nature is evident – just last week, after a member’s real-world experience in a wildfire, we updated the “Wildfire Evacuation” SOP with lessons learned.
