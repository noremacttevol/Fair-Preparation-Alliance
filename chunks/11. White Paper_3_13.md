- **Store safely and accessibly:** Once you have your 14-day cache, store it smartly. Water in durable containers (avoid flimsy plastic that can leak), food in rodent-proof bins if in garage, etc. Spread out the cache if possible (some in pantry, some hidden) in case part of your home is destroyed. Most importantly, ensure everyone in the household knows where these supplies are. It’s useless if only mom knows and she’s not home when disaster hits.  
- **Maintain and refresh:** Schedule regular maintenance days (at least twice a year, say every daylight savings change or every April and October) to check on your supplies. Rotate any food nearing expiration into your regular meals (replace it on next store trip). Test flashlights and generators. This discipline separates the truly prepared from the hoarder who discovers too late that half his stock is spoiled.
