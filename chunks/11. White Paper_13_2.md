- Use a simple, pre-formatted message form for the exercise (e.g., “Resource Request: [What], [Where], [Urgency]”) and disseminate copies of this form beforehand.  
- During the drill, have each regional relay squad operate on a schedule, checking in with adjacent regions and then the next, to pass traffic methodically (like a bucket brigade of information).  
- Simultaneously, broadcast periodic updates via Outernet to all regions (e.g., a situation report every 4 hours). Instruct squads to compare what they receive via radio vs Outernet to ensure consistency.  
- Log everything: each squad and relay should keep a written log of messages sent/received and time delays. Collect these logs post-drill for analysis.  
- After action: convene a debrief with representatives from all regions (virtually or via radio/Outernet if needed) to discuss what went wrong or right. Document the findings and update protocols (frequency plan, training focus, etc.) accordingly.
