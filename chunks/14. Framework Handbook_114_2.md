- **AI Assistance:** Members consult FPAi for things like “checklist for hurricane home prep” – it responds with the SOP summary (bring loose items indoors, set fridge to coldest setting, fill bathtub with water, etc.). This helps ensure even less-experienced members don’t miss steps. The AI also predicts (based on weather and past data) potential cascading issues: e.g., “High chance of extended power outage; ensure backup power for any medical devices,” which squads already are doing but it reinforces the urgency.
