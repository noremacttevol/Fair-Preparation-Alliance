7. **Scope Creep and Complexity:** As we add more features (especially by Phase3), there’s a risk the system becomes too complicated to use or maintain. If members see it as a bureaucratic chore or something overwhelmingly complex, it could backfire and reduce engagement. **Mitigations:** We will adhere to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles in the user experience. For the average member, interacting with the Skill Wheel should feel straightforward: _learn skills → log/validate them → see your wheel grow_. They shouldn’t need to know about all the weights, algorithms, or data flows under the hood (those can live in documentation for those interested). Each phase’s rollout will come with training and clear comms so that new features aren’t a surprise. On the backend, we’ll be cautious about feature bloat – every addition must have a clear value. If a particular data point isn’t proving useful, we might stop tracking it. By Phase3, we expect to possibly have dedicated support (maybe an admin team or even an AI assistant) to help manage the system. For example, if manually reviewing anomalies becomes too much, an AI script might automatically do first-pass checks. We’ll also modularize the system so that if one part fails or is too much, it can be revised without taking everything down.
