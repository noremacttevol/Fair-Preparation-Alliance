A core principle guiding the Skill Wheel is to be **“honest but motivating.”** The percentages displayed on a member’s wheel are calibrated to mean something concrete in terms of survival capability, and the way we present those scores is intended to encourage progress without either complacency or despair.  
We’ve internally defined rough benchmarks for overall preparedness levels:  
- **50%** – signifies _“likely to survive if FPA remains active and can assist.”_ A member around 50% in most categories has a solid basic proficiency. In a moderate disaster scenario, especially with support from the FPA network (communications, supplies, guidance), this person stands a good chance. However, in extreme scenarios they would still be in trouble without help. 50% is essentially a competent beginner or intermediate survivor.  
- **75%** – signifies _“very likely to survive in most disasters.”_ At ~75%, the member has a well-rounded and advanced skill set. They probably have multiple redundancies (backup skills, cross-training) and can handle many crisis situations independently. This level might be akin to an FPA expert or veteran member. Someone at 75% might even take leadership roles during emergencies. Still, this is not a guarantee of survival – there are always scenarios that can overwhelm even very prepared individuals.
