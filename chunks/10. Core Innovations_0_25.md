our Outernet radio network (Innovation 7): several radio repeaters now run on solar+battery, meaning our emergency comms wonâ€™t fail for lack of power. This program has also forged partnerships; we got a donation of solar panels from a green energy NGO and technical advice from volunteers in the solar industry, showing the strength of combining resilience with sustainability values.
