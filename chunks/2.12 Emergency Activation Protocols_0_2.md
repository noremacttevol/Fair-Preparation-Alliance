proceed with autonomous group rally.” Role Assignments: At activation, certain members assume predefined roles. For example, the Communications Lead will ensure the Realnet node is up or that radio relays are staffed (if using ham operators to bounce messages). The Medic member checks that medical kits are ready and may pre-position at the rally point. The Security/Scout members might go ahead to the rally or safehouse to secure it before others arrive. The Quartermaster would begin packing shared supplies into vehicles. These roles are pre-planned so that little discussion is needed in the moment. Information Gathering: Simultaneously, FPA activates its intelligence gathering. Members monitor emergency broadcasts, news, social media (if up), or use scanners. They feed updates into the group comms – “City is ordering evacuation of downtown”, “Power outage extends across three counties”, etc. This helps refine the response (maybe the group decides to relocate further if the situation looks worse than thought). Phased Activation: Sometimes activation is incremental. For a looming threat like a slow-coming hurricane, FPA might go into a “standby” activation first (alert everyone to be ready) and then a full activation closer to impact. For sudden events, it’s immediate. Integrating New Info: As the situation evolves, the protocols adapt. E.g., if initial plan was to rally at Safehouse A but intel says route to A is blocked, the Communications Lead will relay “Alternate rally at
