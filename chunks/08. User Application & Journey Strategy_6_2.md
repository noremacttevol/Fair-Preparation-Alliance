- **Redundancy in Communication:** A user’s journey into FPA quickly brings them to set up multiple channels of communication. The **online layer** includes the app chat and email notifications. The **offline layer** includes HAM radio, and by Phase3 potentially **mesh networks or satellite (Outernet)** for those equipped ([FPA_All_Content_2024_dedup.md](file://xn--file-hjqcqt2gbaare3mtak2s6c%23:~:text=%20offline%20layer%20\(grid-s9019d/)). The key is that every important communication (alerts, updates) is duplicated across channels:  
- Regular **HAM broadcasts** (e.g., weekly national or regional updates over a designated frequency) are established. Users are trained to tune in at those times. This might be how a critical update is delivered if the app is unreachable.  
- **SMS fallbacks** could be used for critical alerts (since SMS might work when internet is out). The system can store a member’s phone for emergency texting.
