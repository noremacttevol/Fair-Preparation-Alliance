FPA operates nationwide, and conditions vary, so the SOP Compass Guide allows for _localized annexes_. For example, a coastal community’s flood SOP might have an annex about tsunamis, whereas an inland community’s version might focus on river floods. We encourage squads to add notes relevant to local infrastructure (like “if bridge X is out, use route Y”). These are documented as appendices to the standardized SOP so that 90% of the content is uniform, and the last 10% is tailored.  
Importantly, the SOPs are guidelines, not iron-clad law. Squad Leaders have discretion to deviate if unique circumstances demand it. The Trust Doctrine (Chapter 3) underpins this – we trust our people to use good judgment. The SOP is there to back them up, not box them in.
