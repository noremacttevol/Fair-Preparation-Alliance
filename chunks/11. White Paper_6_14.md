- _Contingency Plan:_ If formal training opportunities are scarce, use the FPA Compass Guide’s training modules (if available) to run your own in-squad training sessions. In truly remote or resource-poor areas with no internet, use printed manuals or handouts – FPA can help provide these via the Compass Guide. Should language be a barrier (e.g., some members aren’t fluent in English), tap bilingual members or translation resources to ensure understanding. Finally, if a member simply cannot attend any training due to work/childcare, try a **train-the-trainer** approach: one person attends and then teaches the rest in an informal session. No one gets left behind in skill-building.
