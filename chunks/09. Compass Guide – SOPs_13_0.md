#### Integrating Readiness Tools into SOP Navigation  
The Compass Guide serves as a procedural bridge between static documentation and dynamic mission execution. To operationalize it fully, key readiness tools are now embedded in all SOP layers:  
- **[[TERM:OpCheck]]**: Every SOP block includes pre-op and post-op OpCheck anchors to verify real-time capability.
- **[[TERM:Squad Wheel]]**: Team alignment checks are embedded into planning stages for multi-role coordination. Used especially in E5+ SOPs.
- **[[TERM:Skill Delta]]**: SOP tasks are tagged with delta flags based on elevation targets; deviations are auto-flagged in Sync Dashboard.
- **[[TERM:Gear Pool]]**: Each SOP lists required gear tiers. Members without authorized gear (based on elevation or TMP) are marked as "non-operational" for that segment.  
These integrations ensure that SOP execution is:  
1. **Validated** (checked against readiness and authorization)
2. **Team-synced** (mapped against Squad Wheel coherence)
3. **Adaptive** (skill deltas are used to assign stretch tasks or defer to backups)
4. **Bounded** (Gear Pool boundaries ensure task assignment fits actual kit access)
