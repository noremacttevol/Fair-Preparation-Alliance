Q30: Why practice emergency drills and scenarios?
A: Because when a real emergency happens, you don’t want to be figuring things out for the first time. Practicing drills (like fire drills, evacuation drills, or “bug-out” runs) makes your response more automatic and efficient. It builds muscle memory. For example, if you’ve done a home fire drill, your family knows exactly how to exit quickly and where to meet – instead of freezing or wasting precious seconds in confusion. Drills also help you identify weaknesses in your plans or gear. Maybe you discover it takes too long to gather your things, or a chosen escape route isn’t practical – better to find that out during a practice run than during a real crisis. In short, rehearsing emergency actions boosts confidence, reduces panic, and can shave life-saving minutes off your response time when it counts. [#Beginner] [#Training]
