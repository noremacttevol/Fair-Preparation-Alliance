- **Trust Firewall:** The Trust Firewall is our internal security and vetting mechanism. It’s not a single piece of software (though it includes tech tools) so much as a policy: _untrusted inputs don’t get straight through to our core_. Whether it’s a new member, a piece of intel, or a sudden order, we have checks to validate it before acting. At the membership level, as mentioned, new folks have limited access until vetted – that’s the firewall preventing possible trolls or infiltrators from wreaking havoc. Information-wise, if someone broadcasts an unverified emergency alert to the network, our Trust Firewall protocol kicks in: designated members (with roles in intel or comms) will quickly fact-check through secondary sources or on-the-ground confirmation before we redirect the entire alliance’s efforts. Think of it as **fraud detection for rumors and directives**. This prevents panic or misdirection (we won’t mobilize to the wrong location because of one unconfirmed report). Culturally, it means we trust our members overall, but we verify when something or someone new comes into the system. It’s an **immune response** – identify the unknown element, test it, then either neutralize it (if it’s harmful) or incorporate it (if it’s good). The Trust Firewall is continually refined (with input from our AI oversight tools) to strike the right balance between openness and security. Our goal is to never let “being trusting” devolve into being gullible or vulnerable. We trust
