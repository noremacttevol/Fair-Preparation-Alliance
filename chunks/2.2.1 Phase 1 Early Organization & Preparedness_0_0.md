Phase 1 is the Alliance’s formative stage, corresponding to “normal” times (before any major SHTF event). In this phase, FPA’s focus is on building the network and ensuring every member is as prepared as possible. Key activities in Phase 1 include:  
Recruitment and Vetting: Identifying like-minded individuals and bringing them into FPA (see [[Recruitment Strategy]] and [[Vetting and Screening Process]]). Growth is steady and cautious to maintain trust.  
Training and Skill Development: Members engage in regular training sessions – from first aid classes, navigation and wilderness survival practice, to technical workshops on radio communication. The [[Training and Skills Development Program]] lays out a curriculum of essential prepper skills everyone should attain during Phase 1.  
Knowledge Consolidation: The alliance compiles and distributes vital information. The creation of the [[“Whole Book” Master Documentation]] happens in this phase – a compendium of all FPA protocols, guides, and references. Also, the [[“SHTF Bible” Comprehensive Manual]] (covering scenario-specific knowledge) is written/assembled. Members study these materials and contribute their expertise to continuously refine them.
