The SOP Compass Guide is organized by scenario type (e.g., “House Fire”, “Flooding”, “Long-term Power Outage”, “Pandemic Wave”, “Civil Unrest”, etc.), and each scenario’s SOP is further broken into priority categories that align with the acronym **COMPASS**:  
- **C – Command & Communicate:** Establish who is in charge (usually the Squad Leader by default) and communicate the situation. This includes accounting for all squad members (headcount) and contacting necessary parties (calling emergency services if appropriate, alerting the FPA network via radio/app, etc.). Clear initial communication sets the tone and gathers help early.  
- **O – Observe & Orient:** Assess the situation. This is where members gather information: What exactly is happening? Is everyone safe? How is the environment changing (rising water, spreading fire, etc.)? The squad’s Scout or any available member does a quick observation sweep. The team then orients itself to this reality, updating the plan as needed. Essentially: “get your bearings” before rushing into action.  
- **M – Mitigate & Mobilize:** Take immediate actions to mitigate harm. This could mean beginning first aid (Medic’s role), putting out small fires (if safe), or moving people to safer areas. Mobilize necessary resources – grab go-bags, start generators, deploy fire extinguishers, whatever the SOP calls for. It’s about addressing the most pressing threats to life and critical infrastructure right away.
