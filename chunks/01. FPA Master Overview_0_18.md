Emergency Flexibility (Member-Controlled): What if a catastrophe strikes before we reach “vote-to-zero” and extra funds are needed fast? We built in safeguards. The $100k cap can be raised temporarily, by member vote, in a true emergency. For example, if a national crisis demands raising significant funds beyond our reserves, leadership might propose a one-time cap increase: “For the next 2 months, shall we raise the cap to $200k to finance X relief effort?” If two-thirds of members agree (we require a supermajority to take more money), then it happens – and even then it’s a capped, transparent measure that expires. This prevents leadership from ever milking the membership without clear approval. Conversely, if we’re flush with donations or external funding at some point, we could even vote to lower the cap below $100k for a while. The membership always has the final say.  
In summary, our funding scales with us and then tapers off when possible. It’s a living system that reflects our values: self-reliance, fairness, and transparency. As an FPA member, you’re not a customer buying a service – you’re a stakeholder building an alliance. The Dynamic Pricing Model ensures your money is always used for the mission, and the moment it isn’t needed, it’s not taken. That’s fair preparation in action.
