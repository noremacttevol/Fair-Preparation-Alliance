- Celebrate the change: if two squads merge, maybe hold a little joint exercise or social event to bond the new team. If splitting, ensure both new squads feel equally recognized as full entities (not “original vs breakaway” – perhaps even let them choose fresh names to avoid hierarchy).
**Contingency Plan:** If a squad resists a needed merge or split despite issues (maybe pride or fears involved), regional leadership can organize more support (like help with recruitment if they fear losing identity, or reassurance that splitting won’t isolate them). No forced reorg will occur – we lean on persuasion and obvious benefits. In case a merger goes through but internal conflicts linger (perhaps two former leaders now jostling for one spot), we’ll keep a close eye and offer leadership coaching or an agreeable role for each (one could be deputy, or one leads and the other focuses on training, etc.). If a split results in one faction struggling, we ensure the regional network gives that new squad extra help so they don’t flounder. Ultimately, if a particular area keeps oscillating (merge then split then merge), it might indicate personal issues or mis-drawn boundaries; the council can step in to reevaluate the situation holistically and adjust as needed. The protocols are a guide, not a hard law – human factors are always considered, and if the standard approach fails, we handle it case-by-case via the council or conflict resolution team.
