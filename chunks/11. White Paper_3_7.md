- **Do a physical drill:** Don’t stop at the Q&A. Physically simulate at least one scenario a year. For example, one weekend, turn off your power and water for 48 hours. Practice using your supplies, and see what breaks first. (Does your family know how to deploy the generator? Can you actually cook on that camp stove?) Use our FPA Drill Guide for a step-by-step script if needed. This will reveal things the Q&A might miss (like the fact that your flashlight batteries are all dead – a common surprise).  
- **Update your plan & share key points:** Incorporate all improvements into your written plan. Then, **communicate your plan** to those who need to know – family members, a trusted friend, or your FPA mentor (see Phase1.6). At minimum, someone outside your household should have a copy of your emergency contact list and know your general plan (in case you go missing, they can inform rescuers).  
- **Leverage FPAi for what-ifs:** Use the FPAi Chatbot to ask “what if” questions anytime you’re unsure. For example, “What if my primary evacuation is blocked?” Our AI is trained on the FPA knowledge base and can suggest alternatives (with the caveat that tech might be down in a real event, so use it now while you can). Always double-check critical advice with a human expert or trusted source if possible.
