**Description:** Lay the groundwork for FPA to expand beyond national borders by identifying partner communities or diaspora groups in other countries interested in forming their own FPA squads. This preparation includes sharing our Phase 1-3 playbooks, adapting them to local contexts, and establishing communication links.
**Real-World Example:** In 2027, FPA leaders held virtual meetings with volunteer groups in Canada and the UK who had followed our progress. We provided them with translated Compass Guides and Trust Doctrine documents. Soon, pilot squads in Toronto and London began using the FPA model, effectively becoming the first international chapters.
**Lessons Learned:** We learned that our system isn’t one-size-fits-all globally – local laws and cultures required tweaks (for instance, radio licensing differs by country). Starting slow and respecting local autonomy was crucial. We also confirmed that our core values (trust, decentralization) resonated universally, which was encouraging.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Identify at least 3 countries with strong community preparedness movements and reach out via personal networks or social media.  
- Share FPA’s Phase 1-3 guides, and offer mentorship to interested foreign leaders on how to bootstrap squads, emphasizing they can and should adapt to local needs.  
- Set up an international liaison team within FPA to handle communications, time zone coordination, and cultural advice for global partners.
