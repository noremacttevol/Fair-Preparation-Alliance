- **Test My Plan:** This tool evaluates members’ personal emergency plans via scenario simulation. We’ve described how it can feed into identifying skill gaps. To reiterate the synergy: the Skill Wheel encourages learning of individual skills; _Test My Plan_ checks how those skills are applied in a holistic plan. The integration ensures that planning (which is cross-functional by nature) influences training. If _Test My Plan_ finds, for example, that a member’s plan has no answer for “what if the main route is blocked?”, that hints at maybe a Navigation or planning skill gap – which the Skill Wheel can then highlight or direct them to fix. In the future, we might allow _Test My Plan_ results to directly unlock certain achievements on the Skill Wheel. Perhaps successfully passing a very comprehensive plan test gives a member a tag like “Plan-Validated” or contributes a bit to multiple segments (since a good plan implies effective integration of medical, comms, nav, etc.). This is somewhat experimental, but the key point is the tools will work in concert: _Test My Plan_ makes sure members not only have skills in isolation but can integrate them, and the Skill Wheel ensures they have the skills to begin with to make a solid plan.
