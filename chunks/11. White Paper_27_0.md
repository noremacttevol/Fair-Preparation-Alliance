**Description:** Develop guidelines for adjusting squad structures as membership fluctuates – including merging small squads, spinning off new squads from an overgrown one, or redistributing members if some areas thin out. This ensures the FPA network remains optimally organized for local effectiveness and that no squad becomes too weak or too unwieldy. The protocols will provide a fair, transparent process for such changes, driven by local members’ input, to maintain both efficiency and harmony.
**Real-World Example:** By 2026, in some big cities the initial squads had grown to 50+ members – too large to be nimble. In one case, the Phoenix squad followed the new protocol to split into three neighborhood-based squads, each with its own leader, while forming a city council to stay coordinated. Conversely, in a rural part of Kansas, two tiny squads of 5 each decided to merge into one, after realizing they were duplicating efforts and both below critical mass. These changes, done under FPA’s merger guidelines, preserved morale (no one felt a takeover) and improved overall readiness – the Phoenix break-out squads could train more frequently in smaller groups, and the merged Kansas squad could field a full team where two half-teams struggled before.
