By the end of Phase 1, a member is expected to be **self-sufficient in basic comms** – meaning if the power goes out right now, they know how to turn on their battery radio, tune to the Alliance local channel, and either receive instructions or ask for help in an orderly way. They won’t be running the show, but they won’t be lost either. This is fundamental: no one graduates Phase 1 without proving they won’t be a communications liability in a crisis.  
**Phase 2 – Team Operator (ORP II: Operator):** In Phase 2, the member moves from just taking care of themselves to being an active part of a squad’s coordinated efforts. The training here dives deeper into technology and procedures, often introducing HAM radio fundamentals and advanced planning concepts. Requirements and training highlights:  
- **Amateur Radio License:** Phase 2 members are strongly encouraged (and in some chapters, required) to obtain an entry-level amateur radio license (such as the Technician license in the U.S.). If not legally possible, they must at least undergo equivalent training to operate on amateur bands under supervision during emergencies. This licensing process itself is educational, teaching them about radio propagation, frequency bands, and regulations.
