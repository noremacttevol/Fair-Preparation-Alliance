**Why it was created (problem it solves):** As FPA grew, it became clear we needed a better handle on **who knows what** and **who can do what**. Previously, skill information was ad-hoc; a lot of talent was hidden or underutilized, and some critical roles were missing in certain squads. This system solves the problem of **uncoordinated skill utilization**. By mapping skills, we prevent redundancy (avoiding teams of five radio operators but no medic, for example) and identify when training is needed (if no one in a region has a certain skill, that’s a training opportunity). It also tackles member engagement – people are more motivated when they have a clear role. Knowing “I am the unit’s navigator and herbal medicine specialist” gives identity and responsibility. Essentially, the Skill Wheel and Role Mapping bring **structure and clarity** to how we organize our human capital, making us more effective and each member more valued. _In emergency response teams, members have distinct roles with unique responsibilities ([Emergency Response Team: Roles and Responsibilities - School of Public Health](https://publichealth.tulane.edu/blog/emergency-response-team/#:~:text=An%20emergency%20response%20team%20is,to%20a%20specific%20community%E2%80%99s%20needs)) – this principle of defined roles is what we’re emulating in a prepper context to boost coordination and performance._
