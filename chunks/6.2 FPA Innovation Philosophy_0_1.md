FPA approaches innovation with a clear philosophy: blend proven methods with creative new solutions, and ensure they are practical for all members. The Alliance doesn’t adopt technology for technology’s sake; each innovation is evaluated for how it increases resilience, accessibility, or fairness. There’s an emphasis on appropriate tech – sometimes a low-tech solution (like a hand pump for a well) can be more robust than a high-tech one (like an electric pump that might fail without power). FPA’s innovators often ask, “Can this work in all three phases?” If a tool or process can function in grid-up and grid-down scenarios, it’s valued highly. Moreover, innovations are shared and taught openly within the group; a fancy device is no good if only one person knows how to use it. The Alliance encourages a culture of experimentation: members tinker in “prep labs” at home, then bring successful prototypes or ideas to the group for testing. This could range from building a DIY solar generator, to programming a custom emergency alert app. Crucially, FPA keeps innovations fair and inclusive: cost is considered (can everyone afford this or can we bulk-purchase to reduce expense?), and complexity is managed (can a layperson learn this?). In summary, the Alliance’s innovation ethos is to innovate deliberately – take the best of old and new, try it out, refine it through member feedback, and roll it out in a way that every member benefits.
