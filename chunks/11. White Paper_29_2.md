**Lessons Learned:** One lesson is that frequent minor tweaks are better than rare big overhauls. By reviewing every two years (or even annually informally), issues can be addressed before they fester. We learned to set high bars for altering core principles – not everything needs changing – but also not to treat the original word as sacred if reality proves otherwise. For instance, our Trust Doctrine initially assumed no formal partnerships, but Phase 3 taught us we could partner without losing independence, so we adjusted that language to reflect healthy collaboration. The AI proved helpful in tracking changes, ensuring we didn’t introduce loopholes or contradictions (like it caught that a new safety rule conflicted with our empowerment ethos until reworded). We also made sure to enshrine the member-vote requirement for these changes, so no future leadership could quietly rewrite the rules. Perhaps the biggest lesson is that this open revision process became an asset: new members, seeing that everything is up for honest review, felt more empowered to suggest improvements, knowing FPA isn’t stuck in the past.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Set a schedule for official reviews (e.g., every 2 years a convention, with emergency amendments possible in between if critically needed). Publish this schedule in the Compass Guide so everyone knows when big decisions are coming.
