FPA Master Overview — Mk1Mod3  
Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA) is a grassroots network of serious preppers united by a no-nonsense mission: to organize, equip, and train for worst-case scenarios in a fair and transparent way. This Master Overview (Mk1Mod3) serves as a strategic compass – aggressively realistic and action-focused. It strips out fluff and bureaucracy, giving you a clear blueprint to act on today. The world won’t wait for us to get ready, and this guide ensures we won’t need it to.  
We break down FPA’s strategy into three phases of development (see the [[Operational Readiness Progression (ORP) Master Plan]] for the detailed roadmap), outline our Dynamic Pricing Model for member funding, and lay out the Rank Structure powered by our Alliance Points (AP) system. You’ll also get an overview of the five core content families that drive every FPA operation – from technology to training to governance. Throughout, we reference real, functional elements of the Alliance – like our 7.200MHz radio pulse frequency for daily check-ins, the use of the Outernet (satellite data broadcasts), the SHTF Manual every member carries, squad-based team logic, tiered gear lists, live audit feeds for transparency, and member-driven regional voting. When you’re done reading, you’ll know exactly how FPA operates and where you fit in. No excuses – let’s get to work. (For background on the origins and ethos of FPA, see [[Why FPA Mk1Mod2 Public]].)
