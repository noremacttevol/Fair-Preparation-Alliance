- **Tamper-Proofing:** We implement measures to ensure logs cannot be altered without detection. This might involve cryptographic signatures by multiple parties, or using an immutable data store. We may even leverage blockchain or a hash-chain technique where each log entry’s hash is combined with the previous, forming a chain that if broken, shows evidence of tampering. Selected hashes could be shared widely (even outside the organization, e.g., posted on a public site) so that even an internal bad actor cannot secretly rewrite history – the rest of the world or at least many members hold proof of what the log looked like at a certain time.  
- **Audits:** Periodically, an audit is conducted where random entries from the log are verified on the ground. For instance, if the log says “Squad Echo ran a medical response drill on May 1”, an auditor might ask Squad Echo members “Did this drill happen as recorded? Did anything get left out?” This ensures the logs reflect reality and that members feel empowered to speak up if something wasn’t logged correctly. Moreover, it checks that no one is quietly skipping required tasks and just entering false logs (this would be a serious breach of trust – and practically, since multiple members are involved in any event, it would be hard to fake without conspiracy).
