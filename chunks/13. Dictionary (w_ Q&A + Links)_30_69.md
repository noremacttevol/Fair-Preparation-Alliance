multiple chapters participate simultaneously, to test longer-range communication and mutual aid (e.g., Chapter A radios that they need fuel, can Chapter B arrange to bring some?). After the exercise, they gather feedback – what tools broke, what supplies ran out, which plans were impractical – and update their strategies. These grid-down sims are challenging and eye-opening, often revealing morale factors too (living without modern comforts is hard on people). By practicing, FPA members build confidence that if the real thing hits, it won’t be their first time operating in the dark, literally and figuratively. [#Intermediate] [#Training]
