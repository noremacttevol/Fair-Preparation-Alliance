**(9) Skill Wheel + Role Mapping System**
**What it is:** A visual and interactive **Skill Wheel** that maps out the diverse skills within our alliance and a **Role Mapping** system to assign or identify roles for members based on those skills. Imagine a wheel or chart with slices for each skill domain (e.g., Medical, Engineering, Agriculture, Security, Comms, Logistics, Leadership, etc.) and members’ proficiencies plotted on it. The “Skill Wheel” gives a snapshot of **what capabilities we have and where our gaps lie**. The Role Mapping part uses that data to help form well-rounded squads and to guide members into roles where they’re most needed and can be most effective (e.g., designating someone as a Medic if they have medical training, or Quartermaster if they excel in logistics and inventory). It’s essentially a framework to ensure **everyone has a place and purpose** in our alliance, and that teams have all critical roles covered. It also encourages members to upskill by visually showing how filling certain skill gaps strengthens the whole.
