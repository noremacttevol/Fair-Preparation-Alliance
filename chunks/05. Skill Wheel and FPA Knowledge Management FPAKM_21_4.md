- **Careful Gamification (if any):** If we choose to introduce any gamified elements, Phase3 is when it would happen, and only after a lot of thought and community input. Examples might be friendly competitions or challenges. For instance, we could have an annual “Chapter Preparedness Challenge” where squads collectively try to raise their average Skill Wheel percentage, or maybe issue digital badges for squads that achieve certain group milestones (like 100% of members above 50%). The emphasis would always be on _teamwork and improvement_, not individual bragging rights, in line with the [[Trust Doctrine]] (which cautions against vanity). Any competitive element would be opt-in and framed as a fun way to encourage training (for example, a region might host a “skills weekend” where everyone tries to boost their Navigation by 10%, etc.). The key is that we **never publicly single out individuals in a negative way** – success is celebrated collectively, and competition is used only to the extent that it motivates learning and practice.
