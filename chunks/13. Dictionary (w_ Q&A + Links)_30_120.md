as earlier noted. FPA likely sets progressive goals too: this year, everyone aims to have 1 month of food instead of 2 weeks; by next year, ensure 10% more members get ham licensed; or equip 5 more safe houses regionally. Progress is tracked in meetings without shaming – it’s about encouraging growth. Peer mentoring is used: if one family excels at gardening and another failed at it, pair them up to improve the latter’s success next season. They stay current with external info: monitoring news and emerging threats (cyber, climate, whatever) and adapting plans accordingly. There could be an annual national FPA readiness survey or drill (“National Blackout Weekend”) synchronizing all chapters, which provides a big-picture assessment. Also, members are encouraged to test themselves individually – like go camping with just your go-bag contents to see if you really packed well. Through these practices, FPA creates a feedback loop: Plan -> Practice -> Learn -> Plan better. It’s somewhat military in that continuous improvement ethos, but without the rigidness – it’s driven by each member’s buy-in to be better prepared year after year, with FPA providing structure and motivation.
