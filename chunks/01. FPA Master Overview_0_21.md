E-7 to E-9 (Senior Enlisted): These are the senior enlisted leaders and subject-matter experts. An E-7 might act as a city or county lead, overseeing multiple squads (similar to a Sergeant Major role for that area). E-8 and E-9 are rare and respected; they typically serve on regional councils or head major programs. For instance, an E-9 might be the lead coordinator for the entire communications network in a state, or the chief instructor for the Alliance’s national training center. These individuals have significant AP – representing years of service, high-stakes contributions, and an unimpeachable record of reliability. If an E-9 speaks, even officers listen – because that respect has been earned. Senior enlisted help ensure that top-level decisions make sense on the ground, bridging the gap between grassroots members and the officer leadership.
