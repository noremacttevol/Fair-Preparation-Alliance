- **Onboarding & Probationary Members:** New members start with a **baseline rank** (often called _Probationary Member_ or _Trainee_). This is a getting-to-know-you phase. New folks are warmly welcomed and given basic duties, but initially they won’t hold critical roles or access sensitive info until they’ve proven to be reliable. This acts as a **Trust Firewall** at the membership level – it protects the alliance from bad actors or flaky participation by ensuring that only those who’ve earned trust can move up. New members typically spend a few months training, attending drills, and contributing under the guidance of seasoned members. Think of it as both an onboarding period and a filtering mechanism. _Example:_ In one region, a new volunteer joined just to promote his business; he did minimal work and pushed a personal agenda, so he never moved beyond Probationary. The serious preppers who put in real effort naturally advanced. There’s no exact timetable – it’s about **earning your place** through trust and effort.
