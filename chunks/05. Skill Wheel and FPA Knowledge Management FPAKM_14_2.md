All these offline integration efforts tie back to a central idea: **the Skill Wheel system must remain effective even when the lights go out.** It’s not sufficient to have a flashy app that only works in good times. FPA’s ethos, as reflected in documents like the Trust Doctrine, emphasizes redundancy and reliability. We don’t rely on any single medium or technology. By having both digital and physical (analog) representations of the data, we build confidence that the system is a practical tool under _all_ conditions – not just a tech gimmick. Members will trust the Skill Wheel system more knowing that it won’t abandon them when the internet is down; instead, it has already equipped them with the knowledge and references they need in hand.
