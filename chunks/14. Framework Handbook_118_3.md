**Call to Action:** If you’re reading this as a member of the public or a community leader, we invite you to take these ideas to heart. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel – the FPA framework is here for any community that wants to adopt or adapt it. Start a conversation with your neighbors; form a small squad; build trust by doing a project together (even as simple as creating a shared contact list or running a block party to get to know each other). Use our Trust Doctrine as a guide for that group’s ethos. Try a preparedness drill using ideas from our SOP Compass. Evaluate your neighborhood’s risks and assets as we did, and create your own offline-first solutions. And consider connecting with FPA formally – the Alliance grows through local chapters forming whenever people step up. Real readiness is not proprietary; it’s meant to be shared.  
For FPA members reading this, the journey continues. Mk1Mod3 has set a high bar, but it’s also given us powerful tools. Use this handbook in your training sessions; reference it when updating your local plans; and feel welcome to suggest improvements. Our alliance is only as strong as the collective wisdom and engagement of its members. The doctrine lives through you.
