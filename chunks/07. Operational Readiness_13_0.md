Readiness is a test we quietly take every day, without knowing when the real exam will come. The FPA doesn’t build **theoretical** strength—we relentlessly train for failure so that we can **function under fire**.  
If power dies, _you don’t wait._  
**You activate.**  
If leadership is silent, _you don’t stall._  
**You rotate.**  
We simulate system collapse because that’s the price of real preparedness. The Operational Readiness Doctrine ensures that when the signal drops, your training rises to the occasion.  
> "Don’t panic. Don’t freeze. Flip the page. Pick up the mic. You already trained for this."
