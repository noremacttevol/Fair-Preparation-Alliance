3. **Share a useful tip or resource:** Post at least one actionable preparedness tip, gear review, or useful find to the FPA community (on the app’s forum or at a meeting). For example, maybe you recently tested a cheap water filter – share how it went. Or you found a good deal on bulk first aid supplies – tell others. This isn’t about getting likes; it’s about contributing knowledge from day one. FPA thrives on information sharing, and every member is expected to add to the pool. _(In Phase 1, this could be as simple as bringing up your tip in your squad’s group chat or meeting.)_ By speaking up early, you also signal to everyone that you’re here to participate, not lurk in the shadows.
