Trust is the currency of our organization â€“ without it, the FPA cannot function. Thus, we have codified a **Trust Doctrine** that permeates every aspect of our operations and governance. This doctrine ensures that power is balanced, actions are transparent, and members can place confidence in the system because they can see and verify its integrity. In this section, we detail the Trust Doctrine and the concrete structures (Tribunal, Firewall, Transparency Logs, etc.) that uphold it.
