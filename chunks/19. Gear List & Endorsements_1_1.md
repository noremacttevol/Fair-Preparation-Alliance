**Scope:** This Gear List & Endorsements Doctrine applies to all aspects of how the FPA discovers, tests, endorses, and distributes information about preparedness gear. It integrates with our broader systems – including member trust credits and squad networks – to ensure a consistent approach across the Alliance. From the moment a tip about new gear is dropped by a member, to the day an endorsement badge is awarded (or later withdrawn), this document governs the process. It will eventually nest within the FPA’s Mk1Mod3 compendium of strategic protocols, aligning with all other foundational FPA documents (such as the SHTF Bible and FPA Dictionary). In short, this doctrine tells every member _how we turn truth into a weapon against deception and unfairness in the gear marketplace_.
