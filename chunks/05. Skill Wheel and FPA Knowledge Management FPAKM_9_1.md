All AI-generated scores and suggestions are stored in the Knowledge Management System, and key insights are shared (securely) with the member’s squad leaders or designated mentors. This allows human leadership to **validate and adjust** the AI’s outputs if needed, an important safeguard outlined in the AI reliability plans. For instance, if FPAi suggests a course of action that a seasoned instructor in the field disagrees with, there will be mechanisms for that instructor to provide feedback or override the recommendation with a human judgment call. In effect, we have the AI **augmenting** human decision-making, not replacing it. This combination of AI analytics with human wisdom aims to deliver the best of both worlds, and it will increase member trust in the system’s recommendations. Members will know that there’s always a human in the loop who can clarify or correct the AI as necessary.
