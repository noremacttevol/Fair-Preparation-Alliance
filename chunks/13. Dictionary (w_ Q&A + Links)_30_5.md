Q3: How do FPA members practice OPSEC within the alliance?
A: OPSEC stands for “Operational Security.” In prepping, it means protecting sensitive information about your preparations and plans so that the wrong people don’t find out. Practicing good OPSEC is being careful about who you tell and what you reveal regarding your supplies, location, and capabilities. It’s critical because if others (especially desperate folks or criminals) know you have a big stockpile, you could become a target in a crisis. To maintain OPSEC, preppers store supplies discreetly, keep discussions of their preparations within a trusted circle, and avoid broadcasting their readiness on social media or to casual acquaintances. Even within FPA, members share info under the Trust Doctrine with the understanding it stays private. The bottom line: stay prepared, but keep a low profile. What people don’t know about your readiness won’t hurt you. [#Intermediate] [#Security]
