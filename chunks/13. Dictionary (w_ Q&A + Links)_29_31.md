Q32: Should I include pets in my emergency planning?
A: Yes. If you have pets, you need to account for them just as you would any family member. Disasters can be as dangerous for animals as for humans, and leaving them behind shouldn’t be an option unless it’s absolutely impossible to bring them. In practical terms, including pets in your plans means: store extra pet food and water (at least a few days’ worth, ideally more), have a carrier or leash ready for each pet to transport them safely, and keep copies of veterinary records/vaccinations (some shelters require proof). Plan for where your pets will go if you evacuate – identify pet-friendly shelters or hotels, or friends outside the area who could take them in. Also consider your pet’s specific needs (medications, comfort items) in your go-bag. Bottom line: your animals rely on you, so make sure your prepping covers their survival and comfort too.
