Radio is a linchpin of FPA communications because it works independent of grid infrastructure. All members are encouraged to have at least a simple radio (even if just a hand-held FRS/GMRS walkie-talkie) and learn the basics of its use. Basic radio communication protocols are taught, such as identifying yourself with a call sign or name, using clear language, and the practice of saying “Over” to signify the end of a transmission. Members learn about the range limitations – e.g. that FRS/GMRS is good for local neighborhood use, while ham radio can reach much further especially with repeaters or HF frequencies for long distance. Listening etiquette is also emphasized: always listen before transmitting to avoid stepping on someone else’s message, and keep messages short and focused. FPA provides a simple cheat-sheet of common radio frequencies or channels designated for the group’s use, and what circumstances to use each (for example, Channel 1 might be the primary FRS channel for your chapter, while a certain VHF ham frequency is used for longer-range check-ins). By establishing these basics, even members new to radio can effectively communicate when other methods fail, keeping the group connected.
