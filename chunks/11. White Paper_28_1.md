**Real-World Example:** By 2027, FPA introduced an AI-driven dashboard accessible to regional coordinators. When multiple squads submitted supply needs during a multi-state flood, the AI sorted through the data to highlight patterns (e.g., many requests for water filters) and identified where those were stored or could be procured, even suggesting the closest squad with extras. It flagged that Region 2 had 100 spare filters and Region 4 needed 80, prompting a transfer that might have been missed[fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230907/fema-team-rubicon-sign-agreement-about-preparedness-response-and-recovery#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20increased%20partnership%20and%20collaboration,%E2%80%9D). In terms of oversight, the AI also scanned new FPA policy drafts for jargon or contradictions with our Trust Doctrine, helping polish proposals before humans debated them. It wasn’t perfect, but it saved time and caught details, like pointing out that a planned radio frequency rule conflicted with FCC regulations – something we corrected prior to implementation.
