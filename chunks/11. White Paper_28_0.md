**Description:** Deploy artificial intelligence tools to assist with resource planning, information management, and oversight, while keeping human judgment in charge. This includes using AI to analyze requests and offers across the network to suggest optimal allocation of resources (like matching a surplus of donated food in one region to a shortage in another), moderating internal communications for spam or misinformation, and reviewing proposals/policies for consistency with the Trust Doctrine. The AI acts as an advisor and efficiency booster – an “AI quartermaster and inspector” – but final decisions always rest with human FPA leadership.
