**Deployment and Use:** In practice, an FPA mobile unit might be stored at a squad leader’s home or a central cache, ready to load up at the first hint of trouble. It should be **ready to run at a moment’s notice** – batteries kept charged (or trickle-charged via a solar panel even during storage), and all components packed in a logical, accessible way. The unit is taken along for any field operation, whether it’s a training exercise or a real emergency response. Upon reaching a site, the team establishes a quick “camp”: solar panels laid out facing the sun, antenna mast erected (could be as simple as a telescoping pole or a tree branch for support), and the tablet booted up to check any immediate references (for example, reviewing the _Compass SOPs_ to choose a safe rendezvous point for an evacuation). Within 15 minutes, that team is now an **active node** in the FPA communications network – they can send status updates to other squads or Alliance HQ, receive intel, coordinate actions with neighbors, and tap into a library of offline knowledge if they encounter medical issues or technical problems. Even if completely cut off from higher command, they have guidance at their fingertips (this is how we operationalize the _Offline-First Resilience System_: no team in the field is left helpless just because connectivity to the wider world is lost).
