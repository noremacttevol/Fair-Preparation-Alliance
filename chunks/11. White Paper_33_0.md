**Description:** As multiple countries develop FPA chapters, establish an International Alliance Council with representatives from each national FPA. This council coordinates global strategy, facilitates resource sharing for transnational crises, and ensures the core Trust Doctrine principles remain consistent worldwide, while respecting each nation’s autonomy.
**Real-World Example:** In 2029, FPA’s first International Council meeting included reps from 5 countries. When severe floods struck South Asia that year, the Council quickly organized: the Indian FPA chapter requested water purification units, the US and UK chapters arranged to ship surplus units through military flights, and the Council liaison smoothed customs paperwork. This collective action made a tangible impact, showing the value of a global forum.
**Lessons Learned:** We found the council works best as a facilitator, not a global boss. Cultural differences required sensitivity – decision-making had to be consensus-driven and slow enough to include voices from various time zones. We also learned to formalize how new chapters join and how to mediate disputes (like if two chapters had overlapping regions in expat communities). The experience underscored that our Trust Doctrine needed a global addendum addressing international cooperation and neutrality explicitly.
**Actionable Steps:**  
- Invite each country’s FPA leadership to nominate one representative for the International Council.
