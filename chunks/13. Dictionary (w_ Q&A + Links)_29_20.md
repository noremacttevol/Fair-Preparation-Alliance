Q21: What is the STOP method and how does it help in emergencies?
A: “STOP” is a quick mental checklist to follow when you find yourself in trouble:  
- S = Stop: Stop moving. Don’t panic or run blindly. Take a deep breath and calm down – this prevents rash actions.  
- T = Think: Start thinking clearly about your situation. What’s going on? What problem needs solving first? Recall any training and survival priorities.  
- O = Observe: Look around and assess. What are your surroundings and resources? What’s the weather or time of day? Note any dangers and inventory your gear. Identify shelter options, water sources, or landmarks.  
- P = Plan: Decide on a plan of action based on what you observed. Determine your next steps (stay or move, how to signal for help, how to get water, etc.), then carry it out calmly.  
The STOP method helps you avoid panic and make smarter decisions in an emergency. [#Beginner] [#Skills]
