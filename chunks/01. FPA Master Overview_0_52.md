Community Engagement & Retention: Outreach focuses on building a sense of community both within and around FPA. They organize events that aren’t just training: social gatherings, cross-squad meetups, family picnics – because bonds of friendship strengthen the Alliance and keep people engaged. They might encourage squads to do community service (e.g. volunteering at a soup kitchen or park cleanup while wearing FPA shirts) to show that “preppers” are good neighbors, not doomsday hermits. For internal engagement, they run fun contests or challenges (maybe a photo contest for best organized emergency supply closet, or a referral competition for bringing in new members) to keep members active even when crises are not occurring. Outreach also keeps an eye on member morale – if someone goes quiet or participation drops, they’ll nudge the squad leader to check in, showing that we notice and care about each individual. Their goal is an Alliance that feels like a community, not just an organization.
