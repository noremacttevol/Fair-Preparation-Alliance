Appropriate clothing can mean the difference between comfort and catastrophe, so FPA has guidelines for essential garments and protective gear:  
- Seasonal Clothing: Members maintain sturdy outdoor clothing suitable for their climate: insulated jackets, hats, and gloves for winter; sun hats, light long-sleeve shirts for summer. Rain gear (waterproof jacket, pants, poncho) is must-have to prevent hypothermia or misery during storms. Extra socks (wool or synthetic) are heavily emphasized to keep feet dry and blister-free.  
- Footwear: Broken-in, durable boots or shoes designed for long treks and rough terrain. In every kit, a spare set of socks and even spare shoelaces are packed. If boots get wet, having dry alternates (or at least waterproof gaiters) helps. Some keep compact sneakers or water shoes if needing to cross streams or give feet a break.  
- Work Gloves: Tough gloves for clearing debris, handling hot items, or building shelter â€“ protect against cuts and blisters.  
- Eye Protection: Safety glasses or goggles, especially for those likely to do labor (cutting wood, clearing rubble) or in high-dust scenarios.  
- Masks/Respirators: N95 or better masks in kits for smoke, dust, or disease outbreak. In wildfire-prone areas or urban disaster scenarios, having a half-face respirator with P100 filters is recommended.
