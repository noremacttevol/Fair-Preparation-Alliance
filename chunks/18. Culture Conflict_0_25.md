Conflict Reporting Channels: In addition to informal communication, FPA provides formal channels for raising issues, especially for sensitive matters or if normal attempts fail. One channel is via the Trust Liaison – any member can approach their Trust Liaison confidentially to discuss a conflict or concern, no matter how minor or major. The Liaison can then advise on next steps, help the person prepare for a direct conversation, or escalate the issue if it’s severe. Another channel is an anonymous feedback system (e.g., an online form or suggestion box) where members can report concerns about team dynamics, misconduct, or any breach of our values. While direct, open communication is preferred, we recognize some situations (like power differentials or fear of retaliation) may make anonymity useful; the Culture & Resilience Committee monitors these submissions and addresses them appropriately. We also maintain a whistleblower policy: if someone witnesses serious unethical behavior or abuse of power, they can report it safely without fear – such reports will be handled with discretion and taken seriously by an impartial body.
