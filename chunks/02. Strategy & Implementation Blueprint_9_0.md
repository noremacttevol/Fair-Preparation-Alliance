**Objective:** Transform a new recruit into a baseline competent FPA member within a squad setting.  
When someone first joins FPA, they enter Phase I – Onboarding. In this phase:  
- **Assignment & Mentorship:** The new member is assigned to a squad (if possible, one with experienced members) and paired with a mentor (often a squad leader or senior member). This mentor is responsible for guiding them through initial training.  
- **Core Training:** Phase I members complete the **Basic Training Module** outlined in the Compass Guide. This includes learning FPA’s mission and values, the Trust Doctrine basics, personal preparedness fundamentals, and how to use the FPA App and equipment. They also learn the squad’s internal protocols and get a copy of the Compass Guide.  
- **Shadowing & Support Role:** New onboarders typically take a support role in squad activities. They might observe more than lead during initial drills. For example, in a drill they could be tasked with checklist ticking or assisting another member, rather than leading a task. This gives them exposure without overwhelming responsibility.
