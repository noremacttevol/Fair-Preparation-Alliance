- **The “Outernet” Broadcasts:** In a grid-down scenario, we cannot rely on the internet or cellular networks. FPA has planned for an **Outernet** – a one-way or limited two-way information pipeline that does not depend on local connectivity. For example, FPA might partner with services like **Othernet (formerly Outernet)** to broadcast emergency data via satellite to small receiver kits on the ground ([Outernet, it's not about You!. Stumbling about through various tech ...](https://medium.com/@w9bed_bryan/outernet-its-not-about-you-9658a3db0aae#:~:text=,and%20display%20the%20%E2%80%9C)) ([Amateur radio emergency communications - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_emergency_communications#:~:text=In%20times%20of%20crisis%20and,conventional%20means%20of%20communications%20fail)). Prior to crises, we will have distributed or advised on these simple satellite data receivers (or even cheap satellite radios) to our squads and possibly sympathetic community centers. When the disaster happens, we can uplink critical packets: text emergency bulletins, maps, supply locations, or even PDFs of our micro-guides, and they will be beamed down to any receivers in the region. This is essentially a modern version of broadcast radio, but with digital content that can be stored and forwarded. It serves as a **fall-back** when internet-based comms fail. We will have a protocol for what gets sent: likely a periodic “information dump” at set intervals (e.g., top of every hour)
