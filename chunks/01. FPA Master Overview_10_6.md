- **Liaison with Media and Authorities:** Comms & Outreach serve as the **liaison point** for media inquiries and relationships with authorities or other organizations from a communications standpoint. For example, if a city’s emergency management wants to incorporate FPA in a drill, the Outreach team will coordinate the PR around it and ensure it aligns with our image. They might prepare press releases about major milestones (like “FPA reaches 20k members, implements novel dynamic funding model”). If a crisis occurs and FPA responds, they may arrange for spokespeople to talk to local news, to highlight the good work and potentially recruit more help. They maintain a **roster of media-trained members** who can articulate our mission well on camera or radio without spilling sensitive info. Likewise, for law enforcement or government relations, they ensure we’re known as **allies** not adversaries – emphasizing our oversight and ethical stance to alleviate any concerns that we’re vigilantes.
