In summary, these external analogues provided both **validation and warnings** for our project. They validated that tracking multi-faceted competency is a proven approach in high-stakes fields – militaries do it, hospitals do it, etc. – and that a well-rounded readiness profile is achievable and desirable. They also reinforced key design elements: no critical zeroes (military cross-training), mix knowledge with demonstration (healthcare), structured progression (scouting/SCUBA/martial arts), and smart use of visualization and motivation (corporate radar charts, gamified apps). At the same time, they warned us of the dangers of box-checking, vanity metrics, and false senses of accomplishment. By internalizing those lessons, we’ve built the FPA Skill Wheel to be **grounded in reality and truly beneficial** for preparing our members, rather than being just an app gimmick.
