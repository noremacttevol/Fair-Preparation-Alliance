Beyond information security, FPA also prepares physical security plans to protect members and resources. Preppers understand that in a severe crisis, threats from looters or desperate mobs are possible, so the Alliance incorporates collective defense strategies (always ethically and legally grounded). Home and Retreat Security: In Phase 1, members harden their homes or agreed safe locations: reinforcing doors, having contingency lighting (like motion sensor lights or solar lights) to deter intruders, and perhaps creating layered defenses (thorny bushes under windows, etc.). The [[Approved Gear List Overview]] includes security items like quality locks, alarms (including low-tech tripwire noise makers), and personal defense tools. Members often help each other with security audits of homes. Mutual Defense Pacts: FPA chapters develop a plan that if one memberâ€™s location comes under threat, nearby members will come to assist if feasible. For example, a neighborhood watch-style rotation might be instituted in Phase 2 where members take turns patrolling the area at night in teams. They might use whistles or radios to call for backup from each other if something is amiss. Safe Zones and Perimeters: If the chapter consolidates to a group shelter or base (say several families move into one farm or building for better defense), they establish a perimeter. This could involve setting up obstacles (vehicles, barricades) at key entry points, laying out fields of view for surveillance, and
