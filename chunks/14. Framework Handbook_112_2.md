In summary, through approved gear standards and a fair pricing model, FPA ensures that **what you have** is less dependent on **what you can pay** and more on **what you need and contribute**. This way, preparedness becomes a shared endeavor, not a commodity race. We turn gear and supplies into a collective safety net, reinforcing that in a true alliance, _everyoneâ€™s resilience is tied together_.
