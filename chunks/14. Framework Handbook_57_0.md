Trust is the glue that holds any community together, especially in a crisis. The **FPA Trust Doctrine** is a formal set of principles and commitments designed to strengthen that glue within our Alliance. It evolved out of necessity â€“ while Mk1Mod2 relied on an unspoken understanding among members, Mk1Mod3 makes trust explicit, teachable, and non-negotiable.
