- **Message Handling and Logging:** Operators in Phase 2 learn how to formally handle messages. This includes writing down incoming messages with time stamps, and using message forms for relaying critical info (like casualty reports or supply requests) so that nothing is forgotten or mis-transcribed. They also practice sending written messages via radio (often using brevity codes to shorten and reduce errors). They might act as a secretary for a net in some drills, logging everything said – an invaluable skill when chaos is high.  
- **Encryption Basics (if applicable):** Depending on Alliance policy and legal constraints, Phase 2 may introduce simple field cipher systems or code words for sensitive info. Even if we generally operate in the clear (as HAM often requires by law), teams can use prearranged code phrases for certain situations (e.g., “Compass Rose” might mean “fall back to secondary rendezvous”). Phase 2 members memorize and practice these so that in a real event, operational security (OPSEC) is maintained. Trust Doctrine is tied in: encryption or codes should never be used to deceive within the Alliance, only to protect information from adversaries.
