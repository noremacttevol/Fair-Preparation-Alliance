- **Community Workshops and Partnerships:** Face-to-face outreach is a powerful pre-crisis tool. FPA squads in various regions host regular meetups, workshops, and training sessions: e.g., monthly “Prepper Potlucks” where families share preparedness tips over a meal, or “Skill Saturdays” where a practical skill (firemaking, first aid, HAM radio basics) is taught by an expert. We provide our local squad leaders with presentation kits and printed materials to run these sessions (again emphasizing decentralized execution of a centralized doctrine). We also partner with existing community organizations – for example, a neighborhood association, a church, or a school – offering to co-host an emergency drill or give a guest lecture on disaster prep. This ingrains FPA’s presence at the grassroots level. Every one of these events is an opportunity to recruit more volunteers and identify potential leaders who resonate with our mission.
