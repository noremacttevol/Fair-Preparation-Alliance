Q17: Should I tell people that I'm prepping? How to handle OPSEC?
A: Be careful about who you tell. In general, it’s wise to keep your prepping private (this is called OPSEC – operational security). If everyone knows you have supplies, you could become a target during a crisis for those who didn’t prepare. You don’t want acquaintances or neighbors thinking of your home as the local emergency pantry. However, that doesn’t mean you should never tell anyone. It can be beneficial to confide in a few trusted people – for example, close family or friends who might join you in prepping. Building a small group or mutual agreement with trusted neighbors can enhance your safety. The key is to use discretion: share your plans only with people you trust deeply and who have a reason to know, and keep a low profile with everyone else. [#Beginner] [#Security]
