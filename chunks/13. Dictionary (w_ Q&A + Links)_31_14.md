Q5: How does FPA ensure AI used in planning doesn’t misguide them?
A: FPA, being cautious, sets up a system of human oversight for any AI tools they use in planning or decision support (like scenario simulations or knowledge management). They treat AI as an assistant, not an authority.Q5: How does FPA ensure AI used in planning doesn’t misguide them?
A: FPA uses AI as a tool, not a decision-maker, and always keeps humans in the loop. Any AI-generated suggestions (for scenarios, logistics, etc.) are reviewed by experienced members before being adopted. They validate AI outputs against real-world data and FPA’s principles – if something seems off or contrary to common sense, they investigate instead of blindly trusting it. FPA likely curates what data the AI uses (to avoid bad info) and even runs multiple models for cross-checks. The “AI Reliability & Oversight” guidelines ensure that critical plans aren’t based solely on AI: there’s always a human verification step and often a discussion or tabletop exercise to confirm. In summary, AI can crunch numbers or offer ideas quickly, but FPA relies on human judgment to approve and implement any plan. This balances innovation with caution. [#Advanced] [#Technology]
