- _Mentorship Network:_ Develop a bench of experienced members who can act as traveling trainers. As your squad matures, some members might take on regional roles – visiting other communities, speaking at town halls about FPA, and guiding nascent groups. Essentially, create a **mentorship network** where each established squad “adopts” a developing squad. Over time, a mentorship tree emerges, ensuring knowledge flows outward without all coming from a central authority (truly decentralized scaling). An FPA Compass Guide appendix could list mentor contacts by region, once there are enough squads – contribute your squad’s info when ready.  
- _Onboarding Automation:_ As membership grows (both within a squad and across new squads), automate repetitive onboarding tasks. Example: set up an online form for sign-ups that feeds into a spreadsheet, auto-send new volunteers a welcome email with key docs (squad charter, meeting schedule, link to FPA Dictionary). Use free tools like Google Forms or Airtable for this. Some FPA pilots created a simple chatbot for Facebook/WhatsApp that would provide interested people with info and next steps automatically. Automation saves leader time and gives a consistent introduction for everyone. Also consider creating short tutorial videos for new members (perhaps hosted on a free platform) so they can self-learn basics (“How to use our squad radio in 5 minutes,” etc.). This way scaling up doesn’t overburden the core team.
