- **Mandatory Transparency Logs for Vendor Interactions:** Every interaction that could even remotely influence gear endorsements must be logged. This includes communications with vendors (meetings, calls, emails), receipt of test samples or donations, offers of discounts, etc. The log entry should detail **who, when, what was discussed/offered, and outcome**. These logs are accessible to members (member-only if sensitive, but available for internal scrutiny). There is a zero-tolerance policy on secret deals; even the appearance of secrecy can damage trust. If a member is found to have had an undisclosed meeting or gift from a vendor related to endorsements, that is grounds for investigation. We prefer to err on the side of over-reporting – even a vendor sending a thank-you note after an endorsement should be logged (“Company X thanked us on 2025-07-01, no requests or offers made”). Transparency is a disinfectant; by shining light on all interactions, we keep everyone honest.
