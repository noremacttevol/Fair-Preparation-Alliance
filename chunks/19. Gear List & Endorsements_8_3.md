- **Physical Gear Audit Journals:** While we maintain digital logs of gear tests, we also encourage a physical record-keeping practice. Each squad (and often individual members) keeps a **Gear Audit Journal** – a bound notebook or durable ledger – where they record maintenance checks, test dates, and outcomes for gear. This can be as simple as a checklist of “Inspected generator spark plugs – OK” or a full page report of “Tested tent in rain – minor leak at seam”. Appendix A provides a sample template for how to structure these entries for consistency. The reason for a physical journal is twofold: reliability and habit. Paper doesn’t crash or lose data in an EMP event; it’s always accessible. Moreover, the act of writing in a log builds a culture of routine checks and accountability. Journal entries are periodically photocopied or scanned during normal times and uploaded to the FPA database (so we can aggregate long-term performance data), but the physical copy stays with the squad as a master record. In a scenario where communications go dark, each community still has its own reference of what gear has been tested, fixed, or is due for replacement.
