If someone asks why they have so much food stored, they might say they bulk-buy to save money or run a pantry for charity. If asked about group meetings, they could describe it as a camping/outdoors club. This way, they don’t advertise FPA but also don’t appear secretive, which could arouse suspicion. Discretion in Public – When conducting training exercises or meet-ups, OPSEC means doing so without drawing undue attention. A firearms training might just look like a normal day at the shooting range, a radio drill might occur on ham frequencies blending in with normal traffic, a group hike could just look recreational. Any overt discussion of SHTF scenarios is kept within private settings. Secure Storage of Documents – Physical and digital documents (membership lists, plans) are protected. Printed docs are kept in locked containers (and often in duplicate in separate locations in case one is lost). Digital files are encrypted, perhaps with tools that all members are taught to use. The Realnet itself is designed with security in mind – it may use encrypted messaging boards accessible only to members with login tokens, possibly even running on a darknet or closed network to avoid external observation.
