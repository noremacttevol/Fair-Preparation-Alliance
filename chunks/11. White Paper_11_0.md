**Description:** Ensure each Regional Relay Squad has skilled communications operators by recruiting and training at least one dedicated **HAM radio** lead (and deputies) per region. This milestone focuses on building human capacity – knowledgeable radio operators and tech specialists – to run the national network. With formal training, licensing, and practice, these regional comm leads become the linchpins of FPA’s decentralized communication, able to keep information flowing when conventional channels fail.
**Real-World Example:** In 2024, FPA’s Northeast region hosted a HAM “boot camp” weekend. Volunteers from five states came together to study for their FCC exams and practice on-air protocols. The result: 15 new licensed operators across the region, directly feeding the ranks of regional communications leads.
