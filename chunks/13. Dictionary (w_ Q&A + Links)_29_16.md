Q16: How can I prep on a tight budget? It seems expensive.
A: Prepping doesn’t have to be expensive. Start with the most critical needs and use low-cost methods. For water, you can store tap water in clean containers for almost free. For food, buy a few extra non-perishable items each grocery trip – canned goods and rice are cheap and add up over time. Prioritize inexpensive essentials like flashlights, batteries, and first aid supplies (often found at dollar stores). Use thrift shops or garage sales for gear (like backpacks, blankets, tools) instead of buying new. Learn skills through free online resources or community workshops rather than paying for fancy courses. The key is consistency: small purchases and improvements each week. Even on a tight budget, you can build a solid emergency stockpile by planning carefully and avoiding overpriced “tactical” gadgets you don’t actually need. [#Beginner] [#Financial]
