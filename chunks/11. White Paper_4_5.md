- **Emergency Before Completion:** Perhaps the most critical contingency: what if a disaster strikes before Phase1 is fully done for someone? In other words, you’re only halfway prepared when the real test comes. The plan here is **“any preparation is better than none.”** Even if you haven’t hit every target, use what you have. For instance, if a member hasn’t gotten a HAM license yet when a hurricane hits, they should still use whatever radio they have legally (if life-and-death, in the US even unlicensed use on HAM frequencies can be tolerated under distress). Or if you only have 1 week of food instead of 2, ration immediately and coordinate with neighbors – perhaps others have extra. Phase1 sets ideals, but reality might cut in line. So we encourage a mindset of improvisation: use the training you do have, adapt the tools you do have. The network (Phase3) will eventually be there, but in the immediate, fall back on personal ingenuity and any local contacts (proto-squads). After the event, learn from it – your post-mortem experience will be priceless input to improving this roadmap.
