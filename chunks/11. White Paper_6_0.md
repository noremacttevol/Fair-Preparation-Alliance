1. **Milestone 1: Grassroots Recruitment Drive**  
- _Real-World Example:_ After Hurricane Sandy, a group of NYC activists launched “Occupy Sandy” and rapidly mobilized ~60,000 volunteers through social media and local churches ([Ten Years Ago, Occupy Sandy Didn’t Just Help New Yorkers, It Redefined Disaster Response | THE CITY — NYC News](https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/10/28/ten-years-occupy-sandy-disaster-response/#:~:text=Based%20on%20relationships%20forged%20and,and%20even%20help%20rebuild%20homes)). They simply put out the call for help, and people showed up in droves. This showed that in crises, ordinary people **will** volunteer if asked and organized.  
- _Lessons Learned:_ Don’t wait for perfect conditions – **start recruiting now**. Occupy Sandy’s success came from existing community networks and the urgency of a crisis. A proactive squad can’t rely on spontaneous turnout alone; it must recruit before a disaster. Leverage any local group or prior connections (PTAs, faith groups, hobby clubs) to find willing hands. **Lesson:** When neighbors know and trust you beforehand, they respond faster and more reliably during an emergency.  
- _Action Steps:_  
- Map out community hotspots: markets, schools, events – places to meet potential volunteers.  
- Create a simple pitch (flyer or 2-minute spiel) explaining FPA’s mission and why a local squad matters. Emphasize protecting _our_ neighborhood.
