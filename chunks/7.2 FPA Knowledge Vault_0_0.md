The FPA Knowledge Vault is a centralized, curated repository of the Alliance’s accumulated wisdom, plans, and references – essentially the brain of the group. It’s organized as a digital library (often using systems like Obsidian or a private wiki) that contains everything from emergency plans and checklists to how-to guides and past incident debriefs. Each member has access to the vault (or at least the portions relevant to them), and key portions are also kept in printed form or on durable media in case digital access fails. The vault is structured in a Zettelkasten-like manner with notes that are densely interlinked (e.g., a note on “Generator Maintenance” will link to “Fuel Storage” and “Power Management” notes, etc.), enabling quick navigation of related topics. Categories cover areas like Communication (the very notes we’re compiling here), First Aid, Security, Logistics, etc., and within those, numbered notes (for example, this combined file eventually splits into such notes). There’s also a section for official documents: PDFs from FEMA, Red Cross manuals, local evacuation maps – so members can find authoritative info easily. What makes the vault especially useful is that it’s maintained – outdated info is flagged and updated, new insights from drills or actual emergencies are added (see [[3.19 Continuous Improvement]]).
