**Why it was created (problem it solves):** An EMP attack or severe solar storm could instantly knock out unprotected electronics, cutting off coordination when we’d need it most. Traditional networks (cell towers, internet) would fail, leaving communities isolated. This initiative was born to **ensure FPA’s lifeline communications survive “worst-case” grid-down scenarios**, keeping members connected and informed. By EMP-hardening devices, we solve the vulnerability of our comms going dark when SHTF. *Faraday cages protect electronic devices from EMPs, so communication and navigation tools remain functional during emergencies ([The Ultimate Guide to Faraday Cages for EMP Protection

**What’s already implemented (current wins):** The FPA Tech Squad has built and distributed portable Faraday kits to all chapter leads – essentially small duffel-sized Faraday cages that can hold radios, USB drives, and flashlights. In our recent drill, every participating squad successfully transmitted status updates on shortwave radios that had been stored in these cages during an EMP simulation ([The Ultimate Guide to Faraday Cages for EMP Protection
