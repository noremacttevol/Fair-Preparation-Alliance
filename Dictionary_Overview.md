‚úÖ [[FPA Dictionary]] System Overview ‚Äì MK1MOD2 
 
üéØ Purpose: 
The [[FPA Dictionary]] is a comprehensive, community-driven resource designed to provide 
definitions, explanations, and context for all terms, actions, roles, tools, and structures within the 
Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA). It serves as the central knowledge system for explaining FPA 
processes to all members at all levels of experience. 
‚óè Accessibility: Linked throughout the app, this dictionary ensures that no one has to rely 
on external sources. 
 
‚óè Collaboration: All entries are community-driven, allowing members to edit, vote, and 
provide feedback. 
 
‚óè Clarity: Provides primary and expanded definitions, offering depth for both beginners 
and experts. 
 
 
‚úÖ How the Dictionary Works: 
Every key term or action in the FPA app links to the Dictionary, allowing users to access 
definitions and explanations tailored to their level of experience. The Dictionary serves as an 
interactive knowledge web, offering: 
‚óè Primary Explanations: A simple definition of the term. 
 
‚óè Expanded Explanations: In-depth explanations for those seeking more context. 
 
‚óè Cross-links: Connections to other related terms, tools, and concepts for further 
exploration. 
 
For example, when a user encounters "[[Pulse Test]]," they can click on the term to be redirected 
to a detailed explanation within the Dictionary. The entry will also offer links to related terms like 
"[[HAM Radio]]" and "EMP Protection". 
 
‚úÖ Why We Use Links, Not Over-Explanation: 
Instead of overloading the app with information, the [[FPA Dictionary]] leverages links to provide 
a seamless way for users to explore related concepts. When users click on a term: 
‚óè They can access a dynamic web of answers, further explanations, and related terms. 
 
‚óè It helps keep the app clean and user-friendly, offering endless depth for users to explore 
at their own pace. 
 
‚óè Links can guide users towards more advanced explanations or the [[Compass Guide]] for 
motivational or strategic insights when needed. 
 
 
üö´ What the Dictionary Is Not: 
The [[FPA Dictionary]] is focused solely on explaining terms, processes, and concepts‚Äîit does 
not provide: 
‚óè Motivational content: This role is reserved for the [[Compass Guide]], which addresses 
the personal growth journey of FPA members. 
 
‚óè Emotional guidance: For more personal, development-oriented insights, users are 
directed to the [[Compass Guide]]. 
 
 
üõ† Dictionary Infrastructure: 
‚óè Tags: Each dictionary entry is tagged by its function (e.g., communications, defense, first 
aid) and complexity level (e.g., Basic, Intermediate, Expert). 
 
‚óè Community Contributions: 
 
‚óã Proposing Entries: Members can suggest new terms or concepts for review. 
 
‚óã Editing Entries: Suggested changes are discussed and tracked for 
transparency. 
 
‚óã Voting on Changes: Entries require a majority vote from active members for 
changes to be implemented, fostering a democratic and trust-building system. 
 
 
üí¨ Examples of How It Feeds Other Tools: 
The [[FPA Dictionary]] is integrated seamlessly into FPA tools and communication methods: 
1. [[FPAi]]: The chatbot pulls explanations from dictionary entries, ensuring context-aware 
responses based on a user‚Äôs query. 
 
2. [[Squad]] Tools: Tooltips within squad tools link directly to relevant dictionary entries to 
clarify terms. 
 
3. [[Test My Plan]]: Feedback from [[Test My Plan]] will link to terms in the dictionary to help 
clarify concepts. 
 
4. [[Compass Guide]]: For deeper, more motivational insights, the [[Compass Guide]] is linked 
for high-level guidance. 
 
 
‚úÖ Outcome: 
The [[FPA Dictionary]] is the backbone of FPA's knowledge ecosystem. It provides members with: 
‚óè Clear and consistent definitions for every concept, tool, or process in FPA. 
 
‚óè Community-driven improvements with feedback, editing, and voting mechanisms, 
ensuring that the information is relevant, up-to-date, and reflective of the collective 
wisdom of the community. 
 
‚óè A single source of truth for terminology and processes, ensuring consistency and 
clarity across the entire FPA system. 
 
 
‚úÖ Suggested Refinements: 
To make the [[FPA Dictionary]] even more aligned with FPA‚Äôs vision: 
1. Clarify Community Contribution Process: 
 
‚óã Proposing Entries: Members can submit new terms or revisions via a form, 
which is reviewed by the community. 
 
‚óã Editing Entries: Proposals are discussed and tracked transparently for 
community feedback. 
 
‚óã Voting Mechanism: New and revised entries are voted on by active members to 
ensure consensus and integrity. 
 
2. Include an Example User Journey: 
 
‚óã Example: A user clicks on "[[Pulse Test]]," which links to an explanation of the term 
and related terms like "[[HAM Radio]]" and "EMP Protection." This allows users to 
navigate easily between related concepts. 
 
3. Emphasize Single Source of Truth: 
 
‚óã The [[FPA Dictionary]] should be clearly described as the single source of truth 
for FPA terminology and processes, ensuring consistency and clarity across the 
app. 
 
4. Ensure Accessibility: 
 
‚óã Definitions should cater to all levels of experience: Basic, Intermediate, and 
Expert users. Each term should provide a primary explanation with options for 
further detail, allowing users to learn at their own pace. 
 
5. Reiterate the Distinction from [[Compass Guide]]: 
 
‚óã The [[FPA Dictionary]] is not motivational. For personal growth, members are 
directed to the [[Compass Guide]], which provides guidance on development and 
progression within FPA. 
 
6. Integration with [[FPAi]] and [[Compass Guide]]: 
 
‚óã If a user‚Äôs question isn‚Äôt fully answered by the dictionary, [[FPAi]] will provide 
additional context or direct the user to relevant sections of the [[Compass Guide]] 
for deeper insight.
