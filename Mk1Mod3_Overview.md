## Purpose
Mk1Mod3 serves as the **operational compass** for the Fair Preparation Alliance (FPA). It consolidates prior work, removes ambiguity, and delivers a modular, reference-driven playbook aligned with both internal SOPs and external partnership needs.

## Objectives
- **Unify** fragmented guidance from Mk1Mod2, Compass SOPs, and User Inflow documents
- **Clarify** strategic priorities and member-facing messaging
- **Enable** autonomous execution by team members and advisors
- **Align** future documents and operations with intentional design

---

## Structure of Mk1Mod3 (Planned Modules)
1. **Executive Summary**
   - What FPA does, who it serves, how it wins
   - Situational awareness + core values

2. **User Inflow Framework**
   - Decision trees, pathways, onboarding logic
   - Diagrams for different member/partner types

3. **Strategic SOPs**
   - Clear, modular procedures for all key functions
   - Linked references to Dictionary, App White Paper, and Org Structure

4. **Reference Index**
   - Glossary, role map, key links
   - Long-form sources: Book, Q&A base, legacy archives

---

## Strategic Notes
- Redundancy from older modules (Mod2) is being phased out or absorbed into this structure.
- This module is designed for **rapid updates** and **future adaptability**.
- All language here should be **precise**, **actionable**, and **audience-aware**.

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Extract and rewrite critical SOPs into Module 3 structure
- [ ] Map user inflow with diagrams and conditional prompts
- [ ] Align Module 3 language with Compass Guide principles
- [ ] Backlink relevant legacy content for future traceability
