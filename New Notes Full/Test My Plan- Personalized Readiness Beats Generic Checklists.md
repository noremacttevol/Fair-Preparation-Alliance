## Executive Snapshot

Generic supply lists lull people into a false sense of security—more than __51 % of Americans say they’re “prepared,” yet barely a third have a family plan and only 12 % have talked to neighbors about disasters_ [Risk and Resilience Hub](https://www.riskandresiliencehub.com/are-americans-prepared-for-disasters-femas-survey-reveals-key-findings/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)_. FPA’s **Test-My-Plan (TMP)** flips that script with a five-minute, AI-guided assessment that turns individual blind spots into clear next steps—all synced to the **Skill Wheel**, **Realnet** drills, and the offline **SHTF Bible**.

## 1 | Why Generic Checklists Fail

|Pain Point|Evidence|Why TMP Solves It|
|---|---|---|
|“One-size-fits-all” lists ignore local risk|FEMA itself calls its own kit list “only a starting point” that must be tailored to every family [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/community-resilience/planning-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)|TMP’s onboarding asks about your hazards, household size, pets, and mobility needs.|
|Communities that skip risk-based planning pay the highest recovery costs|NIST’s Community Resilience Guide shows cookie-cutter plans lengthen recovery timelines and inflate rebuild budgets [Deloitte United States](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/automation-and-generative-ai-in-government/leveraging-ai-in-emergency-management-and-crisis-response.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)|TMP weights factors that most affect survival—supplies 30 %, plans 25 %, skills 20 %, comms 15 %, home safety 10 %.|
|At-risk groups are under-served by blanket messaging|Deloitte’s 2023 brief urges agencies to personalize guidance with AI [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/teaching-kids-about-emergency-preparedness/how-schools-can-prepare-for-emergencies.html?srsltid=AfmBOooAYcWS3JBMA5r8ID4N_j_v_UU1N_Qt5fYz4R9Wacm74omGJ3Rg&utm_source=chatgpt.com)|TMP delivers a ranked to-do list and gear links matched to your answers.|

## 4 | Transparency & Alignment with FPA Doctrine

- **Open Algorithm** – Weightings published; members can propose adjustments at the quarterly Governance Forum.
    
- **Skill Wheel Sync** – TMP gaps feed straight into the Skill Wheel so progress is visible and gamified—not fear-based.
    
- **Privacy First** – Answers stay client-side until the member opts-in to share aggregated stats for community Pulse Tests.
