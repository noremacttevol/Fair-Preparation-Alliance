How Realnet and Outernet Keep You Informed When the Grid Fail
## 1. Why an offline plan matters now

### Doctrine link

FPA anticipated this in the **Offline-First Resilience System**: every critical tool must work with zero internet by default [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/16sndpl/a_more_practicalpersonal_example_of_emergency/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 2. Why cell phones and social media are not enough

During a routine fiber cut in rural America, 911 calls failed and residents lost service all night . If a simple backhoe can isolate a county, imagine a regional grid failure. Traditional guidance—“wait for text alerts”—assumes towers, power, and backbone fiber all survive. Our doctrine rejects that single-point-of-failure model .

## 3. The FPA Offline-First Resilience Stack

### 3.1 Realnet – the nightly radio backbone

- **Frequency:** 7.200 MHz voice net, clear-channel after sunset .
    
- **Hardware:** Handheld or mobile HAM rigs stored in Faraday cages when not in use .
    
- **Practice:** Weekly “Pulse Tests” log check-ins and relay drills to keep skill rust away.

### 3.2 Outernet – local info loops & mesh

- **30-minute bulletin loops:** Pre-recorded regional podcasts on USB sticks replayed over low-power FM or LoRa, covering weather, aid points, and FPA updates.
    
- **Ad-hoc mesh nodes:** Battery-backed Wi-Fi or LoRa repeaters pass text packets peer-to-peer—no servers required [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2023-134/pdfs/2023-134revised062023.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Content parity:** Every Outernet loop carries the same vetted data you would see in-app, keeping doctrine consistent.
    

### 3.3 Print & Sneakernet – the “SHTF Bible” layer

- **Durable knowledge cards**: Waterproof, modular pages covering water, first aid, navigation .
    
- **USB “seed drives”:** Encrypted archives of docs travel by hand between squad meet-ups (the classic sneakernet) 00. FPA-combined.

## 4. Proof that it works

- **Maria 2017:** ARRL/Red Cross teams restored message flow in Puerto Rico hospitals via HF relays 00. FPA-combined.
    
- **Community drills:** An Ohio FPA squad used Realnet radios to coordinate food runs during a 12-hour blackout—no panic, no missed meds 00. FPA-combined.
    
- **Academic backing:** NIOSH finds retention jumps when training is competency-mapped and repeatedly drilled—exactly the function of our Skill Wheel + Pulse Tests 00. FPA-combined.

## 5. Member action steps (do these this week)

1. **Download & print** the “72-Hour Comms Cheat-Sheet” from the member portal (links inside the SHTF Bible kit).
    
2. **Join tonight’s Realnet net** on 7.200 MHz at 21:00 EST—log your first call sign check-in.
    
3. **Record a 60-second local Outernet segment**: neighborhood status, water lines, or road closures—upload at next squad meet.
    
4. **Run _Test-My-Plan_** for comms gaps; the AI will flag missing radio gear or battery depth SHTF_Bible_and_Skills_T….

## 6. What’s next—turn drills into rank

Our next article will show how Realnet check-ins feed the **Skill Wheel**, letting members progress from E-1 Listener to E-3 Relay Operator and beyond—all transparent in the Mk1 Mod 3 rank matrix Why_FPA_MK1MOD2_Public.

### Closing thought

Staying informed shouldn’t depend on fragile infrastructure. By weaving **Realnet, Outernet, and print** into one mesh of human-powered reliability, FPA gives every member—and the communities they love—the confidence that someone, somewhere, will still be on the air when the lights go out.
