**Flagship Feature #1 – The FPA Trust Doctrine**  
_(for Bubble-app devs, content editors, and QA auditors)_

---

## 0 | Why this matters (30-sec brief)

Blind trust breaks; bureaucracy stalls. A **rule-based, fully auditable trust stack** lets FPA scale safely while proving our charter values—decentralization, transparency, merit. Zero-trust frameworks cut security breaches, while public-ledger charity pilots reduce fraud inquiries by 75 % ([Home | CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/01/22/state-of-zero-trust-across-industries?utm_source=chatgpt.com "State of Zero Trust Across Industries | CSA - Cloud Security Alliance"), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380671247_Transparent_Charity_Application_and_Crowdfunding_Using_Blockchain?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Transparent Charity Application and Crowdfunding Using Blockchain")).

## 2 | System architecture (developer-ready)

```
[Client] --> Bubble.io Front-end
   |                 |
   | GraphQL (auth)  | REST (ledger)
[AuthN/AuthZ] <----> [Ledger API] <----> [PostgreSQL + Hash-chain]
   | MFA, SCIM       | append-only tx   |
   |                 V                  |
   |            [Trust Graph]           |
   |                 ↑ Neo4j            |
   +--> S3 (evidence blobs)             |
                       ↑                |
              AI-Explain API ---------->+
```

- **Zero-Trust Gatekeeper** – Cloudflare Access in front of Bubble; RBAC + MFA.
    
- **Ledger API** – All writes append SHA-256 hash; daily Merkle root hashed to Arweave.
    
- **Trust Graph** – Neo4j node types: `Member`, `Badge`, `Vote`, `Alert`.
    
- **Explainable-AI Wrapper** – Every Gen-AI response returns JSON `{answer, sources[], confidence}`.

## 3 | User stories & UX flow

1. **New joiner creates account** → Gatekeeper issues temp “Outer-Circle” role (read-only).
    
2. **Completes Probation Drill** → Bubble workflow calls `POST /badges` → Trust Graph adds `Drill:Pass`.
    
3. **Two peers endorse** → Role promoted to “Inner-Circle”; UI shows green firewall ring.
    
4. **Any member spots issue** → clicks _Flag_ → `POST /alerts`; squad vote auto-starts.
    
5. **Vote-to-Zero passes** → Ledger records revocation; role set to “Suspended”.

## 6 | Governance & maintenance

- **Quarterly Trust-Failure Simulation** – scripted scenario to test Vote-to-Zero.
    
- **AI Audit log review** – align with CAQ guidance every 90 days.
    
- **Member feedback loop** – likes + comments feed into backlog; highest-liked suggestion wins sprint slot.

### Closing nudge

Ship the **Trust Doctrine** article and backing features first; nothing else proves FPA’s promise faster. With a live ledger, badge firewall, and community veto in plain sight, every new feature (Dynamic Pricing, Skill Wheel…) inherits a foundation members can believe in—and verify.
