## Executive snapshot

Generic preparedness lists tell you **what** to buy but not **where you’re weak**. The FPA **Skill Wheel** turns abstract competencies into a living dashboard: a circular chart that shows your strongest slices, weakest slivers, and the exact drill or lesson to level up next. Competency-mapping research shows visual dashboards drive higher retention and faster gap closure than text-only checklists ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2569994/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Competency Mapping and Analysis for Public Health Preparedness ..."), [Esri](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/ops-dashboard/decision-support/dashboards-for-emergency-response/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Dashboards for Emergency Response - Esri")).

## 1 Why visualizing skills beats reading lists

### 1.1 Competency dashboards accelerate learning

- Competency-mapping projects in public-health preparedness improved training follow-through by 24 % when learners could see a color-coded progress wheel ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2569994/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Competency Mapping and Analysis for Public Health Preparedness ...")).
    
- FEMA’s hazard-mitigation Tableau dashboards prove that “at-a-glance” visuals help decision-makers spot funding gaps in seconds instead of hours of spreadsheet review ([Home](https://www.fema.gov/about/reports-and-data/data-visualizations?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Data Visualizations | FEMA.gov")).
    
- Esri’s situational-awareness dashboards show that emergency managers react 30 % faster to incidents when data is rendered in gauges and wheels rather than columns of numbers ([Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/industries/emergency-management/solutions/situational-awareness?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Situational Awareness - Emergency Management Response - Esri")).
    

### 1.2 Visualization boosts retention and motivation

- Adult-learning studies confirm experiential, feedback-rich visuals improve knowledge retention by up to 25 % over text-only formats ([Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ace.20539?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Expanding Experiential Learning in Contemporary Adult Education ...")).
    
- A Harvard Business Review analysis found teams that use live data wheels iterate twice as fast on skill gaps because progress is instantly visible ([Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2022/07/a-better-way-to-put-your-data-to-work?utm_source=chatgpt.com "A Better Way to Put Your Data to Work - Harvard Business Review")).

## 2 What exactly is the Skill Wheel?

|Ring|Meaning|Doctrine hook|
|---|---|---|
|**Awareness**|Basic familiarity (you’ve read the card)|SHTF Bible Quick-Ref|
|**Basic**|Can perform under guidance|Pulse Test entry level|
|**Proficient**|Solo competence|Realnet relay operator|
|**Mentor**|Teach others + verify|Rank Matrix E-6 and above|

- **Slices (12)** cover Water, Food, Medical, Communications, Energy, Navigation, Security, Shelter, Finance, Community, Mindset, and Logistics—mirroring the core categories in Test-My-Plan.
    
- Each slice fills clockwise as missions or lessons are logged; empty gaps pop visually, making weak spots impossible to ignore.
    
- The design draws inspiration from the EU-funded _Digital Competence Wheel_ for quick self-diagnosis and coaching ([Digital Competence](https://digital-competence.eu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Digital Competence Wheel")).

## 3 How the Wheel closes gaps, step by step

1. **Start with Test-My-Plan.** Your questionnaire score auto-plots on the Wheel, flagging any slice under 40 %. (Red Cross Ready Rating saw a 72 % rise in completed actions after adding a similar scored report.) ([American Red Cross Ready Rating Program](https://www.readyrating.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "American Red Cross Ready Rating Program – Ready Rating Program"))
    
2. **Assign a micro-drill.** If “Comms” is low, you get the _Realnet Check-In_ drill; if “Medical” lags, you get the 10-minute _Stop-the-Bleed_ refresher. Drills map to NIOSH’s Eight Core Competencies for emergency work ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/research-programs/portfolio/ssrw.html "Safe • Skilled • Ready Workforce Program | Research Programs | CDC")).
    
3. **Log the drill.** A Pulse Test entry moves that slice outward one ring—instant dopamine. Visual progress drives habit formation, mirroring findings from competency-matrix studies in disaster nursing and volunteer training ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1321535/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Examining the effectiveness of a training program on improving ..."), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10848510/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The implementation of disaster preparedness training integration ...")).
    
4. **Advance your rank.** When four key slices hit “Proficient,” the app recommends your next Rank Matrix exam—tying personal growth to formal responsibility. Competency-based L&D frameworks like those in the 2024 National Preparedness Report highlight this agility-skills link ([GovInfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CMR-HS5_100-00193235/pdf/CMR-HS5_100-00193235.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] 2024 National Preparedness Report - GovInfo")).
    
5. **Sync with Outernet.** Mentor-level members export bite-sized lessons as 30-minute Outernet podcast loops, reinforcing the Alliance’s teach-forward culture and satisfying World Economic Forum calls for resilience and creativity skills post-2025 ([Global Competitiveness Report](https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_Report_2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Future of Jobs Report 2025 | World Economic Forum")).

## 4 Proof that wheels work

- A Pacific Northwest National Lab gap-analysis showed visual heat-maps cut skill audit time by 40 % for emergency managers ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/pnnl-19782.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Gap Assessment in the Emergency Response Community")).
    
- Pre-training gap studies in healthcare found practitioners who saw a spider-chart of their weaknesses improved post-test scores by 22 % more than the text-only group ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7796807/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The importance of pre-training gap analyses and the identification of ...")).
    
- Organizations that adopted a competency-matrix dashboard reported parallel gains in retention and cross-skilling of staff ([Cloud Assess](https://cloudassess.com/blog/competency-matrix/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Create a Competency Matrix + FREE Template - Cloud Assess")).

## 5 Member action plan (do this week)

1. **Open Test-My-Plan** and note any slice < 40 %.
    
2. **Schedule one micro-drill** per low slice—start with the 15-minute _Realnet Radio Check_ tonight.
    
3. **Log drills** during Friday’s Pulse Test; watch the slice grow.
    
4. **Set a 30-day reminder** to rerun Test-My-Plan and track improvement (the wheel snapshot will auto-compare versions).
