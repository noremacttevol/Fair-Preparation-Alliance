## 1 Why rethink dues?

### 1.1 Traditional flat fees squeeze the mission

- Only 40 % of U.S. nonprofit members say dues feel “fair,” and price dissatisfaction is a top churn driver ([Nonprofit Financial Commons](https://nonprofitfinancials.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Webinar-Resource-Membership-Model_slides.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] The Evolved Membership Nonprofit:")).
    
- Sliding-scale or income-based fees boost retention and diversify membership ([Donorbox](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/nonprofit-funding-sources?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Top Funding Sources for Nonprofits and Charities in 2025 - Donorbox")).
    
- YouGov’s 2024 multi-country survey shows the public judges _fairness_, not the absolute number, when deciding to join ([YouGov](https://business.yougov.com/content/49709-fair-unfair-consumer-opinion-on-dynamic-pricing-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Fair or unfair? Consumer opinion on dynamic pricing in 2024")).
    

### 1.2 Dynamic pricing without transparency backfires

- Gartner warns that algorithmic surge models erode trust when members can’t see the math ([Consumer Goods Technology](https://consumergoods.com/dynamic-pricing-risks-eroding-consumer-trust-gartner?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Dynamic Pricing Risks Eroding Consumer Trust: Gartner")).
    
- Wendy’s 2025 “surge menu” preview triggered immediate social backlash and brand-risk headlines ([Food & Wine](https://www.foodandwine.com/why-dynamic-pricing-is-a-bad-idea-for-wendys-8602616?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Wendy's Still Plans to Introduce Dynamic Pricing in 2025 - Here's Why It May Not Be a Great Idea")).
    
- Financial Times notes consumers hate opaque price jumps and reward brands that cap or explain changes ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/202bb768-667a-4f6e-ac71-ba22f9d091b8?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Why everyone hates dynamic pricing")).

## 2 How FPA’s Dynamic Pricing Model works

|Milestone|Members|Monthly due|Monthly cap status|
|---|---|---|---|
|Launch|0–20 000|$5|Revenue grows toward cap|
|Scale-up 1|20 001–40 000|$4|Cap reaches $100 k then locks|
|...|…|…|…|
|Mature|≥100 000|$1|Surplus funneled to local squads|

- **Live audit feed:** A public ledger updates daily—mirroring Humble Bundle’s “money split” slider transparency ([Vizologi](https://vizologi.com/business-strategy-canvas/the-humble-bundle-business-model-canvas/ "What is The Humble Bundle's business model? | Vizologi")).
    
- **Vote-to-zero trigger:** If cap funds exceed project needs for 90 days, members can vote dues to $0 for a cycle. This cooperative-style rebate reflects best practice in member-owned co-ops ([ICA Group - Home](https://icagroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Setting-a-Share-Price.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Setting a Membership Share Price | ICA Group")).
    
- **No surprise surges:** Price only _falls_ as we grow; no algorithmic hikes—addressing fairness issues flagged in academic pricing studies ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811624000946?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Algorithmic pricing: Effects on consumer trust and price search")).

## 3 Proof that fair, falling prices can still fund growth

### 3.1 Sliding-scale memberships

- Nonprofit research shows sliding scales can _increase_ total dues by 19 % because volume outweighs lower per-head fees ([Nonprofit Financial Commons](https://nonprofitfinancials.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Webinar-Resource-Membership-Model_slides.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] The Evolved Membership Nonprofit:")).
    
- Co-operatives that rebate or reduce dues after growth see higher governance participation ([Co-operatives First](https://cooperativesfirst.com/blog/2018/05/10/5-ways-to-increase-membership-engagement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "5 ways to increase membership engagement - Co-operatives First")).
    

### 3.2 “Pay-what-you-want” precedents

- Humble Bundle’s flexible model has moved over $240 million to charity while maintaining company margins ([Vizologi](https://vizologi.com/business-strategy-canvas/the-humble-bundle-business-model-canvas/ "What is The Humble Bundle's business model? | Vizologi")).
    
- Medium case studies show top 3 % of pay-what-you-want buyers offset low contributions, keeping revenue stable ([Medium](https://medium.com/%40tmorkes/pay-what-you-want-the-ultimate-sales-strategy-4030c63c5798?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Pay What You Want: The Ultimate Sales Strategy | by Tom Morkes")).
    

### 3.3 Creator-economy insights

- Patreon finds tier-optimizing creators grow 30 % faster; the key is visible benefit-to-price alignment ([SBI Growth](https://sbigrowth.com/insights/patreon-pricing-page-teardown?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Patreon's Pricing Strategy: Building Relationships and Revenue")).
    
- Patreon's 2025 guide advises transparent tier changes to avoid churn—mirroring FPA’s public ledger ([Patreon Help Center](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/24879210577165-How-to-adjust-your-membership-tier-prices-a-guide-for-creators?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to adjust your membership tier prices: a guide for creators")).
    

### 3.4 Academic fairness & trust

- Oxford Journal research links visible, rules-based pricing to higher perceived fairness even when prices differ ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13567667221095583?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The influence of dynamic pricing on consumer trust, value, and ...")).
    
- Forbes 2024 warns hidden dynamic algorithms hurt trust but applauds “rule-based caps” as a fix ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sushmadaggubati/2024/10/15/unlocking-profit-and-building-customer-trust-with-dynamic-pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Unlocking Profit And Building Customer Trust With Dynamic Pricing")).

## 4 Scenario: Path to the $100 k cap

> **Assumptions:** 1 % weekly growth, 3 % churn, typical nonprofit payment success rates.

|Week|Members|Due ($)|Monthly rev ($)|Cap hit?|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|5|0|—|
|12|≈ 10 400|5|52 000|No|
|24|≈ 20 900|**4**|83 600|No|
|28|≈ 24 000|4|**96 000**|≈ Cap|
|30|≈ 25 500|4|**102 000**|**Cap locks; dues freeze**|

_At ~25 k members we hit the cap; every additional user drives dues _down_, never up—turning growth into a visible community dividend._

## 5 Member action steps

1. **Check the live audit feed** tonight—see exactly where dues flow.
    
2. **Invite three friends**; show them how price drops as the circle widens.
    
3. **Propose a local project** via the Funding Dashboard; cap surplus can be earmarked for squad gear.

### Closing thought

Fair funding isn’t charity—it’s infrastructure. By capping revenue, lowering dues in stride, and broadcasting every penny, FPA turns _pricing_ itself into proof of our charter: decentralization, transparency, and member-powered resilience. Grow the circle, drop the cost, and let the numbers speak for themselves.
