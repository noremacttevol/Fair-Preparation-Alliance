## How we picked the flagship topic

- **High public pain-point:** Island-wide outages are hitting headlines again—Puerto Rico’s April 2025 blackout left 1.4 million without power for two days [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/puerto-rico-plunged-darkness-island-wide-blackout-hits/story?id=120884304).
    
- **FPA differentiation:** Government guidance still centers on cell alerts and social media; FEMA’s own manual flags “rumor and speculation” problems when networks fail [FEMA University](https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is242b/student%20manual/sm_03.pdf). Our Realnet + Outernet stack fills that gap.
    
- **News momentum:** AI-driven data-center growth could consume up to 12 % of U.S. electricity by 2028, straining grids unless new infrastructure appears [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-urge-senators-speed-permitting-ai-boost-government-data-access-2025-05-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Utility Dive](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/sustainable-ai-requires-close-collaboration-between-data-centers-grid-st/747014/).
    
- **Doctrine match:** Offline-First is already baked into Mk1 Mod 3 (Faraday-caged radios, printable SHTF Bible), so we can quote existing SOPs without inventing new features.

## Why lead with Offline-First Resilience

1. **Everybody feels the risk.** Federal reports link aging infrastructure and extreme weather to longer, costlier outages, urging immediate resilience upgrades [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/EXEC-2023-003585%20-%20Congressional%20Report%20on%20Preventing%20Outages%20and%20Enhancing%20the%20Resilience%20of%20the%20Electric%20Grid_sb-S1_7.1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
2. **We already have the assets.** Realnet weekly nets, Outernet content seeds, and the printable SHTF Bible are all Mk1 Mod 3 deliverables—no vaporware.
    
3. **Story bridges to the rest.** Once readers grasp Realnet radios, the next logical breadcrumb is the Skill Wheel rank path tied to on-air drills.
    
4. **Media-friendly proof points.** Amateur-radio after-action reports show successful message relays during hurricanes when cellular failed [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Public%20Service/ARES/2017%20Hurricane%20Season%20AAR.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
